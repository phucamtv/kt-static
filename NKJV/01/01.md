<span class="verse sa_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 102:25; Is. 40:21; (John 1:1–3; Heb. 1:10)">⚓</a>beginning <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:4; (Ps. 8:3; 89:11; 90:2); Is. 44:24; Acts 17:24; Rom. 1:20; (Heb. 1:2; 11:3); Rev. 4:11">⚓</a>God created the heavens and the earth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_2"><sup>2</sup>The earth was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 4:23">⚓</a>without form, and void; and darkness <i>was</i> on the face of the deep. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 6:3); Job 26:13; Ps. 33:6; 104:30; Is. 40:13, 14">⚓</a>And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_1_3"> <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 33:6, 9">⚓</a>Then God said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 4:6">⚓</a>“Let there be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 11:3)">⚓</a>light”; and there was light. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_4"><sup>4</sup>And God saw the light, that <i>it</i> <i>was</i> good; and God divided the light from the darkness. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_5"><sup>5</sup>God called the light Day, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 37:18; Ps. 19:2; 33:6; 74:16; 104:20; 136:5; Jer. 10:12">⚓</a>darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_1_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then God said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 37:18; Jer. 10:12; 2 Pet. 3:5">⚓</a>“Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_7"><sup>7</sup>Thus God made the firmament, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 38:8–11; Prov. 8:27–29">⚓</a>and divided the waters which <i>were</i> under the firmament from the waters which <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 148:4">⚓</a>above the firmament; and it was so. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_8"><sup>8</sup>And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_1_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then God said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 26:10; Ps. 104:6–9; Prov. 8:29; Jer. 5:22; 2 Pet. 3:5">⚓</a>“Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 24:1, 2; 33:7; 95:5">⚓</a>let the dry <i>land</i> appear”; and it was so. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_10"><sup>10</sup>And God called the dry <i>land</i> Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that <i>it</i> <i>was</i> good.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_1_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then God said, “Let the earth <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 65:9–13; 104:14; Heb. 6:7">⚓</a>bring forth grass, the herb <i>that</i> yields seed, <i>and</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:1; Luke 6:44">⚓</a>fruit tree <i>that</i> yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed <i>is</i> in itself, on the earth”; and it was so. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_12"><sup>12</sup>And the earth brought forth grass, the herb <i>that</i> yields seed according to its kind, and the tree <i>that</i> yields fruit, whose seed <i>is</i> in itself according to its kind. And God saw that <i>it</i> <i>was</i> good. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_13"><sup>13</sup>So the evening and the morning were the third day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_1_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then God said, “Let there be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:19; Ps. 74:16; 136:5–9">⚓</a>lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 104:19">⚓</a>seasons, and for days and years; </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_15"><sup>15</sup>and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light on the earth”; and it was so. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_16"><sup>16</sup>Then God made two great lights: the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 136:8">⚓</a>greater light to rule the day, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:3; Ps. 8:3">⚓</a>lesser light to rule the night. <i>He</i> <i>made</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:19; Job 38:7; Is. 40:26">⚓</a>the stars also. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_17"><sup>17</sup>God set them in the firmament of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:5; Jer. 33:20, 25">⚓</a>heavens to give light on the earth, </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_18"><sup>18</sup>and to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 31:35">⚓</a>rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that <i>it</i> <i>was</i> good. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_19"><sup>19</sup>So the evening and the morning were the fourth day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_1_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then God said, “Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_21"><sup>21</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 104:25–28">⚓</a>God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that <i>it</i> <i>was</i> good. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_22"><sup>22</sup>And God blessed them, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 8:17">⚓</a>“Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_23"><sup>23</sup>So the evening and the morning were the fifth day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_1_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, <i>each</i> according to its kind”; and it was so. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_25"><sup>25</sup>And God made the beast of the earth according to its kind, cattle according to its kind, and everything that creeps on the earth according to its kind. And God saw that <i>it</i> <i>was</i> good.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_1_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then God said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:6; Ps. 100:3; Eccl. 7:29; (Eph. 4:24); James 3:9">⚓</a>“Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:2; Ps. 8:6–8">⚓</a>let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_27"><sup>27</sup>So God created man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 5:2; 1 Cor. 11:7">⚓</a>in His <i>own</i> image; in the image of God He created him; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:4; (Mark 10:6–8)">⚓</a>male and female He created them. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_28"><sup>28</sup>Then God blessed them, and God said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:1, 7; Lev. 26:9">⚓</a>“Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 9:27">⚓</a>subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_1_29"> <sup>29</sup>And God said, “See, I have given you every herb <i>that</i> yields seed which <i>is</i> on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:3; Ps. 104:14, 15">⚓</a>to you it shall be for food. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_30"><sup>30</sup>Also, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 145:15">⚓</a>every beast of the earth, to every <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 38:41">⚓</a>bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which <i>there</i> <i>is</i> life, <i>I</i> <i>have</i> <i>given</i> every green herb for food”; and it was so. </span>
<span class="verse sa_1_31"><sup>31</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 104:24; 1 Tim. 4:4)">⚓</a>God saw everything that He had made, and indeed <i>it</i> <i>was</i> very good. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day.<br/></span>
