<span class="verse sa_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>Thus the heavens and the earth, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 33:6">⚓</a>all the host of them, were finished. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:9–11; 31:17; Heb. 4:4, 10">⚓</a>And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_3"><sup>3</sup>Then God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 58:13)">⚓</a>blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:1; Ps. 90:1, 2">⚓</a>This <i>is</i> the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, </span>

<span class="verse sa_2_6"><sup>6</sup>but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_7"> <sup>7</sup>And the Lord God formed man <i>of</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:19, 23; Ps. 103:14">⚓</a>dust of the ground, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 33:4">⚓</a>breathed into his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 7:22">⚓</a>nostrils the breath of life; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:45">⚓</a>man became a living being.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Life in God’s Garden</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_2_8"> <sup>8</sup>The Lord God planted <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 51:3">⚓</a>a garden <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:23, 24">⚓</a>eastward in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:16">⚓</a>Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_9"><sup>9</sup>And out of the ground the Lord God made <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 31:8">⚓</a>every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 3:22; Rev. 2:7; 22:2, 14)">⚓</a>The tree of life <i>was</i> also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 1:39)">⚓</a>evil.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it parted and became four riverheads. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_11"><sup>11</sup>The name of the first <i>is</i> Pishon; it <i>is</i> the one which skirts <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:18">⚓</a>the whole land of Havilah, where <i>there</i> <i>is</i> gold. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_12"><sup>12</sup>And the gold of that land <i>is</i> good. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:7">⚓</a>Bdellium and the onyx stone <i>are</i> there. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_13"><sup>13</sup>The name of the second river <i>is</i> Gihon; it <i>is</i> the one which goes around the whole land of Cush. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_14"><sup>14</sup>The name of the third river <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:4">⚓</a>Hiddekel; it <i>is</i> the one which goes toward the east of Assyria. The fourth river <i>is</i> the Euphrates.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_16"><sup>16</sup>And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_17"><sup>17</sup>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:1, 3, 11, 17">⚓</a>you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:3, 19; (Rom. 6:23)">⚓</a>you shall surely <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 5:12; 1 Cor. 15:21, 22">⚓</a>die.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_18"> <sup>18</sup>And the Lord God said, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> not good that man should be alone; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 11:8, 9; 1 Tim. 2:13">⚓</a>I will make him a helper comparable to him.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:20, 24">⚓</a>Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 8:6">⚓</a>brought <i>them</i> to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that <i>was</i> its name. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_20"><sup>20</sup>So Adam gave names to all cattle, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_21"> <sup>21</sup>And the Lord God caused a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:12; 1 Sam. 26:12">⚓</a>deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. </span>
<span class="verse sa_2_22"><sup>22</sup>Then the rib which the Lord God had taken from man He made into a woman, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:20; 1 Tim. 2:13">⚓</a>and He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 13:4">⚓</a>brought her to the man.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_23"> <sup>23</sup>And Adam said:<br/>  “This <i>is</i> now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:14; Eph. 5:28–30">⚓</a>bone of my bones<br/>   And flesh of my flesh;<br/>   She shall be called Woman,<br/>   Because she was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 11:8, 9">⚓</a>taken out of Man.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_24"> <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:5; Eph. 5:31">⚓</a>Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 10:6–8; 1 Cor. 6:16">⚓</a>be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_2_25"> <sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:7, 10">⚓</a>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 47:3">⚓</a>ashamed.<br/></span>
