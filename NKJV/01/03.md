<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>The Temptation and Fall of Man</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 21:1; (Rev. 12:9; 20:2, 10)">⚓</a>the serpent was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 11:3">⚓</a>more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_2"> <sup>2</sup>And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:16, 17">⚓</a>fruit of the trees of the garden; </span>
<span class="verse sa_3_3"><sup>3</sup>but of the fruit of the tree which <i>is</i> in the midst of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:12, 13; Rev. 22:14">⚓</a>touch it, lest you die.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:44; (2 Cor. 11:3; 1 Tim. 2:14)">⚓</a>Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. </span>
<span class="verse sa_3_5"><sup>5</sup>For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_6"> <sup>6</sup>So when the woman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 John 2:16">⚓</a>saw that the tree <i>was</i> good for food, that it <i>was</i> pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make <i>one</i> wise, she took of its fruit <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 2:14">⚓</a>and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. </span>
<span class="verse sa_3_7"><sup>7</sup>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:25">⚓</a>and they knew that they <i>were</i> naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_8"> <sup>8</sup>And they heard <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 38:1">⚓</a>the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 31:33; Jer. 23:24">⚓</a>hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then the Lord God called to Adam and said to him, “Where <i>are</i> you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_10"> <sup>10</sup>So he said, “I heard Your voice in the garden, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:25; Ex. 3:6; Deut. 9:19; 1 John 3:20">⚓</a>and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_11"> <sup>11</sup>And He said, “Who told you that you <i>were</i> naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then the man said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 28:13)">⚓</a>“The woman whom You gave <i>to</i> <i>be</i> with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_13"> <sup>13</sup>And the Lord God said to the woman, “What <i>is</i> this you have done?”<br/> The woman said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:4; 2 Cor. 11:3; 1 Tim. 2:14">⚓</a>“The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_14"> <sup>14</sup>So the Lord God said to the serpent:<br/>  “Because you have done this,<br/>   You <i>are</i> cursed more than all cattle,<br/>   And more than every beast of the field;<br/>   On your belly you shall go,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:15–20; Is. 65:25; Mic. 7:17">⚓</a>you shall eat dust<br/>   All the days of your life.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_15">   <sup>15</sup>And I will put enmity<br/>   Between you and the woman,<br/>   And between <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:44; Acts 13:10; 1 John 3:8">⚓</a>your seed and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 7:14; Luke 1:31, 34, 35; Gal. 4:4">⚓</a>her Seed;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 16:20; (Rev. 12:7, 17)">⚓</a>He shall bruise your head,<br/>   And you shall bruise His heel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_16"> <sup>16</sup>To the woman He said:<br/>  “I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 13:8; John 16:21">⚓</a>In pain you shall bring forth children;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:7">⚓</a>Your desire <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> for your husband,<br/>   And he shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 11:3; Eph. 5:22; 1 Tim. 2:12, 15">⚓</a>rule over you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then to Adam He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:23">⚓</a>“Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:17">⚓</a>of which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it’:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 5:29; Rom. 8:20–22; Heb. 6:8">⚓</a>“Cursed <i>is</i> the ground for your sake;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 5:7; 14:1; Eccl. 2:23">⚓</a>In toil you shall eat <i>of</i> it<br/>   All the days of your life.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_18">   <sup>18</sup>Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 104:14">⚓</a>you shall eat the herb of the field.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_19">   <sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Thess. 3:10">⚓</a>In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread<br/>   Till you return to the ground,<br/>   For out of it you were taken;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:7; 5:5">⚓</a>For dust you <i>are,</i><br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 21:26; Eccl. 3:20">⚓</a>to dust you shall return.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_20"> <sup>20</sup>And Adam called his wife’s name <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 11:3; 1 Tim. 2:13">⚓</a>Eve, because she was the mother of all living.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_21"> <sup>21</sup>Also for Adam and his wife the Lord God made tunics of skin, and clothed them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_3_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then the Lord God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever”— </span>
<span class="verse sa_3_23"><sup>23</sup>therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:2; 9:20">⚓</a>to till the ground from which he was taken. </span>
<span class="verse sa_3_24"><sup>24</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 31:3, 11">⚓</a>He drove out the man; and He placed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:18–22; Ps. 104:4; Ezek. 10:1–20; Heb. 1:7">⚓</a>cherubim <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:8">⚓</a>at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:9; (Rev. 22:2)">⚓</a>life.<br/></span>
