<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Cain Murders Abel</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, “I have acquired a man from the Lord.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_2"><sup>2</sup>Then she bore again, this time his brother Abel. Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 11:50, 51">⚓</a>Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_3"><sup>3</sup>And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 18:12">⚓</a>of the ground to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_4"><sup>4</sup>Abel also brought of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 18:17">⚓</a>the firstborn of his flock and of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 3:16">⚓</a>their fat. And the Lord respected <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 11:4">⚓</a>Abel and his offering, </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_5"><sup>5</sup>but He did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_6"> <sup>6</sup>So the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_7"><sup>7</sup>If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door. And its desire <i>is</i> for you, but you should rule over it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 23:35; Luke 11:51; (1 John 3:12–15); Jude 11">⚓</a>killed him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where <i>is</i> Abel your brother?”<br/> He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:44">⚓</a>“I do not know. <i>Am</i> I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 8:11–13">⚓</a>my brother’s keeper?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_10"> <sup>10</sup>And He said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:33; Deut. 21:1–9; Heb. 12:24; Rev. 6:9, 10">⚓</a>cries out to Me from the ground. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_11"><sup>11</sup>So now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:14; Deut. 11:28; 28:15–20; Gal. 3:10">⚓</a>you <i>are</i> cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_12"><sup>12</sup>When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>And Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment <i>is</i> greater than I can bear! </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_14"><sup>14</sup>Surely You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 51:11">⚓</a>I shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:18; Is. 1:15">⚓</a>hidden from Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, and it will happen <i>that</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:6; Num. 35:19, 21, 27">⚓</a>anyone who finds me will kill me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_15"> <sup>15</sup>And the Lord said to him, “Therefore, whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:24; Ps. 79:12">⚓</a>sevenfold.” And the Lord set a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:6; Ezek. 9:4, 6">⚓</a>mark on Cain, lest anyone finding him should kill him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Family of Cain</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_4_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then Cain <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 13:23; 24:20; Jer. 23:39; 52:3">⚓</a>went out from the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jon. 1:3">⚓</a>presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_17"><sup>17</sup>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Ē´noch. And he built a city, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 49:11">⚓</a>and called the name of the city after the name of his son—Ē´noch. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_18"><sup>18</sup>To Ē´noch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then Lamech took for himself <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:24; 16:3; 1 Tim. 3:2">⚓</a>two wives: the name of one <i>was</i> Adah, and the name of the second <i>was</i> Zillah. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_20"><sup>20</sup>And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_21"><sup>21</sup>His brother’s name <i>was</i> Jubal. He was the father of all those who play the harp and flute. </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_22"><sup>22</sup>And as for Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every craftsman in bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain <i>was</i> Naamah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then Lamech said to his wives:<br/>  “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;<br/>   Wives of Lamech, listen to my speech!<br/>   For I have killed a man for wounding me,<br/>   Even a young man for hurting me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_4_24">   <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:15">⚓</a>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,<br/>   Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A New Son</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_4_25"> <sup>25</sup>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 5:3">⚓</a>named him Seth, “For God has appointed another seed for me instead of Abel, whom Cain killed.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_4_26"><sup>26</sup>And as for Seth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 5:6">⚓</a>to him also a son was born; and he named him Ē´nosh. Then <i>men</i> began <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:8; 26:25; 1 Kin. 18:24; Ps. 116:17; Joel 2:32; Zeph. 3:9; 1 Cor. 1:2">⚓</a>to call on the name of the Lord.<br/></span>
