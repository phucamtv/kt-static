<span class="verse sa_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:28">⚓</a>when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them, </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_2"><sup>2</sup>that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they <i>were</i> beautiful; and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:3, 4">⚓</a>took wives for themselves of all whom they chose.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_6_3"> <sup>3</sup>And the Lord said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:38; (Gal. 5:16, 17); 1 Pet. 3:19, 20">⚓</a>“My Spirit shall not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Thess. 2:7">⚓</a>strive with man forever, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:39">⚓</a>for he <i>is</i> indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_4"><sup>4</sup>There were giants on the earth in those <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:32, 33; Luke 17:27">⚓</a>days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore <i>children</i> to them. Those <i>were</i> the mighty men who <i>were</i> of old, men of renown.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_6_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man <i>was</i> great in the earth, and <i>that</i> every <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 8:21; Ps. 14:1–3; Prov. 6:18; Matt. 15:19; Rom. 1:28–32">⚓</a>intent of the thoughts of his heart <i>was</i> only evil continually. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_6"><sup>6</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 6:7; 1 Sam. 15:11, 29; 2 Sam. 24:16; Jer. 18:7–10; Zech. 8:14">⚓</a>the Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:40; Is. 63:10; Eph. 4:30">⚓</a>He was grieved in His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 3:5">⚓</a>heart. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_7"><sup>7</sup>So the Lord said, “I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 7:4, 23; Deut. 28:63; 29:20; Ps. 7:11">⚓</a>destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_8"><sup>8</sup>But Noah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:19; Ex. 33:12, 17; Luke 1:30; Acts 7:46">⚓</a>found grace in the eyes of the Lord.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Noah Pleases God</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_6_9"> <sup>9</sup>This is the genealogy of Noah. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 7:1; Ezek. 14:14, 20; Heb. 11:7; 2 Pet. 2:5">⚓</a>Noah was a just man, perfect in his generations. Noah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 5:22, 24; 2 Kin. 23:3">⚓</a>walked with God. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_10"><sup>10</sup>And Noah begot three sons: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 5:32; 7:13">⚓</a>Shem, Ham, and Japheth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_6_11"> <sup>11</sup>The earth also was corrupt <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:29; Judg. 2:19; Rom. 2:13">⚓</a>before God, and the earth was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 8:17">⚓</a>filled with violence. </span>
<span class="verse sa_6_12"><sup>12</sup>So God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 14:2; 53:2, 3">⚓</a>looked upon the earth, and indeed it was corrupt; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 14:1–3; Is. 28:8">⚓</a>all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Ark Prepared</h3></div>
