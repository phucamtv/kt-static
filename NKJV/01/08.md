<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>Noah’s Deliverance</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:29; Ex. 2:24; 1 Sam. 1:19; Ps. 105:42; 106:4">⚓</a>remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the animals that <i>were</i> with him in the ark. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:21; 15:10; Job 12:15; Ps. 29:10; Is. 44:27; Nah. 1:4">⚓</a>And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 7:11">⚓</a>The fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 11:17">⚓</a>stopped, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 7:4, 12; Job 38:37">⚓</a>the rain from heaven was restrained. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_3"><sup>3</sup>And the waters receded continually from the earth. At the end <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 7:24">⚓</a>of the hundred and fifty days the waters decreased. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_4"><sup>4</sup>Then the ark rested in the seventh month, the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_5"><sup>5</sup>And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month. In the tenth <i>month,</i> on the first <i>day</i> of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_8_6"> <sup>6</sup>So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 6:16">⚓</a>opened the window of the ark which he had made. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_7"><sup>7</sup>Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_8"><sup>8</sup>He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_9"><sup>9</sup>But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and she returned into the ark to him, for the waters <i>were</i> on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her, and drew her into the ark to himself. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_10"><sup>10</sup>And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent the dove out from the ark. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_11"><sup>11</sup>Then the dove came to him in the evening, and behold, a freshly plucked olive leaf <i>was</i> in her mouth; and Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_12"><sup>12</sup>So he waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove, which did not return again to him anymore.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_8_13"> <sup>13</sup>And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first <i>month,</i> the first <i>day</i> of the month, that the waters were dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and indeed the surface of the ground was dry. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_14"><sup>14</sup>And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dried.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_8_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then God spoke to Noah, saying, </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_16"><sup>16</sup>“Go out of the ark, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 7:13">⚓</a>you and your wife, and your sons and your sons’ wives with you. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_17"><sup>17</sup>Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that <i>is</i> with you: birds and cattle and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, so that they may abound on the earth, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:22, 28; 9:1, 7">⚓</a>be fruitful and multiply on the earth.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_18"><sup>18</sup>So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_19"><sup>19</sup>Every animal, every creeping thing, every bird, <i>and</i> whatever creeps on the earth, according to their families, went out of the ark.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>God’s Covenant with Creation</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_8_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then Noah built an <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:7; Ex. 29:18, 25">⚓</a>altar to the Lord, and took of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 7:2; Lev. 11">⚓</a>every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:2; Ex. 10:25">⚓</a>burnt offerings on the altar. </span>
<span class="verse sa_8_21"><sup>21</sup>And the Lord smelled <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:18, 25; Lev. 1:9; Ezek. 20:41; 2 Cor. 2:15; Eph. 5:2">⚓</a>a soothing aroma. Then the Lord said in His heart, “I will never again <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:17; 6:7, 13, 17; Is. 54:9">⚓</a>curse the ground for man’s sake, although the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 6:5; 11:6; Job 14:4; Ps. 51:5; Jer. 17:9; Rom. 1:21; 3:23; Eph. 2:1–3">⚓</a>imagination of man’s heart <i>is</i> evil from his youth; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:11, 15">⚓</a>nor will I again destroy every living thing as I have done.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_8_22">  <sup>22</sup>“While the earth <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 54:9">⚓</a>remains,<br/>   Seedtime and harvest,<br/>   Cold and heat,<br/>   Winter and summer,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 74:16; Jer. 33:20, 25">⚓</a>day and night<br/>   Shall not cease.”<br/></span>
