<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>God’s Promise to Noah</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:28, 29; 8:17; 9:7, 19; 10:32">⚓</a>“Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:26, 28; Ps. 8:6">⚓</a>And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be on every beast of the earth, on every bird of the air, on all that move <i>on</i> the earth, and on all the fish of the sea. They are given into your hand. </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:15; 14:3, 9, 11; Acts 10:12, 13">⚓</a>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have given you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 14:14, 20; 1 Cor. 10:23, 26; Col. 2:16; (1 Tim. 4:3, 4)">⚓</a>all things, even as the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:29">⚓</a>green herbs. </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 7:26; 17:10–16; 19:26; Deut. 12:16, 23; 15:23; 1 Sam. 14:33, 34; Acts 15:20, 29">⚓</a>But you shall not eat flesh with its life, <i>that</i> <i>is,</i> its blood. </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_5"><sup>5</sup>Surely for your lifeblood I will demand <i>a</i> <i>reckoning;</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 21:28">⚓</a>from the hand of every beast I will require it, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:9, 10; Ps. 9:12">⚓</a>from the hand of man. From the hand of every <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 17:26">⚓</a>man’s brother I will require the life of man.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_9_6">  <sup>6</sup>“Whoever <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 21:12–14; Lev. 24:17; Num. 35:33; Matt. 26:52">⚓</a>sheds man’s blood,<br/>   By man his blood shall be shed;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:26, 27">⚓</a>For in the image of God<br/>   He made man.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_9_7">   <sup>7</sup>And as for you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:1, 19">⚓</a>be fruitful and multiply;<br/>   Bring forth abundantly in the earth<br/>   And multiply in it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_9_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying: </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_9"><sup>9</sup>“And as for Me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 6:18">⚓</a>behold, I establish <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 54:9">⚓</a>My covenant with you and with your descendants after you, </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 145:9">⚓</a>and with every living creature that <i>is</i> with you: the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you, of all that go out of the ark, every beast of the earth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_11"><sup>11</sup>Thus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 8:21; Is. 54:9">⚓</a>I establish My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood; never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_9_12"> <sup>12</sup>And God said: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:13, 17; 17:11">⚓</a>“This <i>is</i> the sign of the covenant which I make between Me and you, and every living creature that <i>is</i> with you, for perpetual generations: </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_13"><sup>13</sup>I set <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:28; Rev. 4:3">⚓</a>My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_14"><sup>14</sup>It shall be, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud; </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_15"><sup>15</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:42, 45; Deut. 7:9; Ezek. 16:60">⚓</a>I will remember My covenant which <i>is</i> between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_16"><sup>16</sup>The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will look on it to remember <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:13, 19; 2 Sam. 23:5; Is. 55:3; Jer. 32:40; Heb. 13:20">⚓</a>the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that <i>is</i> on the earth.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_17"><sup>17</sup>And God said to Noah, “This <i>is</i> the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that <i>is</i> on the earth.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Noah and His Sons</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_9_18"> <sup>18</sup>Now the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:25–27; 10:6">⚓</a>And Ham <i>was</i> the father of Canaan. </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 5:32">⚓</a>These three <i>were</i> the sons of Noah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:1, 7; 10:32; 1 Chr. 1:4">⚓</a>and from these the whole earth was populated.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_9_20"> <sup>20</sup>And Noah began <i>to</i> <i>be</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:19, 23; 4:2; Prov. 12:11; Jer. 31:24">⚓</a>a farmer, and he planted a vineyard. </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_21"><sup>21</sup>Then he drank of the wine <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 20:1; Eph. 5:18">⚓</a>and was drunk, and became uncovered in his tent. </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_22"><sup>22</sup>And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside. </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:12; Gal. 6:1">⚓</a>But Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid <i>it</i> on both their shoulders, and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces <i>were</i> turned away, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_9_24"> <sup>24</sup>So Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_25"><sup>25</sup>Then he said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 27:16; Josh. 9:23, 27">⚓</a>“Cursed <i>be</i> Canaan;<br/>   A <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:23; 1 Kin. 9:20, 21">⚓</a>servant of servants<br/>   He shall be to his brethren.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_9_26"> <sup>26</sup>And he said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:20; 24:27; Ps. 144:15; Heb. 11:16">⚓</a>“Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord,<br/>   The God of Shem,<br/>   And may Canaan be his servant.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_9_27">   <sup>27</sup>May God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 10:2–5; 39:3; Is. 66:19">⚓</a>enlarge Japheth,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 3:36; John 1:14; Eph. 2:13, 14; 3:6">⚓</a>And may he dwell in the tents of Shem;<br/>   And may Canaan be his servant.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_9_28"> <sup>28</sup>And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. </span>
<span class="verse sa_9_29"><sup>29</sup>So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years; and he died.<br/></span>
