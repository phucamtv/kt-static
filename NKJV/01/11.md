<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>The Tower of Babel</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the whole earth had one language and one speech. </span>
<span class="verse sa_11_2"><sup>2</sup>And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 10:10; 14:1; Dan. 1:2">⚓</a>of Shinar, and they dwelt there. </span>
<span class="verse sa_11_3"><sup>3</sup>Then they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and bake <i>them</i> thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar. </span>
<span class="verse sa_11_4"><sup>4</sup>And they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:28; 9:1; Ps. 107:26">⚓</a>whose top <i>is</i> in the heavens; let us make a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 6:4; 2 Sam. 8:13">⚓</a>name for ourselves, lest we <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:27">⚓</a>be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_11_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:21; Ex. 3:8; 19:11, 18, 20">⚓</a>But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. </span>
<span class="verse sa_11_6"><sup>6</sup>And the Lord said, “Indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:19; Acts 17:26">⚓</a>the people <i>are</i> one and they all have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 11:1">⚓</a>one language, and this is what they begin to do; now nothing that they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:21; Ps. 2:1">⚓</a>propose to do will be withheld from them. </span>
<span class="verse sa_11_7"><sup>7</sup>Come, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:26">⚓</a>let Us go down and there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:23; Ex. 4:11; Deut. 28:49; Is. 33:19; Jer. 5:15">⚓</a>confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_11_8"><sup>8</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 11:4; Deut. 32:8; Ps. 92:9; (Luke 1:51)">⚓</a>the Lord scattered them abroad from there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 10:25, 32">⚓</a>over the face of all the earth, and they ceased building the city. </span>
<span class="verse sa_11_9"><sup>9</sup>Therefore its name is called Babel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 14:23">⚓</a>because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.<br/></span>
