<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>Promises to Abram</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:7; Acts 7:2, 3; (Heb. 11:8)">⚓</a>Lord had said to Abram:<br/>  “Get <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:9">⚓</a>out of your country,<br/>   From your family<br/>   And from your father’s house,<br/>   To a land that I will show you.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_12_2">   <sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 17:4–6); 18:18; 46:3; Deut. 26:5; 1 Kin. 3:8">⚓</a>I will make you a great nation;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:17; 24:35">⚓</a>I will bless you<br/>   And make your name great;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:4; Zech. 8:13; Gal. 3:14">⚓</a>And you shall be a blessing.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_12_3">   <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:35; 27:29; Ex. 23:22; Num. 24:9">⚓</a>I will bless those who bless you,<br/>   And I will curse him who curses you;<br/>   And in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14; Ps. 72:17; Matt. 1:1; Luke 3:34; Acts 3:25; (Gal. 3:8)">⚓</a>you all the families of the earth shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 41:27">⚓</a>blessed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_12_4"> <sup>4</sup>So Abram departed as the Lord had spoken to him, and Lot went with him. And Abram <i>was</i> seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. </span>
<span class="verse sa_12_5"><sup>5</sup>Then Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:14">⚓</a>the people whom they had acquired in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 11:31">⚓</a>Haran, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:18">⚓</a>departed to go to the land of Canaan. So they came to the land of Canaan. </span>
<span class="verse sa_12_6"><sup>6</sup>Abram <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 11:9">⚓</a>passed through the land to the place of Shechem, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 11:30; Judg. 7:1">⚓</a>as far as the terebinth tree of Moreh. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 10:18, 19">⚓</a>And the Canaanites <i>were</i> then in the land.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_12_7"> <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:1; 18:1">⚓</a>Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:15; 15:18; 17:8; Deut. 34:4; Ps. 105:9–12; Acts 7:5; Gal. 3:16">⚓</a>“To your descendants I will give this land.” And there he built an <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:4, 18; 22:9">⚓</a>altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_12_8"><sup>8</sup>And he moved from there to the mountain east of Bethel, and he pitched his tent <i>with</i> Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; there he built an altar to the Lord and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:26; 13:4; 21:33">⚓</a>called on the name of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse sa_12_9"><sup>9</sup>So Abram journeyed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:1, 3; 20:1; 24:62">⚓</a>going on still toward the South.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Abram in Egypt</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_12_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now there was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:1">⚓</a>a famine in the land, and Abram <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:13">⚓</a>went down to Egypt to dwell there, for the famine <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:1">⚓</a>severe in the land. </span>
<span class="verse sa_12_11"><sup>11</sup>And it came to pass, when he was close to entering Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, “Indeed I know that you <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:14; 26:7; 29:17">⚓</a>a woman of beautiful countenance. </span>
<span class="verse sa_12_12"><sup>12</sup>Therefore it will happen, when the Egyptians see you, that they will say, ‘This <i>is</i> his wife’; and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:11; 26:7">⚓</a>will kill me, but they will let you live. </span>
<span class="verse sa_12_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:1–18; 26:6–11">⚓</a>Please say you <i>are</i> my <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:12">⚓</a>sister, that it may be well with me for your sake, and that I may live because of you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_12_14"> <sup>14</sup>So it was, when Abram came into Egypt, that the Egyptians saw the woman, that she <i>was</i> very beautiful. </span>
<span class="verse sa_12_15"><sup>15</sup>The princes of Pharaoh also saw her and commended her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken to Pharaoh’s house. </span>
<span class="verse sa_12_16"><sup>16</sup>He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:14">⚓</a>treated Abram well for her sake. He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:2">⚓</a>had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male and female servants, female donkeys, and camels.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_12_17"> <sup>17</sup>But the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:18; 1 Chr. 16:21; (Ps. 105:14)">⚓</a>plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. </span>
<span class="verse sa_12_18"><sup>18</sup>And Pharaoh called Abram and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:9, 10; 26:10">⚓</a>“What <i>is</i> this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she <i>was</i> your wife? </span>
<span class="verse sa_12_19"><sup>19</sup>Why did you say, ‘She <i>is</i> my sister’? I might have taken her as my wife. Now therefore, here is your wife; take <i>her</i> and go your way.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_12_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 21:1)">⚓</a>So Pharaoh commanded <i>his</i> men concerning him; and they sent him away, with his wife and all that he had.<br/></span>
