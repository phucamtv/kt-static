<span class="verse sa_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 11:30; 15:2, 3">⚓</a>had borne him no <i>children.</i> And she had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:16; 21:9">⚓</a>an Egyptian maidservant whose name was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 4:24">⚓</a>Hagar. </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:3">⚓</a>So Sarai said to Abram, “See now, the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:18">⚓</a>has restrained me from bearing <i>children.</i> Please, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:3, 9">⚓</a>go in to my maid; perhaps I shall obtain children by her.” And Abram <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:17">⚓</a>heeded the voice of Sarai. </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife, after Abram <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:4, 5">⚓</a>had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan. </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_4"><sup>4</sup>So he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress became <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:6, 7; (Prov. 30:21, 23)">⚓</a>despised in her eyes.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Sarai said to Abram, “My wrong <i>be</i> upon you! I gave my maid into your embrace; and when she saw that she had conceived, I became despised in her eyes. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:53; Ex. 5:21">⚓</a>The Lord judge between you and me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_6"> <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Pet. 3:7">⚓</a>So Abram said to Sarai, “Indeed your maid <i>is</i> in your hand; do to her as you please.” And when Sarai dealt harshly with her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:9; Ex. 2:15">⚓</a>she fled from her presence.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:17, 18; 22:11, 15; 31:11">⚓</a>Angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:1; 25:18">⚓</a>by the spring on the way to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:22">⚓</a>Shur. </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_8"><sup>8</sup>And He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s maid, where have you come from, and where are you going?”<br/> She said, “I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_9"> <sup>9</sup>The Angel of the Lord said to her, “Return to your mistress, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Titus 2:9)">⚓</a>submit yourself under her hand.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_10"><sup>10</sup>Then the Angel of the Lord said to her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:20">⚓</a>“I will multiply your descendants exceedingly, so that they shall not be counted for multitude.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_11"><sup>11</sup>And the Angel of the Lord said to her:<br/>  “Behold, you <i>are</i> with child,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:13, 31">⚓</a>And you shall bear a son.<br/>   You shall call his name Ishmael,<br/>   Because the Lord has heard your affliction.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_12">   <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:20; Job 24:5; 39:5–8">⚓</a>He shall be a wild man;<br/>   His hand <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> against every man,<br/>   And every man’s hand against him.<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:18">⚓</a>And he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees; for she said, “Have I also here seen Him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:42">⚓</a>who sees me?” </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_14"><sup>14</sup>Therefore the well was called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:62">⚓</a>Beer Lahai Roi; observe, <i>it</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:7; Num. 13:26">⚓</a>between Kadesh and Bered.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_16_15"> <sup>15</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 4:22">⚓</a>Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. </span>
<span class="verse sa_16_16"><sup>16</sup>Abram <i>was</i> eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.<br/></span>
