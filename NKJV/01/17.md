<span class="verse sa_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:7; 18:1">⚓</a>appeared to Abram and said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:3; 35:11; Ex. 6:3; Job 42:2">⚓</a>“I <i>am</i> Almighty God; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:3">⚓</a>walk before Me and be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 6:9; Deut. 18:13">⚓</a>blameless. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_2"><sup>2</sup>And I will make My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:18; Ex. 6:4; (Gal. 3:19)">⚓</a>covenant between Me and you, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:2; 13:16; 15:5; 18:18">⚓</a>will multiply you exceedingly.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying: </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_4"><sup>4</sup>“As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 4:11, 12, 16)">⚓</a>father of many nations. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_5"><sup>5</sup>No longer shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:7">⚓</a>your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 4:17">⚓</a>for I have made you a father of many nations. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_6"><sup>6</sup>I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:16; 35:11">⚓</a>of you, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:6">⚓</a>kings shall come from you. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_7"><sup>7</sup>And I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gal. 3:17)">⚓</a>establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:24; 28:13; Lev. 11:45; 26:12, 45; Heb. 11:16">⚓</a>to be God to you and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 9:8; Gal. 3:16">⚓</a>your descendants after you. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_8"><sup>8</sup>Also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:7; 13:15, 17; Acts 7:5">⚓</a>I give to you and your descendants after you the land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 23:4; 28:4">⚓</a>in which you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:7; 29:45; Lev. 26:12; Deut. 29:13; Rev. 21:7">⚓</a>I will be their God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_17_9"> <sup>9</sup>And God said to Abraham: “As for you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:5">⚓</a>you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_10"><sup>10</sup>This <i>is</i> My covenant which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:22; Acts 7:8">⚓</a>Every male child among you shall be circumcised; </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_11"><sup>11</sup>and you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:13, 48; (Rom. 4:11)">⚓</a>a sign of the covenant between Me and you. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_12"><sup>12</sup>He who is eight days old among you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 12:3">⚓</a>shall be circumcised, every male child in your generations, he who is born in your house or bought with money from any foreigner who is not your descendant. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_13"><sup>13</sup>He who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money must be circumcised, and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_14"><sup>14</sup>And the uncircumcised male child, who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:24–26">⚓</a>shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_17_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> her name. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_16"><sup>16</sup>And I will bless her and also give you a son by her; then I will bless her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:10">⚓</a>and she shall be <i>a</i> <i>mother</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:11; Gal. 4:31; 1 Pet. 3:6">⚓</a>of nations; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:6; 36:31; 1 Sam. 8:22">⚓</a>kings of peoples shall be from her.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_17_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Abraham fell on his face <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:3; 18:12; 21:6">⚓</a>and laughed, and said in his heart, “Shall <i>a</i> <i>child</i> be born to a man who is one hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear <i>a</i> <i>child?</i>” </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_18"><sup>18</sup>And Abraham <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:23">⚓</a>said to God, “Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_17_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then God said: “No, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:10; 21:2; (Gal. 4:28)">⚓</a>Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; I will establish My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:16; Matt. 1:2; Luke 3:34">⚓</a>covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, <i>and</i> with his descendants after him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_20"><sup>20</sup>And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:10">⚓</a>will multiply him exceedingly. He shall beget <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:12–16">⚓</a>twelve princes, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:13, 18">⚓</a>and I will make him a great nation. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_21"><sup>21</sup>But My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:2–5">⚓</a>covenant I will establish with Isaac, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:2">⚓</a>whom Sarah shall bear to you at this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:14">⚓</a>set time next year.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_22"><sup>22</sup>Then He finished talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_17_23"> <sup>23</sup>So Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very same day, as God had said to him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_24"><sup>24</sup>Abraham <i>was</i> ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_25"><sup>25</sup>And Ishmael his son <i>was</i> thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_26"><sup>26</sup>That very same day Abraham was circumcised, and his son Ishmael; </span>
<span class="verse sa_17_27"><sup>27</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:19">⚓</a>all the men of his house, born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.<br/></span>
