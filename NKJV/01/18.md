<span class="verse sa_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the Lord appeared to him by the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:18; 14:13">⚓</a>terebinth trees of Mamre, as he was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day. </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:16, 22; 32:24; Josh. 5:13; Judg. 13:6–11; Heb. 13:2">⚓</a>So he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing by him; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:1; 1 Pet. 4:9">⚓</a>and when he saw <i>them,</i> he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the ground, </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_3"><sup>3</sup>and said, “My Lord, if I have now found favor in Your sight, do not pass on by Your servant. </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_4"><sup>4</sup>Please let <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:2; 24:32; 43:24">⚓</a>a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_5"><sup>5</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:18, 19; 13:15, 16">⚓</a>I will bring a morsel of bread, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:5; Ps. 104:15">⚓</a>you may refresh your hearts. After that you may pass by, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:8; 33:10">⚓</a>inasmuch as you have come to your servant.”<br/> They said, “Do as you have said.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_18_6"> <sup>6</sup>So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quickly, make ready three measures of fine meal; knead <i>it</i> and make cakes.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_7"><sup>7</sup>And Abraham ran to the herd, took a tender and good calf, gave <i>it</i> to a young man, and he hastened to prepare it. </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_8"><sup>8</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:3">⚓</a>he took butter and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set <i>it</i> before them; and he stood by them under the tree as they ate.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_18_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then they said to him, “Where <i>is</i> Sarah your wife?”<br/> So he said, “Here, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:67">⚓</a>in the tent.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_18_10"> <sup>10</sup>And He said, “I will certainly return to you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:16">⚓</a>according to the time of life, and behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:19, 21; 21:2; Rom. 9:9">⚓</a>Sarah your wife shall have a son.”<br/> (Sarah was listening in the tent door which <i>was</i> behind him.) </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_11"><sup>11</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:17; Luke 1:18; Rom. 4:19; Heb. 11:11, 12, 19">⚓</a>Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age; <i>and</i> Sarah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:35">⚓</a>had passed the age of childbearing. </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_12"><sup>12</sup>Therefore Sarah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:17">⚓</a>laughed within herself, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:18">⚓</a>“After I have grown old, shall I have pleasure, my <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Pet. 3:6">⚓</a>lord being old also?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_18_13"> <sup>13</sup>And the Lord said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘Shall I surely bear <i>a</i> <i>child,</i> since I am old?’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:23; Jer. 32:17; Zech. 8:6; Matt. 3:9; 19:26; Luke 1:37; Rom. 4:21">⚓</a>Is anything too hard for the Lord? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:21; 18:10; 2 Kin. 4:16">⚓</a>At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_18_15"> <sup>15</sup>But Sarah denied <i>it,</i> saying, “I did not laugh,” for she was afraid.<br/> And He said, “No, but you did laugh!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Abraham Intercedes for Sodom</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_18_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then the men rose from there and looked toward Sodom, and Abraham went with them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:3; Rom. 15:24">⚓</a>to send them on the way. </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_17"><sup>17</sup>And the Lord said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:22, 26, 33; Ps. 25:14; Amos 3:7; (John 15:15)">⚓</a>“Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing, </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_18"><sup>18</sup>since Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 12:3; 22:18); Matt. 1:1; Luke 3:34; (Acts 3:25, 26; Gal. 3:8)">⚓</a>blessed in him? </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_19"><sup>19</sup>For I have known him, in order <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 4:9, 10; 6:6, 7)">⚓</a>that he may command his children and his household after him, that they keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice, that the Lord may bring to Abraham what He has spoken to him.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_20"><sup>20</sup>And the Lord said, “Because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:10; 19:13; Ezek. 16:49, 50">⚓</a>the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:13">⚓</a>sin is very grave, </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 11:5; Ex. 3:8; Ps. 14:2">⚓</a>I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry against it that has come to Me; and if not, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:2; 13:3; Josh. 22:22; Luke 16:15; 2 Cor. 11:11">⚓</a>I will know.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_18_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then the men turned away from there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:16; 19:1">⚓</a>and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_23"><sup>23</sup>And Abraham <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 10:22)">⚓</a>came near and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:7; Num. 16:22; 2 Sam. 24:17; Ps. 11:4–7">⚓</a>“Would You also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 9:22">⚓</a>destroy the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:4">⚓</a>righteous with the wicked? </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_24"><sup>24</sup>Suppose there were fifty righteous within the city; would You also destroy the place and not spare <i>it</i> for the fifty righteous that were in it? </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_25"><sup>25</sup>Far be it from You to do such a thing as this, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 8:20; Is. 3:10, 11">⚓</a>the righteous should be as the wicked; far be it from You! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:16, 17; 32:4; Job 8:3, 20; 34:17; Ps. 58:11; 94:2; Is. 3:10, 11; Rom. 3:5, 6">⚓</a>Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_18_26"> <sup>26</sup>So the Lord said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 5:1; Ezek. 22:30">⚓</a>“If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_18_27"> <sup>27</sup>Then Abraham answered and said, “Indeed now, I who <i>am</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 3:19); Job 4:19; 30:19; 42:6; (1 Cor. 15:47, 48)">⚓</a>but dust and ashes have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_28"><sup>28</sup>Suppose there were five less than the fifty righteous; would You destroy all of the city for <i>lack</i> <i>of</i> five?”<br/> So He said, “If I find there forty-five, I will not destroy <i>it.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_18_29"> <sup>29</sup>And he spoke to Him yet again and said, “Suppose there should be forty found there?”<br/> So He said, “I will not do <i>it</i> for the sake of forty.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_18_30"> <sup>30</sup>Then he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:39">⚓</a>“Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Suppose thirty should be found there?”<br/> So He said, “I will not do <i>it</i> if I find thirty there.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_18_31"> <sup>31</sup>And he said, “Indeed now, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord: Suppose twenty should be found there?”<br/> So He said, “I will not destroy <i>it</i> for the sake of twenty.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_18_32"> <sup>32</sup>Then he said, “Let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak but once more: Suppose ten should be found there?”<br/> <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="James 5:16">⚓</a>And He said, “I will not destroy <i>it</i> for the sake of ten.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_18_33"><sup>33</sup>So the Lord went His way as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.<br/></span>
