<div class="title"><h1>19</h1><h3>Sodom’s Depravity</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:2, 16, 22">⚓</a>the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:1–5">⚓</a>Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw <i>them,</i> he rose to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_2"><sup>2</sup>And he said, “Here now, my lords, please <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:31; (Heb. 13:2)">⚓</a>turn in to your servant’s house and spend the night, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:4; 24:32">⚓</a>wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way.”<br/> And they said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:28">⚓</a>“No, but we will spend the night in the open square.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_19_3"> <sup>3</sup>But he insisted strongly; so they turned in to him and entered his house. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:6–8; Ex. 23:15; Num. 9:11; 28:17">⚓</a>Then he made them a feast, and baked <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:8">⚓</a>unleavened bread, and they ate.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_19_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both old and young, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 3:9">⚓</a>And they called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:22">⚓</a>Bring them out to us that we <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:1; Rom. 1:24, 27; Jude 7">⚓</a>may know them <i>carnally.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_19_6"> <sup>6</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:23">⚓</a>Lot went out to them through the doorway, shut the door behind him, </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_7"><sup>7</sup>and said, “Please, my brethren, do not do so wickedly! </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:24">⚓</a>See now, I have two daughters who have not known a man; please, let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them as you wish; only do nothing to these men, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:5">⚓</a>since this is the reason they have come under the shadow of my roof.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_19_9"> <sup>9</sup>And they said, “Stand back!” Then they said, “This one <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 2:7, 8">⚓</a>came in to stay <i>here,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:14">⚓</a>and he keeps acting as a judge; now we will deal worse with you than with them.” So they pressed hard against the man Lot, and came near to break down the door. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_10"><sup>10</sup>But the men reached out their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_11"><sup>11</sup>And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:17, 18">⚓</a>struck the men who <i>were</i> at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they became weary <i>trying</i> to find the door.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Sodom and Gomorrah Destroyed</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_19_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then the men said to Lot, “Have you anyone else here? Son-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever you have in the city—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 7:1; 2 Pet. 2:7, 9">⚓</a>take <i>them</i> out of this place! </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_13"><sup>13</sup>For we will destroy this place, because the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:20">⚓</a>outcry against them has grown great before the face of the Lord, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:30–33; Deut. 4:26; 28:45; 1 Chr. 21:15">⚓</a>the Lord has sent us to destroy it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_19_14"> <sup>14</sup>So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:18">⚓</a>who had married his daughters, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:21, 24, 26, 45; Rev. 18:4">⚓</a>“Get up, get out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city!” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:21; Jer. 43:1, 2; Luke 17:28; 24:11">⚓</a>But to his sons-in-law he seemed to be joking.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_19_15"> <sup>15</sup>When the morning dawned, the angels urged Lot to hurry, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 37:2; Rev. 18:4">⚓</a>“Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the punishment of the city.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_16"><sup>16</sup>And while he lingered, the men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 5:15; 6:21; 7:8; 2 Pet. 2:7">⚓</a>took hold of his hand, his wife’s hand, and the hands of his two daughters, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:7; Ps. 32:10; 33:18, 19; Luke 18:13">⚓</a>Lord being merciful to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 34:22">⚓</a>and they brought him out and set him outside the city. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_17"><sup>17</sup>So it came to pass, when they had brought them outside, that he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:3; Jer. 48:6">⚓</a>“Escape for your life! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:26; Matt. 24:16–18; Luke 9:62; Phil. 3:13, 14">⚓</a>Do not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:10">⚓</a>to the mountains, lest you be destroyed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_19_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then Lot said to them, “Please, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:14">⚓</a>no, my lords! </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_19"><sup>19</sup>Indeed now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have increased your mercy which you have shown me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, lest some evil overtake me and I die. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_20"><sup>20</sup>See now, this city <i>is</i> near <i>enough</i> to flee to, and it <i>is</i> a little one; please let me escape there (<i>is</i> it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_19_21"> <sup>21</sup>And he said to him, “See, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 42:8, 9; Ps. 145:19">⚓</a>I have favored you concerning this thing also, in that I will not overthrow this city for which you have spoken. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_22"><sup>22</sup>Hurry, escape there. For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:10; Deut. 9:14">⚓</a>I cannot do anything until you arrive there.”<br/> Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:10; 14:2">⚓</a>the name of the city was called Zoar.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_19_23"> <sup>23</sup>The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered Zoar. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_24"><sup>24</sup>Then the Lord rained <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:23; Ps. 11:6; Is. 13:19; Jer. 20:16; 23:14; 49:18; 50:40; Ezek. 16:49, 50; Hos. 11:8; Amos 4:11; Zeph. 2:9; Matt. 10:15; Mark 6:11; Luke 17:29; Rom. 9:29; 2 Pet. 2:6; Jude 7; Rev. 11:8">⚓</a>brimstone and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 10:2">⚓</a>fire on Sodom and Gomorrah, from the Lord out of the heavens. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_25"><sup>25</sup>So He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 107:34">⚓</a>what grew on the ground.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_19_26"> <sup>26</sup>But his wife looked back behind him, and she became <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:17; Luke 17:32">⚓</a>a pillar of salt.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_19_27"> <sup>27</sup>And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:22">⚓</a>he had stood before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_28"><sup>28</sup>Then he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain; and he saw, and behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 9:2; 18:9">⚓</a>the smoke of the land which went up like the smoke of a furnace. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_29"><sup>29</sup>And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 8:1; 18:23; Deut. 7:8; 9:5, 27">⚓</a>remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot had dwelt.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Descendants of Lot</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_19_30"> <sup>30</sup>Then Lot went up out of Zoar and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:17, 19">⚓</a>dwelt in the mountains, and his two daughters were with him; for he was afraid to dwell in Zoar. And he and his two daughters dwelt in a cave. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_31"><sup>31</sup>Now the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father <i>is</i> old, and <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no man on the earth <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:2, 4; 38:8, 9; Deut. 25:5">⚓</a>to come in to us as is the custom of all the earth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_32"><sup>32</sup>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mark 12:19)">⚓</a>may preserve the lineage of our father.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_33"><sup>33</sup>So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_19_34"> <sup>34</sup>It happened on the next day that the firstborn said to the younger, “Indeed I lay with my father last night; let us make him drink wine tonight also, and you go in <i>and</i> lie with him, that we may preserve the lineage of our father.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_35"><sup>35</sup>Then they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_19_36"> <sup>36</sup>Thus both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_37"><sup>37</sup>The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 25:1; Deut. 2:9">⚓</a>he <i>is</i> the father of the Moabites to this day. </span>
<span class="verse sa_19_38"><sup>38</sup>And the younger, she also bore a son and called his name Ben-Ammi; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:24; Deut. 2:19">⚓</a>he <i>is</i> the father of the people of Ammon to this day.<br/></span>
