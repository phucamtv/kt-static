<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>Abraham and Abimelech</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>And Abraham journeyed from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:1">⚓</a>there to the South, and dwelt between <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:9; 16:7, 14">⚓</a>Kadesh and Shur, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:1, 6">⚓</a>stayed in Gerar. </span>
<span class="verse sa_20_2"><sup>2</sup>Now Abraham said of Sarah his wife, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:11–13; 26:7">⚓</a>“She <i>is</i> my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:15">⚓</a>took Sarah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_20_3"> <sup>3</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:14">⚓</a>God came to Abimelech <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 33:15">⚓</a>in a dream by night, and said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:7">⚓</a>“Indeed you <i>are</i> a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she <i>is</i> a man’s wife.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_20_4"> <sup>4</sup>But Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, “Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:23–25; Num. 16:22">⚓</a>will You slay a righteous nation also? </span>
<span class="verse sa_20_5"><sup>5</sup>Did he not say to me, ‘She <i>is</i> my sister’? And she, even she herself said, ‘He <i>is</i> my brother.’ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:4; 2 Kin. 20:3; Ps. 7:8; 26:6">⚓</a>In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_20_6"> <sup>6</sup>And God said to him in a dream, “Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart. For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:7; 35:5; Ex. 34:24; 1 Sam. 25:26, 34">⚓</a>I also withheld you from sinning <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:9; 2 Sam. 12:13">⚓</a>against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her. </span>
<span class="verse sa_20_7"><sup>7</sup>Now therefore, restore the man’s wife; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:5; 2 Kin. 5:11; Job 42:8; James 5:14, 15">⚓</a>for he <i>is</i> a prophet, and he will pray for you and you shall live. But if you do not restore <i>her,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:17">⚓</a>know that you shall surely die, you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:32, 33">⚓</a>and all who <i>are</i> yours.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_20_8"> <sup>8</sup>So Abimelech rose early in the morning, called all his servants, and told all these things in their hearing; and the men were very much afraid. </span>
<span class="verse sa_20_9"><sup>9</sup>And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I offended you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:10; 39:9; Ex. 32:21; Josh. 7:25">⚓</a>that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:7">⚓</a>that ought not to be done.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_20_10"><sup>10</sup>Then Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you have in view, that you have done this thing?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_20_11"> <sup>11</sup>And Abraham said, “Because I thought, surely <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:18; Neh. 5:15; Ps. 36:1; Prov. 16:6">⚓</a>the fear of God <i>is</i> not in this place; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:12; 26:7">⚓</a>they will kill me on account of my wife. </span>
<span class="verse sa_20_12"><sup>12</sup>But indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 11:29">⚓</a><i>she</i> <i>is</i> truly my sister. She <i>is</i> the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. </span>
<span class="verse sa_20_13"><sup>13</sup>And it came to pass, when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:1–9, 11; (Heb. 11:8)">⚓</a>God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said to her, ‘This <i>is</i> your kindness that you should do for me: in every place, wherever we go, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:13; 20:5">⚓</a>say of me, “He <i>is</i> my brother.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_20_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then Abimelech <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:16">⚓</a>took sheep, oxen, and male and female servants, and gave <i>them</i> to Abraham; and he restored Sarah his wife to him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_20_15"><sup>15</sup>And Abimelech said, “See, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:9; 34:10; 47:6">⚓</a>my land <i>is</i> before you; dwell where it pleases you.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_20_16"><sup>16</sup>Then to Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand <i>pieces</i> of silver; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:11">⚓</a>indeed this vindicates you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 2:9">⚓</a>before all who <i>are</i> with you and before everybody.” Thus she was rebuked.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_20_17"> <sup>17</sup>So Abraham prayed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:13; 21:7; Job 42:9; (James 5:16)">⚓</a>to God; and God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:2">⚓</a>healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants. Then they bore <i>children;</i></span>
<span class="verse sa_20_18"><sup>18</sup>for the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:17">⚓</a>had closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.<br/></span>
