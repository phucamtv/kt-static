<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>Isaac Is Born</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>And the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:21">⚓</a>visited Sarah as He had said, and the Lord did for Sarah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:16, 19, 21; 18:10, 14; (Gal. 4:23, 28)">⚓</a>as He had spoken. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_2"><sup>2</sup>For Sarah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:8; Gal. 4:22; Heb. 11:11, 12">⚓</a>conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:21; 18:10, 14; Gal. 4:4">⚓</a>at the set time of which God had spoken to him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_3"><sup>3</sup>And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him—whom Sarah bore to him—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:19, 21">⚓</a>Isaac. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_4"><sup>4</sup>Then Abraham <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:8">⚓</a>circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:10, 12; Lev. 12:3">⚓</a>as God had commanded him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_5"><sup>5</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:1, 17">⚓</a>Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_6"><sup>6</sup>And Sarah said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:13; Ps. 126:2; Is. 54:1">⚓</a>“God has made me laugh, <i>and</i> all who hear <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:58">⚓</a>will laugh with me.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_7"><sup>7</sup>She also said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:11, 12">⚓</a>For I have borne <i>him</i> a son in his old age.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Hagar and Ishmael Depart</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_21_8"> <sup>8</sup>So the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the same day that Isaac was weaned.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_21_9"> <sup>9</sup>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:1, 4, 15">⚓</a>the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gal. 4:29)">⚓</a>scoffing. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_10"><sup>10</sup>Therefore she said to Abraham, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:6; 36:6, 7; Gal. 3:18; 4:30">⚓</a>“Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, <i>namely</i> with Isaac.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_11"><sup>11</sup>And the matter was very displeasing in Abraham’s sight <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:18">⚓</a>because of his son.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_21_12"> <sup>12</sup>But God said to Abraham, “Do not let it be displeasing in your sight because of the lad or because of your bondwoman. Whatever Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:2; Luke 3:34; (Rom. 9:7, 8); Heb. 11:18">⚓</a>in Isaac your seed shall be called. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_13"><sup>13</sup>Yet I will also make <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:10; 17:20; 21:18; 25:12–18">⚓</a>a nation of the son of the bondwoman, because he <i>is</i> your seed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_21_14"> <sup>14</sup>So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water; and putting <i>it</i> on her shoulder, he gave <i>it</i> and the boy to Hagar, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:35">⚓</a>sent her away. Then she departed and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_15"><sup>15</sup>And the water in the skin was used up, and she placed the boy under one of the shrubs. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_16"><sup>16</sup>Then she went and sat down across from <i>him</i> at a distance of about a bowshot; for she said to herself, “Let me not see the death of the boy.” So she sat opposite <i>him,</i> and lifted her voice and wept.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_21_17"> <sup>17</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:7; Deut. 26:7; Ps. 6:8">⚓</a>God heard the voice of the lad. Then the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:11">⚓</a>angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, “What ails you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he <i>is.</i></span>
<span class="verse sa_21_18"><sup>18</sup>Arise, lift up the lad and hold him with your hand, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:10; 21:13; 25:12–16">⚓</a>I will make him a great nation.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_21_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:7; Num. 22:31; 2 Kin. 6:17; Luke 24:31">⚓</a>God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad a drink. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_20"><sup>20</sup>So God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:15; 39:2, 3, 21">⚓</a>was with the lad; and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:12">⚓</a>and became an archer. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_21"><sup>21</sup>He dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran; and his mother <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:4">⚓</a>took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Covenant with Abimelech</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_21_22"> <sup>22</sup>And it came to pass at that time that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:2, 14; 26:26">⚓</a>Abimelech and Phichol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:28; Is. 8:10">⚓</a>“God <i>is</i> with you in all that you do. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_23"><sup>23</sup>Now therefore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:12; 1 Sam. 24:21">⚓</a>swear to me by God that you will not deal falsely with me, with my offspring, or with my posterity; but that according to the kindness that I have done to you, you will do to me and to the land in which you have dwelt.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_21_24"> <sup>24</sup>And Abraham said, “I will swear.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_21_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Abraham rebuked Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech’s servants <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:15, 18, 20–22">⚓</a>had seized. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_26"><sup>26</sup>And Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, nor had I heard <i>of</i> <i>it</i> until today.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_27"><sup>27</sup>So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:31; 31:44; 1 Sam. 18:3">⚓</a>made a covenant. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_28"><sup>28</sup>And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_21_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then Abimelech asked Abraham, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:8">⚓</a>“What <i>is</i> <i>the</i> <i>meaning</i> <i>of</i> these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_21_30"> <sup>30</sup>And he said, “You will take <i>these</i> seven ewe lambs from my hand, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:48, 52">⚓</a>they may be my witness that I have dug this well.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_31"><sup>31</sup>Therefore he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:14; 26:33">⚓</a>called that place Beersheba, because the two of them swore an oath there.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_21_32"> <sup>32</sup>Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba. So Abimelech rose with Phichol, the commander of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_33"><sup>33</sup>Then <i>Abraham</i> planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:26; 12:8; 13:4; 26:25">⚓</a>there called on the name of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:11; Ex. 15:18; Deut. 32:40; 33:27; Ps. 90:2; 93:2; Is. 40:28; Jer. 10:10; Hab. 1:12; Heb. 13:8">⚓</a>the Everlasting God. </span>
<span class="verse sa_21_34"><sup>34</sup>And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines many days.<br/></span>
