<div class="title"><h1>22</h1><h3>Abraham’s Faith Confirmed</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_22_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass after these things that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:2, 16; 1 Cor. 10:13; Heb. 11:17; (James 1:12–14; 1 Pet. 1:7)">⚓</a>God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!”<br/> And he said, “Here I am.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_22_2"> <sup>2</sup>Then He said, “Take now your son, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:12, 16; John 3:16; Heb. 11:17; 1 John 4:9">⚓</a>your only <i>son</i> Isaac, whom you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 5:20">⚓</a>love, and go <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 3:1">⚓</a>to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 8:20; 31:54">⚓</a>burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_22_3"> <sup>3</sup>So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_22_4"><sup>4</sup>Then on the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place afar off. </span>
<span class="verse sa_22_5"><sup>5</sup>And Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; the lad and I will go yonder and worship, and we will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 11:19)">⚓</a>come back to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_22_6"> <sup>6</sup>So Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 19:17">⚓</a>laid <i>it</i> on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together. </span>
<span class="verse sa_22_7"><sup>7</sup>But Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!”<br/> And he said, “Here I am, my son.”<br/> Then he said, “Look, the fire and the wood, but where <i>is</i> the lamb for a burnt offering?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_22_8"> <sup>8</sup>And Abraham said, “My son, God will provide for Himself the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:29, 36">⚓</a>lamb for a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:3–6">⚓</a>burnt offering.” So the two of them went together.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_22_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 11:17–19; James 2:21)">⚓</a>laid him on the altar, upon the wood. </span>
<span class="verse sa_22_10"><sup>10</sup>And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_22_11"> <sup>11</sup>But the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:7–11; 21:17, 18; 31:11">⚓</a>Angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!”<br/> So he said, “Here I am.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_22_12"> <sup>12</sup>And He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:22">⚓</a>“Do not lay your hand on the lad, or do anything to him; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:5; James 2:21, 22">⚓</a>now I know that you fear God, since you have not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:2, 16; John 3:16">⚓</a>withheld your son, your only <i>son,</i> from Me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_22_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then Abraham lifted his eyes and looked, and there behind <i>him</i> <i>was</i> a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son. </span>
<span class="verse sa_22_14"><sup>14</sup>And Abraham called the name of the place, The-Lord-Will-Provide; as it is said <i>to</i> this day, “In the Mount of the Lord it shall be provided.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_22_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then the Angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time out of heaven, </span>
<span class="verse sa_22_16"><sup>16</sup>and said: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:9; Luke 1:73; (Heb. 6:13, 14)">⚓</a>“By Myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only <i>son</i>—</span>
<span class="verse sa_22_17"><sup>17</sup>blessing I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:16; 26:3, 24">⚓</a>bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your descendants <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:5; 26:4; Deut. 1:10; Jer. 33:22; Heb. 11:12">⚓</a>as the stars of the heaven <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:16; 32:12; 1 Kin. 4:20">⚓</a>and as the sand which <i>is</i> on the seashore; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:60">⚓</a>your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies. </span>
<span class="verse sa_22_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:3; 18:18; 26:4; Matt. 1:1; Luke 3:34; (Acts 3:25, 26); Gal. 3:8, 9, 16, 18">⚓</a>In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:19; 22:3, 10; 26:5">⚓</a>because you have obeyed My voice.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_22_19"><sup>19</sup>So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:31">⚓</a>Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Family of Nahor</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_22_20"> <sup>20</sup>Now it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham, saying, “Indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 11:29; 24:15">⚓</a>Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor: </span>
<span class="verse sa_22_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:1">⚓</a>Huz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 32:2">⚓</a>of Aram, </span>
<span class="verse sa_22_22"><sup>22</sup>Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_22_23"><sup>23</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:15">⚓</a>Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother. </span>
<span class="verse sa_22_24"><sup>24</sup>His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.<br/></span>
