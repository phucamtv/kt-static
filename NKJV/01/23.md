<div class="title"><h1>23</h1><h3>Sarah’s Death and Burial</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_23_1"> <sup>1</sup>Sarah lived one hundred and twenty-seven years; <i>these</i> <i>were</i> the years of the life of Sarah. </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_2"><sup>2</sup>So Sarah died in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:27; Josh. 14:15; 15:13; 21:11">⚓</a>Kirjath Arba (that <i>is,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:18; 23:19">⚓</a>Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 10:15; 15:20; 2 Kin. 7:6">⚓</a>Heth, saying, </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 17:8); Lev. 25:23; 1 Chr. 29:15; Ps. 39:12; 105:12; 119:19; (Heb. 11:9, 13)">⚓</a>“I <i>am</i> a foreigner and a visitor among you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:5, 16">⚓</a>Give me property for a burial place among you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_5"> <sup>5</sup>And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_6"><sup>6</sup>“Hear us, my lord: You <i>are</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:2; 14:14; 24:35">⚓</a>a mighty prince among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places. None of us will withhold from you his burial place, that you may bury your dead.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, the sons of Heth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_8"><sup>8</sup>And he spoke with them, saying, “If it is your wish that I bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and meet with Ephron the son of Zohar for me, </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_9"><sup>9</sup>that he may give me the cave of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:9">⚓</a>Machpelah which he has, which <i>is</i> at the end of his field. Let him give it to me at the full price, as property for a burial place among you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now Ephron dwelt among the sons of Heth; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the presence of the sons of Heth, all who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 23:18; 34:20, 24; Ruth 4:1, 4, 11">⚓</a>entered at the gate of his city, saying, </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:21–24">⚓</a>“No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field and the cave that <i>is</i> in it; I give it to you in the presence of the sons of my people. I give it to you. Bury your dead!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land; </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_13"><sup>13</sup>and he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, “If you <i>will</i> <i>give</i> <i>it,</i> please hear me. I will give you money for the field; take <i>it</i> from me and I will bury my dead there.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_14"> <sup>14</sup>And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_15"><sup>15</sup>“My lord, listen to me; the land <i>is</i> <i>worth</i> four hundred <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:13; Ezek. 45:12">⚓</a>shekels of silver. What <i>is</i> that between you and me? So bury your dead.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_16"><sup>16</sup>And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 14:26; Jer. 32:9, 10; Zech. 11:12">⚓</a>weighed out the silver for Ephron which he had named in the hearing of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, currency of the merchants.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_17"> <sup>17</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:9; 49:29–32; 50:13; Acts 7:16">⚓</a>the field of Ephron which <i>was</i> in Machpelah, which <i>was</i> before Mamre, the field and the cave which <i>was</i> in it, and all the trees that <i>were</i> in the field, which <i>were</i> within all the surrounding borders, were deeded </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_18"><sup>18</sup>to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_23_19"> <sup>19</sup>And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre (that <i>is,</i> Hebron) in the land of Canaan. </span>
<span class="verse sa_23_20"><sup>20</sup>So the field and the cave that <i>is</i> in it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 32:10, 11">⚓</a>were deeded to Abraham by the sons of Heth as property for a burial place.<br/></span>
