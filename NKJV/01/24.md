<div class="title"><h1>24</h1><h3>A Bride for Isaac</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_24_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Abraham <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:11; 21:5">⚓</a>was old, well advanced in age; and the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:2; 13:2; 24:35; Ps. 112:3; Prov. 10:22; (Gal. 3:9)">⚓</a>had blessed Abraham in all things. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_2"><sup>2</sup>So Abraham said <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:2">⚓</a>to the oldest servant of his house, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:10; 39:4–6">⚓</a>ruled over all that he had, “Please, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:29; 1 Chr. 29:24">⚓</a>put your hand under my thigh, </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_3"><sup>3</sup>and I will make you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:19, 22">⚓</a>swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:35; 28:2; Ex. 34:16; Deut. 7:3; 2 Cor. 6:14–17">⚓</a>you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell; </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:2">⚓</a>but you shall go <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:1; Heb. 11:15">⚓</a>to my country and to my family, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_5"> <sup>5</sup>And the servant said to him, “Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I take your son back to the land from which you came?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_6"> <sup>6</sup>But Abraham said to him, “Beware that you do not take my son back there. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_7"><sup>7</sup>The Lord God of heaven, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:1; 24:3">⚓</a>took me from my father’s house and from the land of my family, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 15:18; 17:8; Ex. 32:13; Deut. 1:8; 34:4; Acts 7:5">⚓</a>‘To your descendants I give this land,’ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:7; 21:17; 22:11; Ex. 23:20, 23; 33:2; Heb. 1:4, 14">⚓</a>He will send His angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_8"><sup>8</sup>And if the woman is not willing to follow you, then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:17–20">⚓</a>you will be released from this oath; only do not take my son back there.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_9"><sup>9</sup>So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:2, 22">⚓</a>for all his master’s goods <i>were</i> <i>in</i> his hand. And he arose and went to Mesopotamia, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 11:31, 32; 22:20; 27:43; 29:5">⚓</a>the city of Nahor. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_11"><sup>11</sup>And he made his camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water at evening time, the time <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:16; 1 Sam. 9:11">⚓</a>when women go out to draw <i>water.</i></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_12"><sup>12</sup>Then he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:27, 42, 48; 26:24; 32:9; Ex. 3:6, 15">⚓</a>said, “O Lord God of my master Abraham, please <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:20; Neh. 1:11; Ps. 37:5">⚓</a>give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_13"><sup>13</sup>Behold, <i>here</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:43">⚓</a>I stand by the well of water, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:16">⚓</a>the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_14"><sup>14</sup>Now let it be that the young woman to whom I say, ‘Please let down your pitcher that I may drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink’—<i>let</i> her <i>be</i> <i>the</i> <i>one</i> You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:17, 37; 1 Sam. 14:10; 16:7; 20:7; 2 Kin. 20:9; Prov. 16:33; Acts 1:26">⚓</a>by this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_15"> <sup>15</sup>And it happened, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 65:24">⚓</a>before he had finished speaking, that behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:45; 25:20">⚓</a>Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel, son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:20, 23">⚓</a>Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_16"><sup>16</sup>Now the young woman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:11; 26:7; 29:17">⚓</a><i>was</i> very beautiful to behold, a virgin; no man had known her. And she went down to the well, filled her pitcher, and came up. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_17"><sup>17</sup>And the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your pitcher.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:14, 46; (1 Pet. 3:8, 9)">⚓</a>So she said, “Drink, my lord.” Then she quickly let her pitcher down to her hand, and gave him a drink. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_19"><sup>19</sup>And when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will draw <i>water</i> for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_20"><sup>20</sup>Then she quickly emptied her pitcher into the trough, ran back to the well to draw <i>water,</i> and drew for all his camels. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_21"><sup>21</sup>And the man, wondering at her, remained silent so as to know whether <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:12–14, 27, 52">⚓</a>the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_22"> <sup>22</sup>So it was, when the camels had finished drinking, that the man took a golden <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:47; Ex. 32:2, 3; Is. 3:19–21">⚓</a>nose ring weighing half a shekel, and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten <i>shekels</i> of gold, </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_23"><sup>23</sup>and said, “Whose daughter <i>are</i> you? Tell me, please, is there room <i>in</i> your father’s house for us to lodge?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_24"> <sup>24</sup>So she said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:23; 24:15">⚓</a>“I <i>am</i> the daughter of Bethuel, Milcah’s son, whom she bore to Nahor.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_25"><sup>25</sup>Moreover she said to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then the man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:48, 52; Ex. 4:31">⚓</a>bowed down his head and worshiped the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_27"><sup>27</sup>And he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:12, 42, 48; Ex. 18:10; Ruth 4:14; 1 Sam. 25:32, 39; 2 Sam. 18:28; Luke 1:68">⚓</a>“Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:10; Ps. 98:3">⚓</a>His mercy and His truth toward my master. As for me, being on the way, the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:21, 48">⚓</a>led me to the house of my master’s brethren.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_28"><sup>28</sup>So the young woman ran and told her mother’s household these things.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_29"> <sup>29</sup>Now Rebekah had a brother whose name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:5, 13">⚓</a>Laban, and Laban ran out to the man by the well. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_30"><sup>30</sup>So it came to pass, when he saw the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, saying, “Thus the man spoke to me,” that he went to the man. And there he stood by the camels at the well. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_31"><sup>31</sup>And he said, “Come in, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:29; Judg. 17:2; Ruth 3:10; Ps. 115:15">⚓</a>O blessed of the Lord! Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_32"> <sup>32</sup>Then the man came to the house. And he unloaded the camels, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:24; Judg. 19:21">⚓</a>provided straw and feed for the camels, and water to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:2; John 13:5, 13–15">⚓</a>wash his feet and the feet of the men who <i>were</i> with him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_33"><sup>33</sup><i>Food</i> was set before him to eat, but he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 23:12; John 4:34; Eph. 6:5–7">⚓</a>“I will not eat until I have told about my errand.”<br/> And he said, “Speak on.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_34"> <sup>34</sup>So he said, “I <i>am</i> Abraham’s servant. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_35"><sup>35</sup>The Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:2; 24:1">⚓</a>has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great; and He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_36"><sup>36</sup>And Sarah my master’s wife <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:1–7">⚓</a>bore a son to my master when she was old; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:10; 25:5">⚓</a>to him he has given all that he has. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_37"><sup>37</sup>Now my master <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:2–4">⚓</a>made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell; </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_38"><sup>38</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:4">⚓</a>but you shall go to my father’s house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_39"><sup>39</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:5">⚓</a>And I said to my master, ‘Perhaps the woman will not follow me.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_40"><sup>40</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:7">⚓</a>But he said to me, ‘The Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 5:22, 24; 17:1; 1 Kin. 8:23">⚓</a>before whom I walk, will send His angel with you and prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son from my family and from my father’s house. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_41"><sup>41</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:8">⚓</a>You will be clear from this oath when you arrive among my family; for if they will not give <i>her</i> to you, then you will be released from my oath.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_42"> <sup>42</sup>“And this day I came to the well and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:12">⚓</a>‘O Lord God of my master Abraham, if You will now prosper the way in which I go, </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_43"><sup>43</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:13">⚓</a>behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass that when the virgin comes out to draw <i>water,</i> and I say to her, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,” </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_44"><sup>44</sup>and she says to me, “Drink, and I will draw for your camels also,”—<i>let</i> her <i>be</i> the woman whom the Lord has appointed for my master’s son.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_45"> <sup>45</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:15">⚓</a>“But before I had finished <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:13">⚓</a>speaking in my heart, there was Rebekah, coming out with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well and drew <i>water.</i> And I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_46"><sup>46</sup>And she made haste and let her pitcher down from her <i>shoulder,</i> and said, ‘Drink, and I will give your camels a drink also.’ So I drank, and she gave the camels a drink also. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_47"><sup>47</sup>Then I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter <i>are</i> you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the nose ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_48"><sup>48</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:26, 52">⚓</a>And I bowed my head and worshiped the Lord, and blessed the Lord God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the way of truth to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:23; 24:27; Ps. 32:8; 48:14; Is. 48:17">⚓</a>take the daughter of my master’s brother for his son. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_49"><sup>49</sup>Now if you will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:29; Josh. 2:14">⚓</a>deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_50"> <sup>50</sup>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 118:23; Matt. 21:42; Mark 12:11">⚓</a>“The thing comes from the Lord; we cannot <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:24, 29">⚓</a>speak to you either bad or good. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_51"><sup>51</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:15">⚓</a>Here <i>is</i> Rebekah before you; take <i>her</i> and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as the Lord has spoken.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_52"> <sup>52</sup>And it came to pass, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:26, 48">⚓</a>he worshiped the Lord, <i>bowing</i> <i>himself</i> to the earth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_53"><sup>53</sup>Then the servant brought out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:10, 22; Ex. 3:22; 11:2; 12:35">⚓</a>jewelry of silver, jewelry of gold, and clothing, and gave <i>them</i> to Rebekah. He also gave <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:3; Ezra 1:6">⚓</a>precious things to her brother and to her mother.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_54"> <sup>54</sup>And he and the men who <i>were</i> with him ate and drank and stayed all night. Then they arose in the morning, and he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:56, 59; 30:25">⚓</a>“Send me away to my master.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_55"> <sup>55</sup>But her brother and her mother said, “Let the young woman stay with us <i>a</i> <i>few</i> days, at least ten; after that she may go.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_56"> <sup>56</sup>And he said to them, “Do not hinder me, since the Lord has prospered my way; send me away so that I may go to my master.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_57"> <sup>57</sup>So they said, “We will call the young woman and ask her personally.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_58"><sup>58</sup>Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?”<br/> And she said, “I will go.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_59"> <sup>59</sup>So they sent away Rebekah their sister <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:8">⚓</a>and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant and his men. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_60"><sup>60</sup>And they blessed Rebekah and said to her:<br/>  “Our sister, <i>may</i> you <i>become</i><br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:16">⚓</a><i>The</i> <i>mother</i> <i>of</i> thousands of ten thousands;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:17; 28:14">⚓</a> And may your descendants possess<br/>   The gates of those who hate them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_61"> <sup>61</sup>Then Rebekah and her maids arose, and they rode on the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_62"> <sup>62</sup>Now Isaac came from the way of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:14; 25:11">⚓</a>Beer Lahai Roi, for he dwelt in the South. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_63"><sup>63</sup>And Isaac went out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:8; Ps. 1:2; 77:12; 119:15, 27, 48; 143:5; 145:5">⚓</a>to meditate in the field in the evening; and he lifted his eyes and looked, and there, the camels <i>were</i> coming. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_64"><sup>64</sup>Then Rebekah lifted her eyes, and when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:18">⚓</a>she saw Isaac she dismounted from her camel; </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_65"><sup>65</sup>for she had said to the servant, “Who <i>is</i> this man walking in the field to meet us?”<br/> The servant said, “It <i>is</i> my master.” So she took a veil and covered herself.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_24_66"> <sup>66</sup>And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. </span>
<span class="verse sa_24_67"><sup>67</sup>Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent; and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:20; 29:20; Prov. 18:22">⚓</a>took Rebekah and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 23:1, 2; 38:12">⚓</a>was comforted after his mother’s <i>death.</i><br/></span>
