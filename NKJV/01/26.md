<div class="title"><h1>26</h1><h3>Isaac and Abimelech</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_26_1"> <sup>1</sup>There was a famine in the land, besides <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:10">⚓</a>the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:1, 2">⚓</a>Abimelech king of the Philistines, in Gerar.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_26_2"> <sup>2</sup>Then the Lord appeared to him and said: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:7; 17:1; 18:1; 35:9">⚓</a>“Do not go down to Egypt; live in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:1">⚓</a>the land of which I shall tell you. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:1; Ps. 39:12; Heb. 11:9">⚓</a>Dwell in this land, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:13, 15">⚓</a>I will be with you and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:2">⚓</a>bless you; for to you and your descendants <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 15:18">⚓</a>I give all these lands, and I will perform <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:16; Ps. 105:9">⚓</a>the oath which I swore to Abraham your father. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_4"><sup>4</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:5; 22:17; Ex. 32:13">⚓</a>I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of heaven; I will give to your descendants all these lands; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:3; 22:18; Gal. 3:8">⚓</a>and in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed; </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:16, 18">⚓</a>because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_26_6"> <sup>6</sup>So Isaac dwelt in Gerar. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_7"><sup>7</sup>And the men of the place asked about his wife. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:13; 20:2, 12, 13">⚓</a>he said, “She <i>is</i> my sister”; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 29:25">⚓</a>he was afraid to say, “<i>She</i> <i>is</i> my wife,” <i>because</i> <i>he</i> <i>thought,</i> “lest the men of the place kill me for Rebekah, because she <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:11; 24:16; 29:17">⚓</a>beautiful to behold.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_8"><sup>8</sup>Now it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked through a window, and saw, and there was Isaac, showing endearment to Rebekah his wife. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_9"><sup>9</sup>Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, “Quite obviously she <i>is</i> your wife; so how could you say, ‘She <i>is</i> my sister’?”<br/> Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die on account of her.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_26_10"> <sup>10</sup>And Abimelech said, “What <i>is</i> this you have done to us? One of the people might soon have lain with your wife, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:9">⚓</a>you would have brought guilt on us.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_11"><sup>11</sup>So Abimelech charged all <i>his</i> people, saying, “He who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:15">⚓</a>touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_26_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:8, 23; Mark 4:8">⚓</a>a hundredfold; and the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:1; 25:8, 11; 26:3; Job 42:12; Prov. 10:22">⚓</a>blessed him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_13"><sup>13</sup>The man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:35; (Prov. 10:22)">⚓</a>began to prosper, and continued prospering until he became very prosperous; </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_14"><sup>14</sup>for he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great number of servants. So the Philistines <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:11; Eccl. 4:4">⚓</a>envied him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_15"><sup>15</sup>Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:25, 30">⚓</a>which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and they had filled them with earth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_16"><sup>16</sup>And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:9">⚓</a>you are much mightier than we.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_26_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Isaac departed from there and pitched his tent in the Valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_18"><sup>18</sup>And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:31">⚓</a>He called them by the names which his father had called them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_26_19"> <sup>19</sup>Also Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found a well of running water there. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_20"><sup>20</sup>But the herdsmen of Gerar <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:25">⚓</a>quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water <i>is</i> ours.” So he called the name of the well Esek, because they quarreled with him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_21"><sup>21</sup>Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that <i>one</i> also. So he called its name Sitnah. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_22"><sup>22</sup>And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, because he said, “For now the Lord has made room for us, and we shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:6; 28:3; 41:52; Ex. 1:7">⚓</a>be fruitful in the land.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_26_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then he went up from there to Beersheba. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_24"><sup>24</sup>And the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:2">⚓</a>appeared to him the same night and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:7, 8; 24:12; Ex. 3:6; Acts 7:32">⚓</a>“I <i>am</i> the God of your father Abraham; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:1">⚓</a>do not fear, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:3, 4">⚓</a>I <i>am</i> with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for My servant Abraham’s sake.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_25"><sup>25</sup>So he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:7, 8; 13:4, 18; 22:9; 33:20">⚓</a>built an altar there and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:33; Ps. 116:17">⚓</a>called on the name of the Lord, and he pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_26_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath, one of his friends, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:22">⚓</a>and Phichol the commander of his army. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_27"><sup>27</sup>And Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:7">⚓</a>since you hate me and have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:16">⚓</a>sent me away from you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_26_28"> <sup>28</sup>But they said, “We have certainly seen that the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:22, 23">⚓</a>is with you. So we said, ‘Let there now be an oath between us, between you and us; and let us make a covenant with you, </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_29"><sup>29</sup>that you will do us no harm, since we have not touched you, and since we have done nothing to you but good and have sent you away in peace. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:31; Ps. 115:15">⚓</a>You <i>are</i> now the blessed of the Lord.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_26_30"> <sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:3">⚓</a>So he made them a feast, and they ate and drank. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_31"><sup>31</sup>Then they arose early in the morning and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:31">⚓</a>swore an oath with one another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_26_32"> <sup>32</sup>It came to pass the same day that Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_33"><sup>33</sup>So he called it Shebah. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:31; 28:10">⚓</a>Therefore the name of the city <i>is</i> Beersheba to this day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_26_34"> <sup>34</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:8; 36:2">⚓</a>When Esau was forty years old, he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite. </span>
<span class="verse sa_26_35"><sup>35</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:46; 28:1, 8">⚓</a>they were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah.<br/></span>
