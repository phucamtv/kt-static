<div class="title"><h1>27</h1><h3>Isaac Blesses Jacob</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_27_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass, when Isaac was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:28">⚓</a>old and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:10; 1 Sam. 3:2">⚓</a>his eyes were so dim that he could not see, that he called Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.”<br/> And he answered him, “Here I am.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_2"> <sup>2</sup>Then he said, “Behold now, I am old. I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 27:1; James 4:14)">⚓</a>do not know the day of my death. </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:27, 28">⚓</a>Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me. </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_4"><sup>4</sup>And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring <i>it</i> to me that I may eat, that my soul <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:19, 25, 27, 31; 48:9, 15, 16; 49:28; Deut. 33:1; Heb. 11:20">⚓</a>may bless you before I die.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt game and to bring <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_6"><sup>6</sup>So Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Indeed I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying, </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_7"><sup>7</sup>‘Bring me game and make savory food for me, that I may eat it and bless you in the presence of the Lord before my death.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_8"><sup>8</sup>Now therefore, my son, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:13, 43">⚓</a>obey my voice according to what I command you. </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_9"><sup>9</sup>Go now to the flock and bring me from there two choice kids of the goats, and I will make <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:4">⚓</a>savory food from them for your father, such as he loves. </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_10"><sup>10</sup>Then you shall take <i>it</i> to your father, that he may eat <i>it,</i> and that he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:4; 48:16">⚓</a>may bless you before his death.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_11"> <sup>11</sup>And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Look, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:25">⚓</a>Esau my brother <i>is</i> a hairy man, and I <i>am</i> a smooth-<i>skinned</i> man. </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_12"><sup>12</sup>Perhaps my father will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:21, 22">⚓</a>feel me, and I shall seem to be a deceiver to him; and I shall bring <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:25; Deut. 27:18">⚓</a>a curse on myself and not a blessing.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_13"> <sup>13</sup>But his mother said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:9; 1 Sam. 25:24; 2 Sam. 14:9; Matt. 27:25">⚓</a>“<i>Let</i> your curse <i>be</i> on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get <i>them</i> for me.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_14"><sup>14</sup>And he went and got <i>them</i> and brought <i>them</i> to his mother, and his mother <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 23:3; Luke 21:34">⚓</a>made savory food, such as his father loved. </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_15"><sup>15</sup>Then Rebekah took the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:27">⚓</a>choice clothes of her elder son Esau, which <i>were</i> with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_16"><sup>16</sup>And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_17"><sup>17</sup>Then she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_18"> <sup>18</sup>So he went to his father and said, “My father.”<br/> And he said, “Here I am. Who <i>are</i> you, my son?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_19"> <sup>19</sup>Jacob said to his father, “I <i>am</i> Esau your firstborn; I have done just as you told me; please arise, sit and eat of my game, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:4">⚓</a>that your soul may bless me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_20"> <sup>20</sup>But Isaac said to his son, “How <i>is</i> <i>it</i> that you have found <i>it</i> so quickly, my son?”<br/> And he said, “Because the Lord your God brought <i>it</i> to me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_21"> <sup>21</sup>Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:12">⚓</a>may feel you, my son, whether you <i>are</i> really my son Esau or not.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_22"><sup>22</sup>So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said, “The voice <i>is</i> Jacob’s voice, but the hands <i>are</i> the hands of Esau.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_23"><sup>23</sup>And he did not recognize him, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:16">⚓</a>his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then he said, “<i>Are</i> you really my son Esau?”<br/> He said, “I <i>am.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_25"> <sup>25</sup>He said, “Bring <i>it</i> near to me, and I will eat of my son’s game, so <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:4, 10, 19, 31">⚓</a>that my soul may bless you.” So he brought <i>it</i> near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank. </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_26"><sup>26</sup>Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near now and kiss me, my son.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_27"><sup>27</sup>And he came near and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:13">⚓</a>kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed him and said:<br/>  “Surely, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Song 4:11; Hos. 14:6">⚓</a>the smell of my son<br/>   <i>Is</i> like the smell of a field<br/>   Which the Lord has blessed.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_28">   <sup>28</sup>Therefore may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 11:20">⚓</a>God give you<br/>   Of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:39; Deut. 33:13, 28; 2 Sam. 1:21; Ps. 133:3; Prov. 3:20; Mic. 5:7; Zech. 8:12">⚓</a>the dew of heaven,<br/>   Of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:18; Num. 18:12">⚓</a>the fatness of the earth,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:13; 33:28">⚓</a>plenty of grain and wine.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_29">   <sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:25; 25:23; Is. 45:14; 49:7; 60:12, 14">⚓</a>Let peoples serve you,<br/>   And nations bow down to you.<br/>   Be master over your brethren,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:7, 10; 49:8">⚓</a>let your mother’s sons bow down to you.<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:2, 3; Zeph. 2:8, 9">⚓</a>Cursed <i>be</i> everyone who curses you,<br/>   And blessed <i>be</i> those who bless you!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Esau’s Lost Hope</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_27_30"> <sup>30</sup>Now it happened, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_31"><sup>31</sup>He also had made savory food, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, “Let my father arise and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:4">⚓</a>eat of his son’s game, that your soul may bless me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_32"> <sup>32</sup>And his father Isaac said to him, “Who <i>are</i> you?”<br/> So he said, “I <i>am</i> your son, your firstborn, Esau.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_33"> <sup>33</sup>Then Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, “Who? Where <i>is</i> the one who hunted game and brought <i>it</i> to me? I ate all <i>of</i> <i>it</i> before you came, and I have blessed him—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:23; 28:3, 4; Num. 23:20; Rom. 11:29">⚓</a><i>and</i> indeed he shall be blessed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_34"> <sup>34</sup>When Esau heard the words of his father, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 12:17)">⚓</a>he cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, “Bless me—me also, O my father!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_35"> <sup>35</sup>But he said, “Your brother came with deceit and has taken away your blessing.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_36"> <sup>36</sup>And <i>Esau</i> said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:26, 32–34">⚓</a>“Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright, and now look, he has taken away my blessing!” And he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_37"> <sup>37</sup>Then Isaac answered and said to Esau, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:14">⚓</a>“Indeed I have made him your master, and all his brethren I have given to him as servants; with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:28, 29">⚓</a>grain and wine I have sustained him. What shall I do now for you, my son?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_38"> <sup>38</sup>And Esau said to his father, “Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me—me also, O my father!” And Esau lifted up his voice <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 12:17">⚓</a>and wept.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_39"> <sup>39</sup>Then Isaac his father answered and said to him:<br/>  “Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:28; Heb. 11:20">⚓</a>your dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth,<br/>   And of the dew of heaven from above.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_40">   <sup>40</sup>By your sword you shall live,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:23; 27:29; 2 Sam. 8:14; (Obad. 18–20)">⚓</a>you shall serve your brother;<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:20–22">⚓</a>it shall come to pass, when you become restless,<br/>   That you shall break his yoke from your neck.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jacob Escapes from Esau</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_27_41"> <sup>41</sup>So Esau <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:27; 32:3–11; 37:4, 5, 8">⚓</a>hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:2–4, 10">⚓</a>“The days of mourning for my father are at hand; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Obad. 10">⚓</a>then I will kill my brother Jacob.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_42"> <sup>42</sup>And the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, “Surely your brother Esau <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 64:5">⚓</a>comforts himself concerning you <i>by</i> <i>intending</i> to kill you. </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_43"><sup>43</sup>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: arise, flee to my brother Laban <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 11:31; 25:20; 28:2, 5">⚓</a>in Haran. </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_44"><sup>44</sup>And stay with him a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:41">⚓</a>few days, until your brother’s fury turns away, </span>
<span class="verse sa_27_45"><sup>45</sup>until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereaved also of you both in one day?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_27_46"> <sup>46</sup>And Rebekah said to Isaac, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:34, 35; 28:8">⚓</a>“I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:3">⚓</a>if Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, like these <i>who</i> <i>are</i> the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?”<br/></span>
