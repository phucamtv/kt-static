<div class="title"><h1>29</h1><h3>Jacob Meets Rachel</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_29_1"> <sup>1</sup>So Jacob went on his journey <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:6; Num. 23:7; Judg. 6:3, 33; Hos. 12:12">⚓</a>and came to the land of the people of the East. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_2"><sup>2</sup>And he looked, and saw a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:10, 11; Ex. 2:15, 16">⚓</a>well in the field; and behold, there <i>were</i> three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks. A large stone <i>was</i> on the well’s mouth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_3"><sup>3</sup>Now all the flocks would be gathered there; and they would roll the stone from the well’s mouth, water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place on the well’s mouth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_29_4"> <sup>4</sup>And Jacob said to them, “My brethren, where <i>are</i> you from?”<br/> And they said, “We <i>are</i> from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 11:31; 28:10">⚓</a>Haran.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_29_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then he said to them, “Do you know <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:24, 29; 28:2">⚓</a>Laban the son of Nahor?”<br/> And they said, “We know him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_29_6"> <sup>6</sup>So he said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:27">⚓</a>“Is he well?”<br/> And they said, “<i>He</i> <i>is</i> well. And look, his daughter Rachel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:11; Ex. 2:16, 17">⚓</a>is coming with the sheep.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_29_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then he said, “Look, <i>it</i> <i>is</i> still high day; <i>it</i> <i>is</i> not time for the cattle to be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go and feed <i>them.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_29_8"> <sup>8</sup>But they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and they have rolled the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_29_9"> <sup>9</sup>Now while he was still speaking with them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:16">⚓</a>Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_10"><sup>10</sup>And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:17">⚓</a>rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_11"><sup>11</sup>Then Jacob <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:4; 45:14, 15">⚓</a>kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_12"><sup>12</sup>And Jacob told Rachel that he <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:8; 14:14, 16; 28:5">⚓</a>her father’s relative and that he <i>was</i> Rebekah’s son. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:28">⚓</a>So she ran and told her father.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_29_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then it came to pass, when Laban heard the report about Jacob his sister’s son, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:29–31; Luke 15:20">⚓</a>he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. So he told Laban all these things. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_14"><sup>14</sup>And Laban said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:23; 37:27; Judg. 9:2; 2 Sam. 5:1; 19:12, 13">⚓</a>“Surely you <i>are</i> my bone and my flesh.” And he stayed with him for a month.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_29_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you <i>are</i> my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:28; 31:41">⚓</a>what <i>should</i> your wages <i>be?</i>” </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_16"><sup>16</sup>Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder <i>was</i> Leah, and the name of the younger <i>was</i> Rachel. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_17"><sup>17</sup>Leah’s eyes <i>were</i> delicate, but Rachel was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:11, 14; 26:7">⚓</a>beautiful of form and appearance.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_29_18"> <sup>18</sup>Now Jacob loved Rachel; so he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:41; 2 Sam. 3:14; Hos. 12:12">⚓</a>“I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_29_19"> <sup>19</sup>And Laban said, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_20"><sup>20</sup>So Jacob <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:26; Hos. 12:12">⚓</a>served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed <i>only</i> a few days to him because of the love he had for her.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_29_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give <i>me</i> my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 15:1">⚓</a>go in to her.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_22"><sup>22</sup>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 14:10; John 2:1, 2">⚓</a>made a feast. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_23"><sup>23</sup>Now it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_24"><sup>24</sup>And Laban gave his maid <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:9, 10">⚓</a>Zilpah to his daughter Leah <i>as</i> a maid. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_25"><sup>25</sup>So it came to pass in the morning, that behold, it <i>was</i> Leah. And he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served you? Why then have you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:35; 31:7; 1 Sam. 28:12">⚓</a>deceived me?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_29_26"> <sup>26</sup>And Laban said, “It must not be done so in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:41; Judg. 14:2">⚓</a>Fulfill her week, and we will give you this one also for the service which you will serve with me still another seven years.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_29_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then Jacob did so and fulfilled her week. So he gave him his daughter Rachel as wife also. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_29"><sup>29</sup>And Laban gave his maid <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:3–5">⚓</a>Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as a maid. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_30"><sup>30</sup>Then <i>Jacob</i> also went in to Rachel, and he also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:17–20; Deut. 21:15–17">⚓</a>loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served with Laban <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:26; 31:41; Hos. 12:12">⚓</a>still another seven years.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Children of Jacob</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_29_31"> <sup>31</sup>When the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 127:3">⚓</a>saw that Leah <i>was</i> unloved, He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:1">⚓</a>opened her womb; but Rachel <i>was</i> barren. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_32"><sup>32</sup>So Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, “The Lord has surely <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:11; 31:42; Ex. 3:7; 4:31; Deut. 26:7; Ps. 25:18">⚓</a>looked on my affliction. Now therefore, my husband will love me.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_33"><sup>33</sup>Then she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Because the Lord has heard that I <i>am</i> unloved, He has therefore given me this <i>son</i> also.” And she called his name Simeon. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_34"><sup>34</sup>She conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Now this time my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi. </span>
<span class="verse sa_29_35"><sup>35</sup>And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, “Now I will praise the Lord.” Therefore she called his name <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:8; Matt. 1:2">⚓</a>Judah. Then she stopped bearing.<br/></span>
