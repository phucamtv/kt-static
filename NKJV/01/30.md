<span class="verse sa_30_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now when Rachel saw that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:1, 2; 29:31">⚓</a>she bore Jacob no children, Rachel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:11">⚓</a>envied her sister, and said to Jacob, “Give me children, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:5, 6; (Job 5:2)">⚓</a>or else I die!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_2"> <sup>2</sup>And Jacob’s anger was aroused against Rachel, and he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:2; 1 Sam. 1:5">⚓</a>“<i>Am</i> I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_3"> <sup>3</sup>So she said, “Here is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:2">⚓</a>my maid Bilhah; go in to her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:23; Job 3:12">⚓</a>and she will bear <i>a</i> <i>child</i> on my knees, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:2, 3">⚓</a>that I also may have children by her.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_4"><sup>4</sup>Then she gave him Bilhah her maid <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:3, 4">⚓</a>as wife, and Jacob went in to her. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_5"><sup>5</sup>And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_6"><sup>6</sup>Then Rachel said, “God has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:25; Ps. 35:24; 43:1; Lam. 3:59">⚓</a>judged my case; and He has also heard my voice and given me a son.” Therefore she called his name Dan. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_7"><sup>7</sup>And Rachel’s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_8"><sup>8</sup>Then Rachel said, “With great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, <i>and</i> indeed I have prevailed.” So she called his name Naphtali.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_9"> <sup>9</sup>When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took Zilpah her maid and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:4">⚓</a>gave her to Jacob as wife. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_10"><sup>10</sup>And Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a son. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_11"><sup>11</sup>Then Leah said, “A troop comes!” So she called his name Gad. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_12"><sup>12</sup>And Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_13"><sup>13</sup>Then Leah said, “I am happy, for the daughters <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 31:28; Luke 1:48">⚓</a>will call me blessed.” So she called his name Asher.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_14"> <sup>14</sup>Now Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:30">⚓</a>“Please give me <i>some</i> of your son’s mandrakes.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_15"> <sup>15</sup>But she said to her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Num. 16:9, 13)">⚓</a>“<i>Is</i> <i>it</i> a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes also?”<br/> And Rachel said, “Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_16"> <sup>16</sup>When Jacob came out of the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” And he lay with her that night.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_17"> <sup>17</sup>And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_18"><sup>18</sup>Leah said, “God has given me my wages, because I have given my maid to my husband.” So she called his name Issachar. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_19"><sup>19</sup>Then Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_20"><sup>20</sup>And Leah said, “God has endowed me <i>with</i> a good endowment; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.” So she called his name Zebulun. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_21"><sup>21</sup>Afterward she bore a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:1">⚓</a>daughter, and called her name Dinah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:29; 1 Sam. 1:19, 20">⚓</a>remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:31">⚓</a>opened her womb. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_23"><sup>23</sup>And she conceived and bore a son, and said, “God has taken away <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:6; Is. 4:1; Luke 1:25">⚓</a>my reproach.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_24"><sup>24</sup>So she called his name Joseph, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:16–18">⚓</a>“The Lord shall add to me another son.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jacob’s Agreement with Laban</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_30_25"> <sup>25</sup>And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:54, 56">⚓</a>“Send me away, that I may go to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:33">⚓</a>my own place and to my country. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_26"><sup>26</sup>Give <i>me</i> my wives and my children <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:18–20, 27, 30; Hos. 12:12">⚓</a>for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my service which <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:24; 39:3; Is. 61:9">⚓</a>I have done for you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_27"> <sup>27</sup>And Laban said to him, “Please <i>stay,</i> if I have found favor in your eyes, <i>for</i> I have learned by experience that the Lord has blessed me for your sake.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_28"><sup>28</sup>Then he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:15; 31:7, 41">⚓</a>“Name me your wages, and I will give <i>it.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_29"> <sup>29</sup>So <i>Jacob</i> said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:6, 38–40; Matt. 24:45; Titus 2:10">⚓</a>“You know how I have served you and how your livestock has been with me. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_30"><sup>30</sup>For what you had before I <i>came</i> <i>was</i> little, and it has increased to a great amount; the Lord has blessed you since my coming. And now, when shall I also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Tim. 5:8)">⚓</a>provide for my own house?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_31"> <sup>31</sup>So he said, “What shall I give you?”<br/> And Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep your flocks: </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_32"><sup>32</sup>Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from there all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:8">⚓</a><i>these</i> shall be my wages. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_33"><sup>33</sup>So my <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 37:6">⚓</a>righteousness will answer for me in time to come, when the subject of my wages comes before you: every one that <i>is</i> not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the lambs, will be considered stolen, if <i>it</i> <i>is</i> with me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_34"> <sup>34</sup>And Laban said, “Oh, that it were according to your word!” </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_35"><sup>35</sup>So he removed that day the male goats that were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:9–12">⚓</a>speckled and spotted, all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had <i>some</i> white in it, and all the brown ones among the lambs, and gave <i>them</i> into the hand of his sons. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_36"><sup>36</sup>Then he put three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_37"> <sup>37</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:9–12">⚓</a>Jacob took for himself rods of green poplar and of the almond and chestnut trees, peeled white strips in them, and exposed the white which <i>was</i> in the rods. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_38"><sup>38</sup>And the rods which he had peeled, he set before the flocks in the gutters, in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, so that they should conceive when they came to drink. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_39"><sup>39</sup>So the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth streaked, speckled, and spotted. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_40"><sup>40</sup>Then Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the brown in the flock of Laban; but he put his own flocks by themselves and did not put them with Laban’s flock.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_30_41"> <sup>41</sup>And it came to pass, whenever the stronger livestock conceived, that Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the livestock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_42"><sup>42</sup>But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put <i>them</i> in; so the feebler were Laban’s and the stronger Jacob’s. </span>
<span class="verse sa_30_43"><sup>43</sup>Thus the man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:16; 30:30">⚓</a>became exceedingly prosperous, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:2; 24:35; 26:13, 14">⚓</a>had large flocks, female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.<br/></span>
