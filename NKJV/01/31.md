<div class="title"><h1>31</h1><h3>Jacob Flees from Laban</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_31_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <i>Jacob</i> heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s, and from what was our father’s he has acquired all this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 49:16">⚓</a>wealth.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_2"><sup>2</sup>And Jacob saw the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:5">⚓</a>countenance of Laban, and indeed it <i>was</i> not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:54">⚓</a><i>favorable</i> toward him as before. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_3"><sup>3</sup>Then the Lord said to Jacob, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:15, 20, 21; 32:9">⚓</a>“Return to the land of your fathers and to your family, and I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:4">⚓</a>be with you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_31_4"> <sup>4</sup>So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field, to his flock, </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_5"><sup>5</sup>and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:2, 3">⚓</a>“I see your father’s countenance, that it <i>is</i> not <i>favorable</i> toward me as before; but the God of my father <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:22; 28:13, 15; 31:29, 42, 53; Is. 41:10; Heb. 13:5">⚓</a>has been with me. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_6"><sup>6</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:29; 31:38–41">⚓</a>you know that with all my might I have served your father. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_7"><sup>7</sup>Yet your father has deceived me and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:25; 31:41">⚓</a>changed my wages <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:22; Neh. 4:12; Job 19:3; Zech. 8:23">⚓</a>ten times, but God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:1; 20:6; 31:29; Job 1:10; Ps. 37:28; 105:14">⚓</a>did not allow him to hurt me. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_8"><sup>8</sup>If he said thus: ‘The speckled shall be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore speckled. And if he said thus: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:32">⚓</a>‘The streaked shall be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore streaked. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_9"><sup>9</sup>So God has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:1, 16">⚓</a>taken away the livestock of your father and given <i>them</i> to me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_31_10"> <sup>10</sup>“And it happened, at the time when the flocks conceived, that I lifted my eyes and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the flocks <i>were</i> streaked, speckled, and gray-spotted. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_11"><sup>11</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:7–11; 22:11, 15; 31:13; 48:16">⚓</a>the Angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, ‘Jacob.’ And I said, ‘Here I am.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_12"><sup>12</sup>And He said, ‘Lift your eyes now and see, all the rams which leap on the flocks <i>are</i> streaked, speckled, and gray-spotted; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:42; Ex. 3:7; Ps. 139:3; Eccl. 5:8">⚓</a>I have seen all that Laban is doing to you. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_13"><sup>13</sup>I <i>am</i> the God of Bethel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:16–22; 35:1, 6, 15">⚓</a>where you anointed the pillar <i>and</i> where you made a vow to Me. Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:3; 32:9">⚓</a>arise, get out of this land, and return to the land of your family.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_31_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:24">⚓</a>“Is there still any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house? </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_15"><sup>15</sup>Are we not considered strangers by him? For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:15, 20, 23, 27; Neh. 5:8">⚓</a>he has sold us, and also completely consumed our money. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_16"><sup>16</sup>For all these riches which God has taken from our father are <i>really</i> ours and our children’s; now then, whatever God has said to you, do it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_31_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Jacob rose and set his sons and his wives on camels. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_18"><sup>18</sup>And he carried away all his livestock and all his possessions which he had gained, his acquired livestock which he had gained in Padan Aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:8; 33:18; 35:27">⚓</a>Canaan. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_19"><sup>19</sup>Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel had stolen the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:30, 34; 35:2; Judg. 17:5; 1 Sam. 19:13; Hos. 3:4">⚓</a>household idols that were her father’s. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_20"><sup>20</sup>And Jacob stole away, unknown to Laban the Syrian, in that he did not tell him that he intended to flee. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_21"><sup>21</sup>So he fled with all that he had. He arose and crossed the river, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:28; 2 Kin. 12:17; Luke 9:51, 53">⚓</a>headed toward the mountains of Gilead.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Laban Pursues Jacob</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_31_22"> <sup>22</sup>And Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_23"><sup>23</sup>Then he took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:8">⚓</a>his brethren with him and pursued him for seven days’ journey, and he overtook him in the mountains of Gilead. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_24"><sup>24</sup>But God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:3; 31:29; 46:2–4; Job 33:15; Matt. 1:20">⚓</a>had come to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said to him, “Be careful that you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:50; 31:7, 29">⚓</a>speak to Jacob neither good nor bad.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_31_25"> <sup>25</sup>So Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountains, and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountains of Gilead.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_31_26"> <sup>26</sup>And Laban said to Jacob: “What have you done, that you have stolen away unknown to me, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 30:2">⚓</a>carried away my daughters like captives <i>taken</i> with the sword? </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_27"><sup>27</sup>Why did you flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and not tell me; for I might have sent you away with joy and songs, with timbrel and harp? </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_28"><sup>28</sup>And you did not allow me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:55; Ruth 1:9, 14; 1 Kin. 19:20; Acts 20:37">⚓</a>to kiss my sons and my daughters. Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:13">⚓</a>you have done foolishly in <i>so</i> doing. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_29"><sup>29</sup>It is in my power to do you harm, but the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:13; 31:5, 24, 42, 53">⚓</a>God of your father spoke to me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:24">⚓</a>last night, saying, ‘Be careful that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_30"><sup>30</sup>And now you have surely gone because you greatly long for your father’s house, <i>but</i> why did you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:19; Josh. 24:2; Judg. 17:5; 18:24">⚓</a>steal my gods?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_31_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then Jacob answered and said to Laban, “Because I was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:7; 32:7, 11">⚓</a>afraid, for I said, ‘Perhaps you would take your daughters from me by force.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_32"><sup>32</sup>With whomever you find your gods, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 44:9">⚓</a>do not let him live. In the presence of our brethren, identify what I have of yours and take <i>it</i> with you.” For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_31_33"> <sup>33</sup>And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the two maids’ tents, but he did not find <i>them.</i> Then he went out of Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_34"><sup>34</sup>Now Rachel had taken the household idols, put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. And Laban searched all about the tent but did not find <i>them.</i></span>
<span class="verse sa_31_35"><sup>35</sup>And she said to her father, “Let it not displease my lord that I cannot <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:12; Lev. 19:32">⚓</a>rise before you, for the manner of women <i>is</i> with me.” And he searched but did not find the household idols.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_31_36"> <sup>36</sup>Then Jacob was angry and rebuked Laban, and Jacob answered and said to Laban: “What <i>is</i> my trespass? What <i>is</i> my sin, that you have so hotly pursued me? </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_37"><sup>37</sup>Although you have searched all my things, what part of your household things have you found? Set <i>it</i> here before my brethren and your brethren, that they may judge between us both! </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_38"><sup>38</sup>These twenty years I <i>have</i> <i>been</i> with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried their young, and I have not eaten the rams of your flock. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_39"><sup>39</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:10">⚓</a>That which was torn <i>by</i> <i>beasts</i> I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:10–13">⚓</a>You required it from my hand, <i>whether</i> stolen by day or stolen by night. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_40"><sup>40</sup><i>There</i> I was! In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep departed from my eyes. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_41"><sup>41</sup>Thus I have been in your house twenty years; I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:20, 27–30">⚓</a>served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:7">⚓</a>you have changed my wages ten times. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_42"><sup>42</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:5, 29, 53; Ps. 124:1, 2">⚓</a>Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:53; Is. 8:13">⚓</a>the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:32; Ex. 3:7">⚓</a>God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:24, 29; 1 Chr. 12:17">⚓</a>rebuked <i>you</i> last night.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Laban’s Covenant with Jacob</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_31_43"> <sup>43</sup>And Laban answered and said to Jacob, “<i>These</i> daughters <i>are</i> my daughters, and <i>these</i> children <i>are</i> my children, and <i>this</i> flock <i>is</i> my flock; all that you see <i>is</i> mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne? </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_44"><sup>44</sup>Now therefore, come, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:27, 32; 26:28">⚓</a>let us make a covenant, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:27">⚓</a>you and I, and let it be a witness between you and me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_31_45"> <sup>45</sup>So Jacob <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:18; 35:14; Josh. 24:26, 27">⚓</a>took a stone and set it up <i>as</i> a pillar. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_46"><sup>46</sup>Then Jacob said to his brethren, “Gather stones.” And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there on the heap. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_47"><sup>47</sup>Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_48"><sup>48</sup>And Laban said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:27">⚓</a>“This heap <i>is</i> a witness between you and me this day.” Therefore its name was called Galeed, </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_49"><sup>49</sup>also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:17; 11:29; 1 Sam. 7:5, 6">⚓</a>Mizpah, because he said, “May the Lord watch between you and me when we are absent one from another. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_50"><sup>50</sup>If you afflict my daughters, or if you take <i>other</i> wives besides my daughters, <i>although</i> no man <i>is</i> with us—see, God <i>is</i> witness between you and me!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_31_51"> <sup>51</sup>Then Laban said to Jacob, “Here is this heap and here is <i>this</i> pillar, which I have placed between you and me. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_52"><sup>52</sup>This heap <i>is</i> a witness, and <i>this</i> pillar <i>is</i> a witness, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you, and you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, for harm. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_53"><sup>53</sup>The God of Abraham, the God of Nahor, and the God of their father <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:5">⚓</a>judge between us.” And Jacob <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:23">⚓</a>swore by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:42">⚓</a>the Fear of his father Isaac. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_54"><sup>54</sup>Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread. And they ate bread and stayed all night on the mountain. </span>
<span class="verse sa_31_55"><sup>55</sup>And early in the morning Laban arose, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:11, 13; 31:28, 43">⚓</a>kissed his sons and daughters and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:1">⚓</a>blessed them. Then Laban departed and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:33; 30:25; Num. 24:25">⚓</a>returned to his place.<br/></span>
