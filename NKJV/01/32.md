<div class="title"><h1>32</h1><h3>Esau Comes to Meet Jacob</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_32_1"> <sup>1</sup>So Jacob went on his way, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:31; 2 Kin. 6:16, 17; (Ps. 34:7; 91:1; Heb. 1:14)">⚓</a>the angels of God met him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_2"><sup>2</sup>When Jacob saw them, he said, “This <i>is</i> God’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:14; Ps. 103:21; 148:2; Luke 2:13">⚓</a>camp.” And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_32_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:6; 33:14, 16">⚓</a>in the land of Seir, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:30; 36:6–9; Deut. 2:5; Josh. 24:4">⚓</a>the country of Edom. </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_4"><sup>4</sup>And he commanded them, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 15:1">⚓</a>“Speak thus to my lord Esau, ‘Thus your servant Jacob says: “I have dwelt with Laban and stayed there until now. </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:43">⚓</a>I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:8, 15">⚓</a>I may find favor in your sight.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_32_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:1">⚓</a>he also is coming to meet you, and four hundred men <i>are</i> with him.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_7"><sup>7</sup>So Jacob was greatly afraid and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:11; 35:3">⚓</a>distressed; and he divided the people that <i>were</i> with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies. </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_8"><sup>8</sup>And he said, “If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it, then the other company which is left will escape.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_32_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 50:15)">⚓</a>Then Jacob said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:13; 31:42">⚓</a>“O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:3, 13">⚓</a>who said to me, ‘Return to your country and to your family, and I will deal well with you’: </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_10"><sup>10</sup>I am not worthy of the least of all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:27">⚓</a>mercies and of all the truth which You have shown Your servant; for I crossed over this Jordan with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 8:7">⚓</a>my staff, and now I have become two companies. </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 59:1, 2">⚓</a>Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and attack me <i>and</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 10:14">⚓</a>the mother with the children. </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_12"><sup>12</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:13–15">⚓</a>You said, ‘I will surely treat you well, and make your descendants as the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:17">⚓</a>sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_32_13"> <sup>13</sup>So he lodged there that same night, and took what came to his hand as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:11">⚓</a>a present for Esau his brother: </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_14"><sup>14</sup>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_15"><sup>15</sup>thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals. </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_16"><sup>16</sup>Then he delivered <i>them</i> to the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put some distance between successive droves.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_17"><sup>17</sup>And he commanded the first one, saying, “When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going? Whose <i>are</i> these in front of you?’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_18"><sup>18</sup>then you shall say, ‘They <i>are</i> your servant Jacob’s. It <i>is</i> a present sent to my lord Esau; and behold, he also <i>is</i> behind us.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_19"><sup>19</sup>So he commanded the second, the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, “In this manner you shall speak to Esau when you find him; </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_20"><sup>20</sup>and also say, ‘Behold, your servant Jacob <i>is</i> behind us.’ ” For he said, “I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 21:14)">⚓</a>appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_21"><sup>21</sup>So the present went on over before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Wrestling with God</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_32_22"> <sup>22</sup>And he arose that night and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:24; Deut. 3:16; Josh. 12:2">⚓</a>and crossed over the ford of Jabbok. </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_23"><sup>23</sup>He took them, sent them over the brook, and sent over what he had. </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_24"><sup>24</sup>Then Jacob was left alone; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:13–15; Hos. 12:2–4">⚓</a>a Man wrestled with him until the breaking of day. </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_25"><sup>25</sup>Now when He saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:41; 2 Cor. 12:7">⚓</a>the socket of Jacob’s hip was out of joint as He wrestled with him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_26"><sup>26</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:28">⚓</a>He said, “Let Me go, for the day breaks.”<br/> But he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 12:4">⚓</a>“I will not let You go unless You bless me!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_32_27"> <sup>27</sup>So He said to him, “What <i>is</i> your name?”<br/> He said, “Jacob.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_32_28"> <sup>28</sup>And He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:10; 1 Kin. 18:31; 2 Kin. 17:34">⚓</a>“Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 12:3, 4">⚓</a>struggled with God and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:31; 27:33">⚓</a>with men, and have prevailed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_32_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then Jacob asked, saying, “Tell <i>me</i> Your name, I pray.”<br/> And He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 13:17, 18">⚓</a>“Why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> you ask about My name?” And He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:9">⚓</a>blessed him there.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_32_30"> <sup>30</sup>So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: “For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:13; Ex. 24:10, 11; 33:20; Num. 12:8; Deut. 5:24; Judg. 6:22; Is. 6:5; (Matt. 5:8; 1 Cor. 13:12)">⚓</a>I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_31"><sup>31</sup>Just as he crossed over Penuel the sun rose on him, and he limped on his hip. </span>
<span class="verse sa_32_32"><sup>32</sup>Therefore to this day the children of Israel do not eat the muscle that shrank, which <i>is</i> on the hip socket, because He touched the socket of Jacob’s hip in the muscle that shrank.<br/></span>
