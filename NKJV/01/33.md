<div class="title"><h1>33</h1><h3>Jacob and Esau Meet</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_33_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and there, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:6">⚓</a>Esau was coming, and with him were four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants. </span>
<span class="verse sa_33_2"><sup>2</sup>And he put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last. </span>
<span class="verse sa_33_3"><sup>3</sup>Then he crossed over before them and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:2; 42:6">⚓</a>bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_33_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:28">⚓</a>But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:14, 15">⚓</a>and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept. </span>
<span class="verse sa_33_5"><sup>5</sup>And he lifted his eyes and saw the women and children, and said, “Who <i>are</i> these with you?”<br/> So he said, “The children <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:9; (Ps. 127:3); Is. 8:18">⚓</a>whom God has graciously given your servant.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_33_6"><sup>6</sup>Then the maidservants came near, they and their children, and bowed down. </span>
<span class="verse sa_33_7"><sup>7</sup>And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward Joseph and Rachel came near, and they bowed down.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_33_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Esau said, “What <i>do</i> you <i>mean</i> <i>by</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:13–16">⚓</a>all this company which I met?”<br/> And he said, “<i>These</i> <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:5">⚓</a>to find favor in the sight of my lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_33_9"> <sup>9</sup>But Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_33_10"> <sup>10</sup>And Jacob said, “No, please, if I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:3; 2 Sam. 3:13; 14:24, 28, 32">⚓</a>have now found favor in your sight, then receive my present from my hand, inasmuch as I have seen your face as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me. </span>
<span class="verse sa_33_11"><sup>11</sup>Please, take <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:15; 1 Sam. 25:27; 30:26">⚓</a>my blessing that is brought to you, because God has dealt <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:43; Ex. 33:19">⚓</a>graciously with me, and because I have enough.” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 5:23">⚓</a>So he urged him, and he took <i>it.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_33_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then Esau said, “Let us take our journey; let us go, and I will go before you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_33_13"> <sup>13</sup>But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children <i>are</i> weak, and the flocks and herds which are nursing <i>are</i> with me. And if the men should drive them hard one day, all the flock will die. </span>
<span class="verse sa_33_14"><sup>14</sup>Please let my lord go on ahead before his servant. I will lead on slowly at a pace which the livestock that go before me, and the children, are able to endure, until I come to my lord <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:3; 36:8">⚓</a>in Seir.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_33_15"> <sup>15</sup>And Esau said, “Now let me leave with you <i>some</i> of the people who <i>are</i> with me.”<br/> But he said, “What need is there? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:11; 47:25; Ruth 2:13">⚓</a>Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_33_16"><sup>16</sup>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir. </span>
<span class="verse sa_33_17"><sup>17</sup>And Jacob journeyed to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 13:27; Judg. 8:5; Ps. 60:6">⚓</a>Succoth, built himself a house, and made booths for his livestock. Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jacob Comes to Canaan</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_33_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then Jacob came safely to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:23">⚓</a>the city of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:6; 35:4; Josh. 24:1; Judg. 9:1; Ps. 60:6">⚓</a>Shechem, which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan Aram; and he pitched his tent before the city. </span>
<span class="verse sa_33_19"><sup>19</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:32; John 4:5">⚓</a>he bought the parcel of land, where he had pitched his tent, from the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred pieces of money. </span>
<span class="verse sa_33_20"><sup>20</sup>Then he erected an altar there and called it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:7">⚓</a>El Elohe Israel.<br/></span>
