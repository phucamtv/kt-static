<div class="title"><h1>34</h1><h3>The Dinah Incident</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_34_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:21">⚓</a>Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_2"><sup>2</sup>And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:2">⚓</a>took her and lay with her, and violated her. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_3"><sup>3</sup>His soul was strongly attracted to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman and spoke kindly to the young woman. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_4"><sup>4</sup>So Shechem <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 14:2">⚓</a>spoke to his father Hamor, saying, “Get me this young woman as a wife.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_34_5"> <sup>5</sup>And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter. Now his sons were with his livestock in the field; so Jacob <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 13:22">⚓</a>held his peace until they came. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_6"><sup>6</sup>Then Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_7"><sup>7</sup>And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard <i>it;</i> and the men were grieved and very angry, because he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 22:20–30; Josh. 7:15; Judg. 20:6">⚓</a>had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 23:17; 2 Sam. 13:12">⚓</a>a thing which ought not to be done. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_8"><sup>8</sup>But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_9"><sup>9</sup>And make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to yourselves. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_10"><sup>10</sup>So you shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you. Dwell and trade in it, and acquire possessions for yourselves in it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_34_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then Shechem said to her father and her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you say to me I will give. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_12"><sup>12</sup>Ask me ever so much <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:16, 17; Deut. 22:29">⚓</a>dowry and gift, and I will give according to what you say to me; but give me the young woman as a wife.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_34_13"> <sup>13</sup>But the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father, and spoke <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:7; Ex. 8:29">⚓</a>deceitfully, because he had defiled Dinah their sister. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_14"><sup>14</sup>And they said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one who is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:48">⚓</a>uncircumcised, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:2–9">⚓</a>that <i>would</i> <i>be</i> a reproach to us. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_15"><sup>15</sup>But on this <i>condition</i> we will consent to you: If you will become as we <i>are,</i> if every male of you is circumcised, </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_16"><sup>16</sup>then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us; and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_17"><sup>17</sup>But if you will not heed us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and be gone.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_34_18"> <sup>18</sup>And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_19"><sup>19</sup>So the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob’s daughter. He <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 4:9">⚓</a>more honorable than all the household of his father.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_34_20"> <sup>20</sup>And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:1; 23:10; Ruth 4:1, 11; 2 Sam. 15:2">⚓</a>gate of their city, and spoke with the men of their city, saying: </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_21"><sup>21</sup>“These men <i>are</i> at peace with us. Therefore let them dwell in the land and trade in it. For indeed the land <i>is</i> large enough for them. Let us take their daughters to us as wives, and let us give them our daughters. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_22"><sup>22</sup>Only on this <i>condition</i> will the men consent to dwell with us, to be one people: if every male among us is circumcised as they <i>are</i> circumcised. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_23"><sup>23</sup><i>Will</i> not their livestock, their property, and every animal of theirs <i>be</i> ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_24"><sup>24</sup>And all who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 23:10, 18">⚓</a>went out of the gate of his city heeded Hamor and Shechem his son; every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_34_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, that two of the sons of Jacob, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:33, 34; 42:24; 49:5–7">⚓</a>Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his sword and came boldly upon the city and killed all the males. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_26"><sup>26</sup>And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:5, 6">⚓</a>killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah from Shechem’s house, and went out. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_27"><sup>27</sup>The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because their sister had been defiled. </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_28"><sup>28</sup>They took their sheep, their oxen, and their donkeys, what <i>was</i> in the city and what <i>was</i> in the field, </span>
<span class="verse sa_34_29"><sup>29</sup>and all their wealth. All their little ones and their wives they took captive; and they plundered even all that <i>was</i> in the houses.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_34_30"> <sup>30</sup>Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:6">⚓</a>“You have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:25">⚓</a>troubled me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 5:21; 1 Sam. 13:4; 2 Sam. 10:6">⚓</a>by making me obnoxious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:26, 27; Deut. 4:27; 1 Chr. 16:19; Ps. 105:12">⚓</a>and since I <i>am</i> few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and kill me. I shall be destroyed, my household and I.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_34_31"> <sup>31</sup>But they said, “Should he treat our sister like a harlot?”<br/></span>
