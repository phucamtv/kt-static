<div class="title"><h1>35</h1><h3>Jacob’s Return to Bethel</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_35_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:19; 31:13">⚓</a>Bethel and dwell there; and make an altar there to God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:13">⚓</a>who appeared to you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:43">⚓</a>when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_2"> <sup>2</sup>And Jacob said to his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:19; Josh. 24:15">⚓</a>household and to all who <i>were</i> with him, “Put away <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:19, 30, 34; Josh. 24:2, 14, 23">⚓</a>the foreign gods that <i>are</i> among you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:10, 14; Lev. 13:6">⚓</a>purify yourselves, and change your garments. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_3"><sup>3</sup>Then let us arise and go up to Bethel; and I will make an altar there to God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:7, 24; Ps. 107:6">⚓</a>who answered me in the day of my distress <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:15, 20; 31:3, 42">⚓</a>and has been with me in the way which I have gone.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_4"><sup>4</sup>So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods which <i>were</i> in their hands, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 2:13">⚓</a>earrings which <i>were</i> in their ears; and Jacob hid them under <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:26; Judg. 9:6">⚓</a>the terebinth tree which <i>was</i> by Shechem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_5"> <sup>5</sup>And they journeyed, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:16; 23:27; (Deut. 2:25; 11:25); Josh. 2:9; 1 Sam. 14:15">⚓</a>the terror of God was upon the cities that <i>were</i> all around them, and they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_6"><sup>6</sup>So Jacob came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:19, 22; 48:3">⚓</a>Luz (that <i>is,</i> Bethel), which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who <i>were</i> with him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_7"><sup>7</sup>And he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:20; 35:3; Eccl. 5:4">⚓</a>built an altar there and called the place El Bethel, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:13">⚓</a>there God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:59">⚓</a>Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the terebinth tree. So the name of it was called Allon Bachuth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:13; Dan. 10:5">⚓</a>God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Padan Aram, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:29; Hos. 12:4">⚓</a>blessed him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_10"><sup>10</sup>And God said to him, “Your name <i>is</i> Jacob; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:5">⚓</a>your name shall not be called Jacob anymore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:28">⚓</a>but Israel shall be your name.” So He called his name Israel. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_11"><sup>11</sup>Also God said to him: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:1; 28:3; 48:3, 4; Ex. 6:3">⚓</a>“I <i>am</i> God Almighty. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:1, 7">⚓</a>Be fruitful and multiply; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:5, 6, 16; 28:3; 48:4">⚓</a>a nation and a company of nations shall proceed from you, and kings shall come from your body. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_12"><sup>12</sup>The <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 26:3, 4; 28:13; 48:4; Ex. 32:13">⚓</a>land which I gave Abraham and Isaac I give to you; and to your descendants after you I give this land.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_13"><sup>13</sup>Then God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:22; 18:33">⚓</a>went up from him in the place where He talked with him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_14"><sup>14</sup>So Jacob <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:18, 19; 31:45">⚓</a>set up a pillar in the place where He talked with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_15"><sup>15</sup>And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:19">⚓</a>Bethel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Rachel</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_35_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then they journeyed from Bethel. And when there was but a little distance to go to Ephrath, Rachel labored <i>in</i> <i>childbirth,</i> and she had hard labor. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_17"><sup>17</sup>Now it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, “Do not fear; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:24; 1 Sam. 4:20">⚓</a>you will have this son also.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_18"><sup>18</sup>And so it was, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-Oni; but his father called him Benjamin. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_19"><sup>19</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:7">⚓</a>Rachel died and was buried on the way to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:2; 4:11; Mic. 5:2; Matt. 2:6">⚓</a>Ephrath (that <i>is,</i> Bethlehem). </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_20"><sup>20</sup>And Jacob set a pillar on her grave, which <i>is</i> the pillar of Rachel’s grave <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:2">⚓</a>to this day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_35_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Israel journeyed and pitched his tent beyond <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mic. 4:8">⚓</a>the tower of Eder. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_22"><sup>22</sup>And it happened, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:4; 1 Chr. 5:1">⚓</a>lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine; and Israel heard <i>about</i> <i>it.</i><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jacob’s Twelve Sons</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_35_22"> Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_23"><sup>23</sup>the sons of Leah <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:31–35; 30:18–20; 46:8; Ex. 1:1–4">⚓</a>Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun; </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_24"><sup>24</sup>the sons of Rachel <i>were</i> Joseph and Benjamin; </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_25"><sup>25</sup>the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maidservant, <i>were</i> Dan and Naphtali; </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_26"><sup>26</sup>and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maidservant, <i>were</i> Gad and Asher. These <i>were</i> the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Padan Aram.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Isaac</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_35_27"> <sup>27</sup>Then Jacob came to his father Isaac at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:18; 18:1; 23:19">⚓</a>Mamre, or <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 14:15">⚓</a>Kirjath Arba (that <i>is,</i> Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had dwelt. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_28"><sup>28</sup>Now the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years. </span>
<span class="verse sa_35_29"><sup>29</sup>So Isaac breathed his last and died, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:15; 25:8; 49:33">⚓</a>was gathered to his people, <i>being</i> old and full of days. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:9; 49:31">⚓</a>his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.<br/></span>
