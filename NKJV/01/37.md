<div class="title"><h1>37</h1><h3>Joseph Dreams of Greatness</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_37_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Jacob dwelt in the land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:8; 23:4; 28:4; 36:7; Heb. 11:9">⚓</a>where his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_2"><sup>2</sup>This <i>is</i> the history of Jacob.<br/> Joseph, <i>being</i> seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. And the lad <i>was</i> with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:25, 26; 1 Sam. 2:22–24">⚓</a>bad report of them to his father.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_3"> <sup>3</sup>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 44:20">⚓</a>the son of his old age. Also he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:23, 32; Judg. 5:30; 1 Sam. 2:19">⚓</a>made him a tunic of <i>many</i> colors. </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_4"><sup>4</sup>But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:41; 49:23; 1 Sam. 17:28; John 15:18–20">⚓</a>hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now Joseph had a dream, and he told <i>it</i> to his brothers; and they hated him even more. </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_6"><sup>6</sup>So he said to them, “Please hear this dream which I have dreamed: </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:6, 9; 43:26; 44:14">⚓</a>There we were, binding sheaves in the field. Then behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and indeed your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_8"> <sup>8</sup>And his brothers said to him, “Shall you indeed reign over us? Or shall you indeed have dominion over us?” So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then he dreamed still another dream and told it to his brothers, and said, “Look, I have dreamed another dream. And this time, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:29; 47:25">⚓</a>the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_10"> <sup>10</sup>So he told <i>it</i> to his father and his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, “What <i>is</i> this dream that you have dreamed? Shall your mother and I and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:29">⚓</a>your brothers indeed come to bow down to the earth before you?” </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_11"><sup>11</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:17, 18; Acts 7:9">⚓</a>his brothers envied him, but his father <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:28; Luke 2:19, 51">⚓</a>kept the matter <i>in</i> <i>mind.</i><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Joseph Sold by His Brothers</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_37_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then his brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem. </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_13"><sup>13</sup>And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers feeding <i>the</i> <i>flock</i> in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:18–20">⚓</a>Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.”<br/> So he said to him, “Here I am.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then he said to him, “Please go and see if it is well with your brothers and well with the flocks, and bring back word to me.” So he sent him out of the Valley of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:18; 23:2, 19; 35:27; Josh. 14:14, 15; Judg. 1:10">⚓</a>Hebron, and he went to Shechem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_15"> <sup>15</sup>Now a certain man found him, and there he was, wandering in the field. And the man asked him, saying, “What are you seeking?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_16"> <sup>16</sup>So he said, “I am seeking my brothers. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Song 1:7">⚓</a>Please tell me where they are feeding <i>their</i> <i>flocks.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_17"> <sup>17</sup>And the man said, “They have departed from here, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’ ” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 6:13">⚓</a>Dothan.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_18"> <sup>18</sup>Now when they saw him afar off, even before he came near them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:1; Ps. 31:13; 37:12, 32; Matt. 21:38; 26:3, 4; 27:1; Mark 14:1; John 11:53; Acts 23:12">⚓</a>they conspired against him to kill him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_19"><sup>19</sup>Then they said to one another, “Look, this dreamer is coming! </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:22; Prov. 1:11">⚓</a>Come therefore, let us now kill him and cast him into some pit; and we shall say, ‘Some wild beast has devoured him.’ We shall see what will become of his dreams!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_21"> <sup>21</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:22">⚓</a>Reuben heard <i>it,</i> and he delivered him out of their hands, and said, “Let us not kill him.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_22"><sup>22</sup>And Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood, <i>but</i> cast him into this pit which <i>is</i> in the wilderness, and do not lay a hand on him”—that he might deliver him out of their hands, and bring him back to his father.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_23"> <sup>23</sup>So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:28">⚓</a>stripped Joseph <i>of</i> his tunic, the tunic of <i>many</i> colors that <i>was</i> on him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_24"><sup>24</sup>Then they took him and cast him into a pit. And the pit <i>was</i> empty; <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no water in it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_25"> <sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 30:20">⚓</a>And they sat down to eat a meal. Then they lifted their eyes and looked, and there was a company of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:11, 12; 37:28, 36; 39:1">⚓</a>Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead with their camels, bearing spices, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 8:22">⚓</a>balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry <i>them</i> down to Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_26"><sup>26</sup>So Judah said to his brothers, “What profit <i>is</i> <i>there</i> if we kill our brother and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:20">⚓</a>conceal his blood? </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_27"><sup>27</sup>Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:17">⚓</a>let not our hand be upon him, for he <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:21">⚓</a>our brother <i>and</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:14">⚓</a>our flesh.” And his brothers listened. </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_28"><sup>28</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:25; Judg. 6:1–3; 8:22, 24">⚓</a>Midianite traders passed by; so <i>the</i> <i>brothers</i> pulled Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:4, 5; Ps. 105:17; Acts 7:9">⚓</a>and sold him to the Ishmaelites for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:9">⚓</a>twenty <i>shekels</i> of silver. And they took Joseph to Egypt.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then Reuben returned to the pit, and indeed Joseph <i>was</i> not in the pit; and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:34; 44:13; Job 1:20">⚓</a>tore his clothes. </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_30"><sup>30</sup>And he returned to his brothers and said, “The lad <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:13, 36">⚓</a><i>is</i> no <i>more;</i> and I, where shall I go?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_31"> <sup>31</sup>So they took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:3, 23">⚓</a>Joseph’s tunic, killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the tunic in the blood. </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_32"><sup>32</sup>Then they sent the tunic of <i>many</i> colors, and they brought <i>it</i> to their father and said, “We have found this. Do you know whether it <i>is</i> your son’s tunic or not?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_33"> <sup>33</sup>And he recognized it and said, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> my son’s tunic. A <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:20">⚓</a>wild beast has devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_34"><sup>34</sup>Then Jacob <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:29; 2 Sam. 3:31">⚓</a>tore his clothes, put sackcloth on his waist, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:10">⚓</a>mourned for his son many days. </span>
<span class="verse sa_37_35"><sup>35</sup>And all his sons and all his daughters <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:17">⚓</a>arose to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and he said, “For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:8; 35:29; 42:38; 44:29, 31">⚓</a>I shall go down into the grave to my son in mourning.” Thus his father wept for him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_37_36"> <sup>36</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:1">⚓</a>the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh <i>and</i> captain of the guard.<br/></span>
