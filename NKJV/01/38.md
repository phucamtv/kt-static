<div class="title"><h1>38</h1><h3>Judah and Tamar</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_38_1"> <sup>1</sup>It came to pass at that time that Judah departed from his brothers, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:8">⚓</a>visited a certain Adullamite whose name <i>was</i> Hirah. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_2"><sup>2</sup>And Judah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:2">⚓</a>saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 2:3">⚓</a>Shua, and he married her and went in to her. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_3"><sup>3</sup>So she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:12; Num. 26:19">⚓</a>Er. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_4"><sup>4</sup>She conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:12; Num. 26:19">⚓</a>Onan. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_5"><sup>5</sup>And she conceived yet again and bore a son, and called his name <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:20">⚓</a>Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_38_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then Judah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:21">⚓</a>took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 4:12">⚓</a>Tamar. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_7"><sup>7</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:12; Num. 26:19">⚓</a>Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 2:3">⚓</a>and the Lord killed him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_8"><sup>8</sup>And Judah said to Onan, “Go in to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 25:5, 6; Matt. 22:24">⚓</a>your brother’s wife and marry her, and raise up an heir to your brother.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_9"><sup>9</sup>But Onan knew that the heir would not be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 25:6">⚓</a>his; and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother’s wife, that he emitted on the ground, lest he should give an heir to his brother. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_10"><sup>10</sup>And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; therefore He killed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:12; Num. 26:19">⚓</a>him also.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_38_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:12, 13">⚓</a>“Remain a widow in your father’s house till my son Shelah is grown.” For he said, “Lest he also die like his brothers.” And Tamar went and dwelt <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 22:13">⚓</a>in her father’s house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_38_12"> <sup>12</sup>Now in the process of time the daughter of Shua, Judah’s wife, died; and Judah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 13:39">⚓</a>was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_13"><sup>13</sup>And it was told Tamar, saying, “Look, your father-in-law is going up <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:10, 57; Judg. 14:1">⚓</a>to Timnah to shear his sheep.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_14"><sup>14</sup>So she took off her widow’s garments, covered <i>herself</i> with a veil and wrapped herself, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 7:12">⚓</a>sat in an open place which <i>was</i> on the way to Timnah; for she saw <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 38:11, 26">⚓</a>that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as a wife. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_15"><sup>15</sup>When Judah saw her, he thought she <i>was</i> a harlot, because she had covered her face. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_16"><sup>16</sup>Then he turned to her by the way, and said, “Please let me come in to you”; for he did not know that she <i>was</i> his daughter-in-law.<br/> So she said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_38_17"> <sup>17</sup>And he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 15:1; Ezek. 16:33">⚓</a>“I will send a young goat from the flock.”<br/> So she said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 38:20">⚓</a>“Will you give <i>me</i> a pledge till you send <i>it?</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_38_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then he said, “What pledge shall I give you?”<br/> So she said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 38:25; 41:42">⚓</a>“Your signet and cord, and your staff that <i>is</i> in your hand.” Then he gave <i>them</i> to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_19"><sup>19</sup>So she arose and went away, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 38:14">⚓</a>laid aside her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_38_20"> <sup>20</sup>And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive <i>his</i> pledge from the woman’s hand, but he did not find her. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_21"><sup>21</sup>Then he asked the men of that place, saying, “Where is the harlot who <i>was</i> openly by the roadside?”<br/> And they said, “There was no harlot in this <i>place.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_38_22"> <sup>22</sup>So he returned to Judah and said, “I cannot find her. Also, the men of the place said there was no harlot in this <i>place.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_38_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then Judah said, “Let her take <i>them</i> for herself, lest we be shamed; for I sent this young goat and you have not found her.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_38_24"> <sup>24</sup>And it came to pass, about three months after, that Judah was told, saying, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:2">⚓</a>played the harlot; furthermore she <i>is</i> with child by harlotry.”<br/> So Judah said, “Bring her out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 20:14; 21:9; Deut. 22:21">⚓</a>and let her be burned!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_38_25"> <sup>25</sup>When she <i>was</i> brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man to whom these belong, I <i>am</i> with child.” And she said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:32; 38:18">⚓</a>“Please determine whose these <i>are</i>—the signet and cord, and staff.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_38_26"> <sup>26</sup>So Judah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:33">⚓</a>acknowledged <i>them</i> and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:17">⚓</a>“She has been more righteous than I, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 38:14">⚓</a>I did not give her to Shelah my son.” And he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 34:31, 32">⚓</a>never knew her again.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_38_27"> <sup>27</sup>Now it came to pass, at the time for giving birth, that behold, twins <i>were</i> in her womb. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_28"><sup>28</sup>And so it was, when she was giving birth, that <i>the</i> <i>one</i> put out <i>his</i> hand; and the midwife took a scarlet <i>thread</i> and bound it on his hand, saying, “This one came out first.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_29"><sup>29</sup>Then it happened, as he drew back his hand, that his brother came out unexpectedly; and she said, “How did you break through? <i>This</i> breach <i>be</i> upon you!” Therefore his name was called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:12; Num. 26:20; Ruth 4:12; 1 Chr. 2:4; Matt. 1:3">⚓</a>Perez. </span>
<span class="verse sa_38_30"><sup>30</sup>Afterward his brother came out who had the scarlet <i>thread</i> on his hand. And his name was called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:12; 1 Chr. 2:4; Matt. 1:3">⚓</a>Zerah.<br/></span>
