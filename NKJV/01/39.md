<div class="title"><h1>39</h1><h3>Joseph a Slave in Egypt</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_39_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Joseph had been taken <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:10; 43:15">⚓</a>down to Egypt. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:36; Ps. 105:17">⚓</a>Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:28; 45:4">⚓</a>bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there. </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:24, 28; 28:15; 35:3; 39:3, 21, 23; 1 Sam. 16:18; 18:14, 28; Acts 7:9">⚓</a>The Lord was with Joseph, and he was a successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_3"><sup>3</sup>And his master saw that the Lord<i>was</i> with him and that the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 1:3">⚓</a>made all he did to prosper in his hand. </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_4"><sup>4</sup>So Joseph <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:3; 19:19; 39:21">⚓</a>found favor in his sight, and served him. Then he made him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:2, 10; 39:8, 22; 41:40">⚓</a>overseer of his house, and all <i>that</i> he had he put under his authority. </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_5"><sup>5</sup>So it was, from the time <i>that</i> he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:26; 30:27; 2 Sam. 6:11">⚓</a>the Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the Lord was on all that he had in the house and in the field. </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_6"><sup>6</sup>Thus he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate.<br/> Now Joseph <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:17; 1 Sam. 16:12">⚓</a>was handsome in form and appearance.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_39_7"> <sup>7</sup>And it came to pass after these things that his master’s wife cast longing eyes on Joseph, and she said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 13:11">⚓</a>“Lie with me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_39_8"> <sup>8</sup>But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Look, my master does not know what <i>is</i> with me in the house, and he has committed all that he has to my hand. </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_9"><sup>9</sup><i>There</i> <i>is</i> no one greater in this house than I, nor has he kept back anything from me but you, because you <i>are</i> his wife. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 20:10; Prov. 6:29, 32">⚓</a>How then can I do this great wickedness, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:6; 42:18; 2 Sam. 12:13; Ps. 51:4">⚓</a>sin against God?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_39_10"> <sup>10</sup>So it was, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 1:10">⚓</a>did not heed her, to lie with her <i>or</i> to be with her.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_39_11"> <sup>11</sup>But it happened about this time, when Joseph went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house <i>was</i> inside, </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_12"><sup>12</sup>that she <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 7:13">⚓</a>caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me.” But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and ran outside. </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_13"><sup>13</sup>And so it was, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and fled outside, </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_14"><sup>14</sup>that she called to the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, “See, he has brought in to us a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:13; 41:12">⚓</a>Hebrew to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice. </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_15"><sup>15</sup>And it happened, when he heard that I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me, and fled and went outside.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_39_16"> <sup>16</sup>So she kept his garment with her until his master came home. </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_17"><sup>17</sup>Then she <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:1; Ps. 120:3; Prov. 26:28">⚓</a>spoke to him with words like these, saying, “The Hebrew servant whom you brought to us came in to me to mock me; </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_18"><sup>18</sup>so it happened, as I lifted my voice and cried out, that he left his garment with me and fled outside.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_39_19"> <sup>19</sup>So it was, when his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, saying, “Your servant did to me after this manner,” that his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 6:34, 35">⚓</a>anger was aroused. </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_20"><sup>20</sup>Then Joseph’s master took him and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:18; (1 Pet. 2:19)">⚓</a>put him into the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:3, 15; 41:14">⚓</a>prison, a place where the king’s prisoners <i>were</i> confined. And he was there in the prison. </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_21"><sup>21</sup>But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy, and He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:2; Ex. 3:21; Ps. 105:19; (Prov. 16:7); Dan. 1:9; Acts 7:9, 10">⚓</a>gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_22"><sup>22</sup>And the keeper of the prison <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:4; 40:3, 4">⚓</a>committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who <i>were</i> in the prison; whatever they did there, it was his doing. </span>
<span class="verse sa_39_23"><sup>23</sup>The keeper of the prison did not look into anything <i>that</i> <i>was</i> under <i>Joseph’s</i> authority, because the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:2, 3">⚓</a>Lord was with him; and whatever he did, the Lord made <i>it</i> prosper.<br/></span>
