<div class="title"><h1>40</h1><h3>The Prisoners’ Dreams</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_40_1"> <sup>1</sup>It came to pass after these things <i>that</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:11, 13; Neh. 1:11">⚓</a>butler and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their lord, the king of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_2"><sup>2</sup>And Pharaoh was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 16:14">⚓</a>angry with his two officers, the chief butler and the chief baker. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:1, 20, 23; 41:10">⚓</a>So he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison, the place where Joseph <i>was</i> confined. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_4"><sup>4</sup>And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; so they were in custody for a while.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_40_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who <i>were</i> confined in the prison, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:5; 41:1">⚓</a>had a dream, both of them, each man’s dream in one night <i>and</i> each man’s dream with its <i>own</i> interpretation. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_6"><sup>6</sup>And Joseph came in to them in the morning and looked at them, and saw that they <i>were</i> sad. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_7"><sup>7</sup>So he asked Pharaoh’s officers who <i>were</i> with him in the custody of his lord’s house, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:2">⚓</a>“Why do you look <i>so</i> sad today?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_40_8"> <sup>8</sup>And they said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:15">⚓</a>“We each have had a dream, and <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no interpreter of it.”<br/> So Joseph said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 41:16; Dan. 2:11, 20–22, 27, 28, 47)">⚓</a>“Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell <i>them</i> to me, please.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_40_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “Behold, in my dream a vine <i>was</i> before me, </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_10"><sup>10</sup>and in the vine <i>were</i> three branches; it <i>was</i> as though it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_11"><sup>11</sup>Then Pharaoh’s cup <i>was</i> in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_40_12"> <sup>12</sup>And Joseph said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:18; 41:12, 25; Judg. 7:14; Dan. 2:36; 4:18, 19">⚓</a>“This <i>is</i> the interpretation of it: The three branches <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:18; 42:17">⚓</a><i>are</i> three days. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_13"><sup>13</sup>Now within three days Pharaoh will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:27; Ps. 3:3; Jer. 52:31">⚓</a>lift up your head and restore you to your place, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand according to the former manner, when you were his butler. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_14"><sup>14</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:31; Luke 23:42">⚓</a>remember me when it is well with you, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:49; 47:29; Josh. 2:12; 1 Sam. 20:14, 15; 2 Sam. 9:1; 1 Kin. 2:7">⚓</a>please show kindness to me; make mention of me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this house. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_15"><sup>15</sup>For indeed I was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:26–28">⚓</a>stolen away from the land of the Hebrews; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:20">⚓</a>and also I have done nothing here that they should put me into the dungeon.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_40_16"> <sup>16</sup>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also <i>was</i> in my dream, and there <i>were</i> three white baskets on my head. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_17"><sup>17</sup>In the uppermost basket <i>were</i> all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_40_18"> <sup>18</sup>So Joseph answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:12">⚓</a>“This <i>is</i> the interpretation of it: The three baskets <i>are</i> three days. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:13">⚓</a>Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head from you and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 21:22">⚓</a>hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_40_20"> <sup>20</sup>Now it came to pass on the third day, <i>which</i> <i>was</i> Pharaoh’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:6–10">⚓</a>birthday, that he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:21">⚓</a>made a feast for all his servants; and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:13, 19; 2 Kin. 25:27; Jer. 52:31; Matt. 25:19">⚓</a>lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_21"><sup>21</sup>Then he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:13">⚓</a>restored the chief butler to his butlership again, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:1">⚓</a>he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_22"><sup>22</sup>But he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:19; Deut. 21:23; Esth. 7:10">⚓</a>hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. </span>
<span class="verse sa_40_23"><sup>23</sup>Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 19:14; Ps. 31:12; Eccl. 9:15, 16; Is. 49:15; Amos 6:6">⚓</a>forgot him.<br/></span>
