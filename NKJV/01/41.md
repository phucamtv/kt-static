<div class="title"><h1>41</h1><h3>Pharaoh’s Dreams</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_41_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then it came to pass, at the end of two full years, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:5; Judg. 7:13">⚓</a>Pharaoh had a dream; and behold, he stood by the river. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_2"><sup>2</sup>Suddenly there came up out of the river seven cows, fine looking and fat; and they fed in the meadow. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_3"><sup>3</sup>Then behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ugly and gaunt, and stood by the <i>other</i> cows on the bank of the river. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_4"><sup>4</sup>And the ugly and gaunt cows ate up the seven fine looking and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_5"><sup>5</sup>He slept and dreamed a second time; and suddenly seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, plump and good. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_6"><sup>6</sup>Then behold, seven thin heads, blighted by the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 10:13; Ezek. 17:10">⚓</a>east wind, sprang up after them. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_7"><sup>7</sup>And the seven thin heads devoured the seven plump and full heads. So Pharaoh awoke, and indeed, <i>it</i> <i>was</i> a dream. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_8"><sup>8</sup>Now it came to pass in the morning <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:1, 3; 4:5, 19">⚓</a>that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:11, 22; Is. 29:14; Dan. 1:20; 2:2; 4:7">⚓</a>the magicians of Egypt and all its <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 2:1">⚓</a>wise men. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no one who could interpret them for Pharaoh.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_41_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:1, 14, 23">⚓</a>chief butler spoke to Pharaoh, saying: “I remember my faults this day. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_10"><sup>10</sup>When Pharaoh was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:2, 3">⚓</a>angry with his servants, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:20">⚓</a>and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, <i>both</i> me and the chief baker, </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:5; Judg. 7:15">⚓</a>we each had a dream in one night, he and I. Each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his <i>own</i> dream. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_12"><sup>12</sup>Now there <i>was</i> a young <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:14; 43:32">⚓</a>Hebrew man with us there, a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:36">⚓</a>servant of the captain of the guard. And we told him, and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:12">⚓</a>interpreted our dreams for us; to each man he interpreted according to his <i>own</i> dream. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_13"><sup>13</sup>And it came to pass, just <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:21, 22">⚓</a>as he interpreted for us, so it happened. He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_41_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:20">⚓</a>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:25">⚓</a>brought him quickly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Sam. 2:8)">⚓</a>out of the dungeon; and he shaved, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:27–29">⚓</a>changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_15"><sup>15</sup>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no one who can interpret it. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:8, 12; Dan. 5:16">⚓</a>But I have heard it said of you <i>that</i> you can understand a dream, to interpret it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_41_16"> <sup>16</sup>So Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:30; Acts 3:12; (2 Cor. 3:5)">⚓</a>“<i>It</i> <i>is</i> not in me; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:8; 41:25, 28, 32; Deut. 29:29; Dan. 2:22, 28, 47">⚓</a>God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_41_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: “Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:1">⚓</a>in my dream I stood on the bank of the river. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_18"><sup>18</sup>Suddenly seven cows came up out of the river, fine looking and fat; and they fed in the meadow. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_19"><sup>19</sup>Then behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly and gaunt, such ugliness as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_20"><sup>20</sup>And the gaunt and ugly cows ate up the first seven, the fat cows. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_21"><sup>21</sup>When they had eaten them up, no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they <i>were</i> just as ugly as at the beginning. So I awoke. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_22"><sup>22</sup>Also I saw in my dream, and suddenly seven heads came up on one stalk, full and good. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_23"><sup>23</sup>Then behold, seven heads, withered, thin, <i>and</i> blighted by the east wind, sprang up after them. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_24"><sup>24</sup>And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads. So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:8; Ex. 7:11; Is. 8:19; Dan. 4:7">⚓</a>I told <i>this</i> to the magicians, but <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no one who could explain <i>it</i> to me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_41_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh <i>are</i> one; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:28, 32; Dan. 2:28, 29, 45; Rev. 4:1">⚓</a>God has shown Pharaoh what He <i>is</i> about to do: </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_26"><sup>26</sup>The seven good cows <i>are</i> seven years, and the seven good heads <i>are</i> seven years; the dreams <i>are</i> one. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_27"><sup>27</sup>And the seven thin and ugly cows which came up after them <i>are</i> seven years, and the seven empty heads blighted by the east wind are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:1">⚓</a>seven years of famine. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_28"><sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 41:25, 32; Dan. 2:28)">⚓</a>This <i>is</i> the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what He <i>is</i> about to do. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_29"><sup>29</sup>Indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:47">⚓</a>seven years of great plenty will come throughout all the land of Egypt; </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_30"><sup>30</sup>but after them seven years of famine will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:54, 56">⚓</a>arise, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:13; Ps. 105:16">⚓</a>will deplete the land. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_31"><sup>31</sup>So the plenty will not be known in the land because of the famine following, for it <i>will</i> <i>be</i> very severe. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_32"><sup>32</sup>And the dream was repeated to Pharaoh twice because the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:25, 28; Num. 23:19; Is. 46:10, 11">⚓</a>thing <i>is</i> established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_41_33"> <sup>33</sup>“Now therefore, let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_34"><sup>34</sup>Let Pharaoh do <i>this,</i> and let him appoint officers over the land, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 6:6–8)">⚓</a>to collect one-fifth <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>produce</i> of the land of Egypt in the seven plentiful years. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_35"><sup>35</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:48">⚓</a>let them gather all the food of those good years that are coming, and store up grain under the authority of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_36"><sup>36</sup>Then that food shall be as a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt, that the land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:15, 19">⚓</a>may not perish during the famine.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Joseph’s Rise to Power</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_41_37"> <sup>37</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:19; Acts 7:10">⚓</a>the advice was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_38"><sup>38</sup>And Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find <i>such</i> <i>a</i> <i>one</i> as this, a man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:18; (Job 32:8; Prov. 2:6); Dan. 4:8, 9, 18; 5:11, 14; 6:3">⚓</a>in whom <i>is</i> the Spirit of God?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_41_39"> <sup>39</sup>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Inasmuch as God has shown you all this, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no one as discerning and wise as you. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_40"><sup>40</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:21; Acts 7:10">⚓</a>You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be ruled according to your word; only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_41"><sup>41</sup>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:6; Ps. 105:21; Dan. 6:3; Acts 7:10">⚓</a>set you over all the land of Egypt.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_41_42"> <sup>42</sup>Then Pharaoh <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 3:10">⚓</a>took his signet ring off his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand; and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 8:2, 15">⚓</a>clothed him in garments of fine linen <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 5:7, 16, 29">⚓</a>and put a gold chain around his neck. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_43"><sup>43</sup>And he had him ride in the second <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:29">⚓</a>chariot which he had; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 6:9">⚓</a>and they cried out before him, “Bow the knee!” So he set him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:6">⚓</a>over all the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_44"><sup>44</sup>Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “I <i>am</i> Pharaoh, and without your consent no man may lift his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_45"><sup>45</sup>And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-Paaneah. And he gave him as a wife <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:20">⚓</a>Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On. So Joseph went out over <i>all</i> the land of Egypt.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_41_46"> <sup>46</sup>Joseph was thirty years old when he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:21; 1 Kin. 12:6, 8; Dan. 1:19">⚓</a>stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_47"><sup>47</sup>Now in the seven plentiful years the ground brought forth abundantly. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_48"><sup>48</sup>So he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities; he laid up in every city the food of the fields which surrounded them. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_49"><sup>49</sup>Joseph gathered very much grain, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:17; Judg. 7:12; 1 Sam. 13:5">⚓</a>as the sand of the sea, until he stopped counting, for <i>it</i> <i>was</i> immeasurable.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_41_50"> <sup>50</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:20; 48:5">⚓</a>And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-Pherah priest of On, bore to him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_51"><sup>51</sup>Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: “For God has made me forget all my toil and all my <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 45:10">⚓</a>father’s house.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_52"><sup>52</sup>And the name of the second he called Ephraim: “For God has caused me to be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:6; 28:3; 49:22">⚓</a>fruitful in the land of my affliction.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_41_53"> <sup>53</sup>Then the seven years of plenty which were in the land of Egypt ended, </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_54"><sup>54</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:16; Acts 7:11">⚓</a>and the seven years of famine began to come, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:30">⚓</a>as Joseph had said. The famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_55"><sup>55</sup>So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Then Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 2:5">⚓</a>whatever he says to you, do.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_56"><sup>56</sup>The famine was over all the face of the earth, and Joseph opened all the storehouses and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:6">⚓</a>sold to the Egyptians. And the famine became severe in the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse sa_41_57"><sup>57</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 29:12">⚓</a>So all countries came to Joseph in Egypt to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:28, 37; 42:3">⚓</a>buy <i>grain,</i> because the famine was severe in all lands.<br/></span>
