<div class="title"><h1>42</h1><h3>Joseph’s Brothers Go to Egypt</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_42_1"> <sup>1</sup>When <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:12">⚓</a>Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?” </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_2"><sup>2</sup>And he said, “Indeed I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down to that place and buy for us there, that we may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:8; Ps. 33:18, 19; Is. 38:1">⚓</a>live and not die.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_42_3"> <sup>3</sup>So Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_4"><sup>4</sup>But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:38">⚓</a>“Lest some calamity befall him.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_5"><sup>5</sup>And the sons of Israel went to buy <i>grain</i> among those who journeyed, for the famine was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:10; 26:1; 41:57; Acts 7:11">⚓</a>in the land of Canaan.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_42_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now Joseph <i>was</i> governor <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:41, 55">⚓</a>over the land; and it was he who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:7–10; 41:43; Is. 60:14">⚓</a>bowed down before him with <i>their</i> faces to the earth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_7"><sup>7</sup>Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:1, 2">⚓</a>a stranger to them and spoke roughly to them. Then he said to them, “Where do you come from?”<br/> And they said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_42_8"> <sup>8</sup>So Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_9"><sup>9</sup>Then Joseph <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:5–9">⚓</a>remembered the dreams which he had dreamed about them, and said to them, “You <i>are</i> spies! You have come to see the nakedness of the land!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_42_10"> <sup>10</sup>And they said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_11"><sup>11</sup>We <i>are</i> all one man’s sons; we <i>are</i> honest <i>men;</i> your servants are not spies.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_42_12"> <sup>12</sup>But he said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_42_13"> <sup>13</sup>And they said, “Your servants <i>are</i> twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and in fact, the youngest <i>is</i> with our father today, and one <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:30; 42:32; 44:20; Lam. 5:7">⚓</a><i>is</i> no more.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_42_14"> <sup>14</sup>But Joseph said to them, “It <i>is</i> as I spoke to you, saying, ‘You <i>are</i> spies!’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_15"><sup>15</sup>In this <i>manner</i> you shall be tested: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:26; 17:55">⚓</a>By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_16"><sup>16</sup>Send one of you, and let him bring your brother; and you shall be kept in prison, that your words may be tested to see whether <i>there</i> <i>is</i> any truth in you; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, surely you <i>are</i> spies!” </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_17"><sup>17</sup>So he put them all together in prison <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:4, 7, 12">⚓</a>three days.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_42_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this and live, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:12; 39:9; Ex. 1:17; Lev. 25:43; Neh. 5:15; Prov. 1:7; 9:10">⚓</a><i>for</i> I fear God: </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_19"><sup>19</sup>If you <i>are</i> honest <i>men,</i> let one of your brothers be confined to your prison house; but you, go and carry grain for the famine of your houses. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_20"><sup>20</sup>And bring your young<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:34; 43:5; 44:23">⚓</a>est brother to me; so your words will be verified, and you shall not die.”<br/> And they did so. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_21"><sup>21</sup>Then they said to one another, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:26–28; 44:16; 45:3; Job 36:8, 9; Hos. 5:15">⚓</a>“We <i>are</i> truly guilty concerning our brother, for we saw the anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us, and we would not hear; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 21:13; Matt. 7:2">⚓</a>therefore this distress has come upon us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_42_22"> <sup>22</sup>And Reuben answered them, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:21, 22, 29">⚓</a>“Did I not speak to you, saying, ‘Do not sin against the boy’; and you would not listen? Therefore behold, his blood is now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:5, 6; 1 Kin. 2:32; 2 Chr. 24:22; Ps. 9:12; Luke 11:50, 51">⚓</a>required of us.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_23"><sup>23</sup>But they did not know that Joseph understood <i>them,</i> for he spoke to them through an interpreter. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_24"><sup>24</sup>And he turned himself away from them and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:30; 45:14, 15">⚓</a>wept. Then he returned to them again, and talked with them. And he took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:25, 30; 43:14, 23">⚓</a>Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Brothers Return to Canaan</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_42_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Joseph <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 44:1">⚓</a>gave a command to fill their sacks with grain, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:12">⚓</a>restore every man’s money to his sack, and to give them provisions for the journey. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 5:44; Rom. 12:17, 20, 21; 1 Pet. 3:9)">⚓</a>Thus he did for them. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_26"><sup>26</sup>So they loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed from there. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_27"><sup>27</sup>But as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:21, 22">⚓</a>one <i>of</i> <i>them</i> opened his sack to give his donkey feed at the encampment, he saw his money; and there it was, in the mouth of his sack. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_28"><sup>28</sup>So he said to his brothers, “My money has been restored, and there it is, in my sack!” Then their hearts failed <i>them</i> and they were afraid, saying to one another, “What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> God has done to us?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_42_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then they went to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that had happened to them, saying: </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_30"><sup>30</sup>“The man <i>who</i> <i>is</i> lord of the land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:7">⚓</a>spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_31"><sup>31</sup>But we said to him, ‘We <i>are</i> honest <i>men;</i> we are not spies. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_32"><sup>32</sup>We <i>are</i> twelve brothers, sons of our father; one <i>is</i> no <i>more,</i> and the youngest <i>is</i> with our father this day in the land of Canaan.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_33"><sup>33</sup>Then the man, the lord of the country, said to us, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:15, 19, 20">⚓</a>‘By this I will know that you <i>are</i> honest <i>men:</i> Leave one of your brothers <i>here</i> with me, take <i>food</i> <i>for</i> the famine of your households, and be gone. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_34"><sup>34</sup>And bring your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:20; 43:3, 5">⚓</a>youngest brother to me; so I shall know that you <i>are</i> not spies, but <i>that</i> you <i>are</i> honest <i>men.</i> I will grant your brother to you, and you may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:10">⚓</a>trade in the land.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_42_35"> <sup>35</sup>Then it happened as they emptied their sacks, that surprisingly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:12, 15, 21">⚓</a>each man’s bundle of money <i>was</i> in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. </span>
<span class="verse sa_42_36"><sup>36</sup>And Jacob their father said to them, “You have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:14">⚓</a>bereaved me: Joseph is no <i>more,</i> Simeon is no <i>more,</i> and you want to take <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:18; (Rom. 8:28, 31)">⚓</a>Benjamin. All these things are against me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_42_37"> <sup>37</sup>Then Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons if I do not bring him <i>back</i> to you; put him in my hands, and I will bring him back to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_42_38"> <sup>38</sup>But he said, “My son shall not go down with you, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:22; 42:13; 44:20, 28">⚓</a>his brother is dead, and he is left alone. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:4; 44:29">⚓</a>If any calamity should befall him along the way in which you go, then you would <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:35; 44:31">⚓</a>bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave.”<br/></span>
