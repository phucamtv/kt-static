<div class="title"><h1>43</h1><h3>Joseph’s Brothers Return with Benjamin</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_43_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the famine <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:54, 57; 42:5; 45:6, 11">⚓</a>severe in the land. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_2"><sup>2</sup>And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, “Go <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:2; 44:25">⚓</a>back, buy us a little food.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_3"> <sup>3</sup>But Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face unless your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:20; 43:5; 44:23">⚓</a>brother <i>is</i> with you.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_4"><sup>4</sup>If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_5"><sup>5</sup>But if you will not send <i>him,</i> we will not go down; for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother <i>is</i> with you.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_6"> <sup>6</sup>And Israel said, “Why did you deal <i>so</i> wrongfully with me <i>as</i> to tell the man whether you had still <i>another</i> brother?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_7"> <sup>7</sup>But they said, “The man asked us pointedly about ourselves and our family, saying, ‘<i>Is</i> your father still alive? Have you <i>another</i> brother?’ And we told him according to these words. Could we possibly have known that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:2; 47:19">⚓</a>live and not die, both we and you <i>and</i> also our little ones. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_9"><sup>9</sup>I myself will be surety for him; from my hand you shall require him. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:37; 44:32; Philem. 18, 19">⚓</a>If I do not bring him <i>back</i> to you and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_10"><sup>10</sup>For if we had not lingered, surely by now we would have returned this second time.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_11"> <sup>11</sup>And their father Israel said to them, “If <i>it</i> <i>must</i> <i>be</i> so, then do this: Take some of the best fruits of the land in your vessels and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:20; 33:10; 43:25, 26; (Prov. 18:16)">⚓</a>carry down a present for the man—a little <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:25; Jer. 8:22; Ezek. 27:17">⚓</a>balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_12"><sup>12</sup>Take double money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:25, 35; 43:21, 22">⚓</a>that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_13"><sup>13</sup>Take your brother also, and arise, go back to the man. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_14"><sup>14</sup>And may God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:1; 28:3; 35:11; 48:3">⚓</a>Almighty <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:21; Ps. 106:46">⚓</a>give you mercy before the man, that he may release your other brother and Benjamin. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:36; Esth. 4:16">⚓</a>If I am bereaved, I am bereaved!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_15"> <sup>15</sup>So the men took that present and Benjamin, and they took double money in their hand, and arose and went <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:1; 46:3, 6">⚓</a>down to Egypt; and they stood before Joseph. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_16"><sup>16</sup>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:2; 39:4; 44:1">⚓</a>steward of his house, “Take <i>these</i> men to my home, and slaughter an animal and make ready; for <i>these</i> men will dine with me at noon.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_17"><sup>17</sup>Then the man did as Joseph ordered, and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_18"> <sup>18</sup>Now the men were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:28">⚓</a>afraid because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> because of the money, which was returned in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may make a case against us and seize us, to take us as slaves with our donkeys.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_19"> <sup>19</sup>When they drew near to the steward of Joseph’s house, they talked with him at the door of the house, </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_20"><sup>20</sup>and said, “O sir, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:3, 10">⚓</a>we indeed came down the first time to buy food; </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_21"><sup>21</sup>but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:27, 35">⚓</a>it happened, when we came to the encampment, that we opened our sacks, and there, <i>each</i> man’s money <i>was</i> in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; so we have brought it back in our hand. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_22"><sup>22</sup>And we have brought down other money in our hands to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_23"> <sup>23</sup>But he said, “Peace <i>be</i> with you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money.” Then he brought <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:24">⚓</a>Simeon out to them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_24"> <sup>24</sup>So the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:4; 19:2; 24:32">⚓</a>gave <i>them</i> water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_25"><sup>25</sup>Then they made the present ready for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they would eat bread there.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_26"> <sup>26</sup>And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which <i>was</i> in their hand into the house, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:7, 10; 42:6; 44:14">⚓</a>bowed down before him to the earth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_27"><sup>27</sup>Then he asked them about <i>their</i> well-being, and said, “<i>Is</i> your father well, the old man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:6; 42:11, 13; 43:7; 45:3; 2 Kin. 4:26">⚓</a>of whom you spoke? <i>Is</i> he still alive?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_28"> <sup>28</sup>And they answered, “Your servant our father <i>is</i> in good health; he <i>is</i> still alive.” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:7, 10">⚓</a>And they bowed their heads down and prostrated themselves.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then he lifted his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:17, 18">⚓</a>his mother’s son, and said, “<i>Is</i> this your younger brother <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:13">⚓</a>of whom you spoke to me?” And he said, “God be gracious to you, my son.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_30"><sup>30</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:26">⚓</a>his heart yearned for his brother; so Joseph made haste and sought <i>somewhere</i> to weep. And he went into <i>his</i> chamber and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:24; 45:2, 14, 15; 46:29">⚓</a>wept there. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_31"><sup>31</sup>Then he washed his face and came out; and he restrained himself, and said, “Serve the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:25">⚓</a>bread.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_43_32"> <sup>32</sup>So they set him a place by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; because the Egyptians could not eat food with the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:12; Ex. 1:15">⚓</a>Hebrews, for that <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:34; Ex. 8:26">⚓</a>an abomination to the Egyptians. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_33"><sup>33</sup>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:36; 42:7; Deut. 21:16, 17">⚓</a>birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked in astonishment at one another. </span>
<span class="verse sa_43_34"><sup>34</sup>Then he took servings to them from before him, but Benjamin’s serving was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:24; 45:22">⚓</a>five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him.<br/></span>
