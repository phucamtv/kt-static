<div class="title"><h1>44</h1><h3>Joseph’s Cup</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_44_1"> <sup>1</sup>And he commanded the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:16">⚓</a>steward of his house, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:25">⚓</a>“Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in the mouth of his sack. </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_2"><sup>2</sup>Also put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, and his grain money.” So he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_3"><sup>3</sup>As soon as the morning dawned, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_4"><sup>4</sup>When they had gone out of the city, <i>and</i> were not <i>yet</i> far off, Joseph said to his steward, “Get up, follow the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:21">⚓</a>repaid evil for good? </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_5"><sup>5</sup><i>Is</i> not this <i>the</i> <i>one</i> from which my lord drinks, and with which he indeed practices divination? You have done evil in so doing.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_44_6"> <sup>6</sup>So he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words. </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_7"><sup>7</sup>And they said to him, “Why does my lord say these words? Far be it from us that your servants should do such a thing. </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_8"><sup>8</sup>Look, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:21">⚓</a>the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house? </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_9"><sup>9</sup>With whomever of your servants it is found, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:32">⚓</a>let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_44_10"> <sup>10</sup>And he said, “Now also <i>let</i> it <i>be</i> according to your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and you shall be blameless.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_11"><sup>11</sup>Then each man speedily let down his sack to the ground, and each opened his sack. </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_12"><sup>12</sup>So he searched. He began with the oldest and left off with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_13"><sup>13</sup>Then they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:29, 34; Num. 14:6; 2 Sam. 1:11">⚓</a>tore their clothes, and each man loaded his donkey and returned to the city.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_44_14"> <sup>14</sup>So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he <i>was</i> still there; and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:7, 10">⚓</a>fell before him on the ground. </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_15"><sup>15</sup>And Joseph said to them, “What deed <i>is</i> this you have done? Did you not know that such a man as I can certainly practice divination?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_44_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then Judah said, “What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? God has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Num. 32:23)">⚓</a>found out the iniquity of your servants; here <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 44:9">⚓</a>we are, my lord’s slaves, both we and <i>he</i> also with whom the cup was found.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_44_17"> <sup>17</sup>But he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 17:15">⚓</a>“Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the cup was found, he shall be my slave. And as for you, go up in peace to your father.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Judah Intercedes for Benjamin</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_44_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then Judah came near to him and said: “O my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s hearing, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:30, 32; Ex. 32:22">⚓</a>do not let your anger burn against your servant; for you <i>are</i> even like Pharaoh. </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_19"><sup>19</sup>My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father or a brother?’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_20"><sup>20</sup>And we said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:3; 43:8; 44:30">⚓</a>a child of <i>his</i> old age, <i>who</i> <i>is</i> young; his brother is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:38">⚓</a>dead, and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:19">⚓</a>alone is left of his mother’s children, and his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:4">⚓</a>father loves him.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_21"><sup>21</sup>Then you said to your servants, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:15, 20">⚓</a>‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_22"><sup>22</sup>And we said to my lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:3, 5">⚓</a>‘The lad cannot leave his father, for <i>if</i> he should leave his father, <i>his</i> <i>father</i> would die.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_23"><sup>23</sup>But you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_44_24"> <sup>24</sup>“So it was, when we went up to your servant my father, that we told him the words of my lord. </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_25"><sup>25</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:2">⚓</a>our father said, ‘Go back <i>and</i> buy us a little food.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_26"><sup>26</sup>But we said, ‘We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down; for we may not see the man’s face unless our youngest brother <i>is</i> with us.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_27"><sup>27</sup>Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:22–24; 35:16–18; 46:19">⚓</a>my wife bore me two sons; </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_28"><sup>28</sup>and the one went out from me, and I said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:31–35">⚓</a>“Surely he is torn to pieces”; and I have not seen him since. </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_29"><sup>29</sup>But if you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:36, 38; 44:31">⚓</a>take this one also from me, and calamity befalls him, you shall bring down my gray hair with sorrow to the grave.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_44_30"> <sup>30</sup>“Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad <i>is</i> not with us, since <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Sam. 18:1; 25:29)">⚓</a>his life is bound up in the lad’s life, </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_31"><sup>31</sup>it will happen, when he sees that the lad <i>is</i> not <i>with</i> <i>us,</i> that he will die. So your servants will bring down the gray hair of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave. </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_32"><sup>32</sup>For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:9">⚓</a>‘If I do not bring him <i>back</i> to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father forever.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_33"><sup>33</sup>Now therefore, please <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:32">⚓</a>let your servant remain instead of the lad as a slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brothers. </span>
<span class="verse sa_44_34"><sup>34</sup>For how shall I go up to my father if the lad <i>is</i> not with me, lest perhaps I see the evil that would come upon my father?”<br/></span>
