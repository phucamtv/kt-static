<div class="title"><h1>45</h1><h3>Joseph Revealed to His Brothers</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_45_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Joseph could not restrain himself before all those who stood by him, and he cried out, “Make everyone go out from me!” So no one stood with him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:13">⚓</a>while Joseph made himself known to his brothers. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_2"><sup>2</sup>And he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:30; 46:29">⚓</a>wept aloud, and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard <i>it.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_45_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then Joseph said to his brothers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:27; Acts 7:13">⚓</a>“I <i>am</i> Joseph; does my father still live?” But his brothers could not answer him, for they were dismayed in his presence. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_4"><sup>4</sup>And Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come near to me.” So they came near. Then he said: “I <i>am</i> Joseph your brother, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:28; 39:1; Ps. 105:17">⚓</a>whom you sold into Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_5"><sup>5</sup>But now, do not therefore be grieved or angry with yourselves because you sold me here; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:7, 8; 50:20; Ps. 105:16, 17">⚓</a>for God sent me before you to preserve life. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_6"><sup>6</sup>For these two years the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:1; 47:4, 13">⚓</a>famine <i>has</i> <i>been</i> in the land, and <i>there</i> <i>are</i> still five years in which <i>there</i> <i>will</i> <i>be</i> neither plowing nor harvesting. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_7"><sup>7</sup>And God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:5; 50:20">⚓</a>sent me before you to preserve a posterity for you in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_8"><sup>8</sup>So now <i>it</i> <i>was</i> not you <i>who</i> sent me here, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 8:28)">⚓</a>God; and He has made me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 17:10; Is. 22:21">⚓</a>a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:43; 42:6">⚓</a>ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_45_9"> <sup>9</sup>“Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph: “God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:28, 34; 47:1, 6; Ex. 9:26">⚓</a>You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you shall be near to me, you and your children, your children’s children, your flocks and your herds, and all that you have. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_11"><sup>11</sup>There I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:12">⚓</a>provide for you, lest you and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty; for <i>there</i> <i>are</i> still five years of famine.” ’<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_45_12"> <sup>12</sup>“And behold, your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that <i>it</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:23">⚓</a>my mouth that speaks to you. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_13"><sup>13</sup>So you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen; and you shall hurry and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:6–28; Acts 7:14">⚓</a>bring my father down here.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_45_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_15"><sup>15</sup>Moreover he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:10">⚓</a>kissed all his brothers and wept over them, and after that his brothers talked with him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_45_16"> <sup>16</sup>Now the report of it was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.” So it pleased Pharaoh and his servants well. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_17"><sup>17</sup>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and depart; go to the land of Canaan. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_18"><sup>18</sup>Bring your father and your households and come to me; I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you will eat <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:28; 47:6; Deut. 32:9–14">⚓</a>the fat of the land. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_19"><sup>19</sup>Now you are commanded—do this: Take carts out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives; bring your father and come. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_20"><sup>20</sup>Also do not be concerned about your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt <i>is</i> yours.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_45_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:19; 46:5">⚓</a>carts, according to the command of Pharaoh, and he gave them provisions for the journey. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_22"><sup>22</sup>He gave to all of them, to each man, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 5:5">⚓</a>changes of garments; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred <i>pieces</i> of silver and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:34">⚓</a>five changes of garments. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_23"><sup>23</sup>And he sent to his father these <i>things:</i> ten donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and food for his father for the journey. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_24"><sup>24</sup>So he sent his brothers away, and they departed; and he said to them, “See that you do not become troubled along the way.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_45_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then they went up out of Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_26"><sup>26</sup>And they told him, saying, “Joseph <i>is</i> still alive, and he <i>is</i> governor over all the land of Egypt.” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 29:24; Ps. 126:1; Luke 24:11, 41">⚓</a>And Jacob’s heart stood still, because he did not believe them. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_27"><sup>27</sup>But when they told him all the words which Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 15:19; Is. 40:29">⚓</a>of Jacob their father revived. </span>
<span class="verse sa_45_28"><sup>28</sup>Then Israel said, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> enough. Joseph my son <i>is</i> still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”<br/></span>
