<span class="verse sa_47_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Joseph <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:31">⚓</a>went and told Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brothers, their flocks and their herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan; and indeed they <i>are</i> in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:10; 46:28; 50:8">⚓</a>the land of Goshen.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_2"><sup>2</sup>And he took five men from among his brothers and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:13">⚓</a>presented them to Pharaoh. </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:33; Jon. 1:8">⚓</a>“What <i>is</i> your occupation?”<br/> And they said to Pharaoh, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:32, 34; Ex. 2:17, 19">⚓</a>“Your servants <i>are</i> shepherds, both we <i>and</i> also our fathers.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_4"><sup>4</sup>And they said to Pharaoh, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:13; Deut. 26:5; Ps. 105:23">⚓</a>“We have come to dwell in the land, because your servants have no pasture for their flocks, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:1; Acts 7:11">⚓</a>for the famine <i>is</i> severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:34">⚓</a>dwell in the land of Goshen.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_47_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:15; 45:10, 18; 47:11">⚓</a>The land of Egypt <i>is</i> before you. Have your father and brothers dwell in the best of the land; let them dwell <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:4">⚓</a>in the land of Goshen. And if you know <i>any</i> competent men among them, then make them chief herdsmen over my livestock.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_47_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:10; 48:15, 20; 2 Sam. 14:22; 1 Kin. 8:66; Heb. 7:7">⚓</a>blessed Pharaoh. </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_8"><sup>8</sup>Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How old <i>are</i> you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_47_9"> <sup>9</sup>And Jacob said to Pharaoh, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 39:12; (Heb. 11:9, 13)">⚓</a>“The days of the years of my pilgrimage <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:28">⚓</a>one hundred and thirty years; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Job 14:1)">⚓</a>few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 5:5; 11:10, 11; 25:7, 8; 35:28">⚓</a>they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_10"><sup>10</sup>So Jacob <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:7">⚓</a>blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_47_11"> <sup>11</sup>And Joseph situated his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:11; 12:37">⚓</a>Rameses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:6, 27">⚓</a>as Pharaoh had commanded. </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_12"><sup>12</sup>Then Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:11; 50:21">⚓</a>his father’s household with bread, according to the number in <i>their</i> families.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Joseph Deals with the Famine</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_47_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no bread in all the land; for the famine <i>was</i> very severe, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:30; Acts 7:11">⚓</a>so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine. </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:56; 42:6">⚓</a>And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_47_15"> <sup>15</sup>So when the money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us bread, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:19">⚓</a>why should we die in your presence? For the money has failed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_47_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then Joseph said, “Give your livestock, and I will give you <i>bread</i> for your livestock, if the money is gone.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_17"><sup>17</sup>So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread <i>in</i> <i>exchange</i> for the horses, the flocks, the cattle of the herds, and for the donkeys. Thus he fed them with bread <i>in</i> <i>exchange</i> for all their livestock that year.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_47_18"> <sup>18</sup>When that year had ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord that our money is gone; my lord also has our herds of livestock. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands. </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_19"><sup>19</sup>Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants of Pharaoh; give <i>us</i> seed, that we may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:8">⚓</a>live and not die, that the land may not be desolate.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_47_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then Joseph <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 32:43">⚓</a>bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaoh’s. </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_21"><sup>21</sup>And as for the people, he moved them into the cities, from <i>one</i> end of the borders of Egypt to the <i>other</i> end. </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 25:34; Ezra 7:24">⚓</a>Only the land of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:45">⚓</a>priests he did not buy; for the priests had rations <i>allotted</i> <i>to</i> <i>them</i> by Pharaoh, and they ate their rations which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their lands.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_47_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then Joseph said to the people, “Indeed I have bought you and your land this day for Pharaoh. Look, <i>here</i> <i>is</i> seed for you, and you shall sow the land. </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_24"><sup>24</sup>And it shall come to pass in the harvest that you shall give one-fifth to Pharaoh. Four-fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and for your food, for those of your households and as food for your little ones.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_47_25"> <sup>25</sup>So they said, “You have saved <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:15">⚓</a>our lives; let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_26"><sup>26</sup>And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, <i>that</i> Pharaoh should have one-fifth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:22">⚓</a>except for the land of the priests only, <i>which</i> did not become Pharaoh’s.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Joseph’s Vow to Jacob</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_47_27"> <sup>27</sup>So Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:11">⚓</a>dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions there and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:6; 26:4; 35:11; 46:3; Ex. 1:7; Deut. 26:5; Acts 7:17">⚓</a>grew and multiplied exceedingly. </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_28"><sup>28</sup>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the length of Jacob’s life was one hundred and forty-seven years. </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_29"><sup>29</sup>When the time <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:14; 1 Kin. 2:1">⚓</a>drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “Now if I have found favor in your sight, please <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:2–4">⚓</a>put your hand under my thigh, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:49; Josh. 2:14">⚓</a>deal kindly and truly with me. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:25">⚓</a>Please do not bury me in Egypt, </span>
<span class="verse sa_47_30"><sup>30</sup>but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:37">⚓</a>let me lie with my fathers; you shall carry me out of Egypt and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:29; 50:5–13; Heb. 11:21">⚓</a>bury me in their burial place.”<br/> And he said, “I will do as you have said.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_47_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then he said, “Swear to me.” And he swore to him. So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:2; 1 Kin. 1:47; Heb. 11:21">⚓</a>Israel bowed himself on the head of the bed.<br/></span>
