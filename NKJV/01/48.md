<div class="title"><h1>48</h1><h3>Jacob Blesses Joseph’s Sons</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_48_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass after these things that Joseph was told, “Indeed your father <i>is</i> sick”; and he took with him his two sons, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:51, 56; 46:20; 50:23; Josh. 14:4">⚓</a>Manasseh and Ephraim. </span>
<span class="verse sa_48_2"><sup>2</sup>And Jacob was told, “Look, your son Joseph is coming to you”; and Israel strengthened himself and sat up on the bed. </span>
<span class="verse sa_48_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Jacob said to Joseph: “God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:14; 49:25">⚓</a>Almighty appeared to me at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:13, 19; 35:6, 9">⚓</a>Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, </span>
<span class="verse sa_48_4"><sup>4</sup>and said to me, ‘Behold, I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:3">⚓</a>make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:12; Ex. 6:8">⚓</a>give this land to your descendants after you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:8">⚓</a><i>as</i> an everlasting possession.’ </span>
<span class="verse sa_48_5"><sup>5</sup>And now your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:50; 46:20; 48:8; Josh. 13:7; 14:4">⚓</a>two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, <i>are</i> mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. </span>
<span class="verse sa_48_6"><sup>6</sup>Your offspring whom you beget after them shall be yours; they will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. </span>
<span class="verse sa_48_7"><sup>7</sup>But as for me, when I came from Padan, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:9, 16, 19, 20">⚓</a>Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when <i>there</i> <i>was</i> but a little distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_48_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who <i>are</i> these?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_48_9"> <sup>9</sup>And Joseph said to his father, “They <i>are</i> my sons, whom God has given me in this <i>place.</i>”<br/> And he said, “Please bring them to me, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:4; 47:15">⚓</a>I will bless them.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_48_10"><sup>10</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:1; 1 Sam. 3:2">⚓</a>the eyes of Israel were dim with age, <i>so</i> <i>that</i> he could not see. Then Joseph brought them near him, and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:27; 45:15; 50:1">⚓</a>kissed them and embraced them. </span>
<span class="verse sa_48_11"><sup>11</sup>And Israel said to Joseph, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:26">⚓</a>“I had not thought to see your face; but in fact, God has also shown me your offspring!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_48_12"> <sup>12</sup>So Joseph brought them from beside his knees, and he bowed down with his face to the earth. </span>
<span class="verse sa_48_13"><sup>13</sup>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought <i>them</i> near him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_48_14"><sup>14</sup>Then Israel stretched out his right hand and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:15; Mark 10:16">⚓</a>laid <i>it</i> on Ephraim’s head, who <i>was</i> the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:19">⚓</a>guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh <i>was</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:51, 52; Josh. 17:1">⚓</a>firstborn. </span>
<span class="verse sa_48_15"><sup>15</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:7, 10; 49:24; (Heb. 11:21)">⚓</a>he blessed Joseph, and said:<br/>  “God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:1; 24:40; 2 Kin. 20:3">⚓</a>before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,<br/>   The God who has fed me all my life long to this day,<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_48_16">   <sup>16</sup>The Angel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:11, 15–18; 28:13–15; 31:11; (Ps. 34:22; 121:7)">⚓</a>who has redeemed me from all evil,<br/>   Bless the lads;<br/>   Let <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 9:12; Acts 15:17">⚓</a>my name be named upon them,<br/>   And the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;<br/>   And let them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:34, 37">⚓</a>grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_48_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now when Joseph saw that his father <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:14">⚓</a>laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; so he took hold of his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. </span>
<span class="verse sa_48_18"><sup>18</sup>And Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this <i>one</i> <i>is</i> the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_48_19"> <sup>19</sup>But his father refused and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:14">⚓</a>“I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 1:33, 35; Deut. 33:17">⚓</a>his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_48_20"> <sup>20</sup>So he blessed them that day, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 4:11, 12">⚓</a>“By you Israel will bless, saying, ‘May God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh!’ ” And thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_48_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:15; 46:4; 50:24">⚓</a>God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your fathers. </span>
<span class="verse sa_48_22"><sup>22</sup>Moreover <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:7; Josh. 24:32; John 4:5">⚓</a>I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took from the hand <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:28">⚓</a>of the Amorite with my sword and my bow.”<br/></span>
