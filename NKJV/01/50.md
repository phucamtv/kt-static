<span class="verse sa_50_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Joseph <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:4, 29">⚓</a>fell on his father’s face, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 13:14">⚓</a>wept over him, and kissed him. </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_2"><sup>2</sup>And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:26; 2 Chr. 16:14; Matt. 26:12; Mark 16:1; Luke 24:1; John 19:39, 40">⚓</a>embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel. </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_3"><sup>3</sup>Forty days were required for him, for such are the days required for those who are embalmed; and the Egyptians <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:34; Num. 20:29; Deut. 34:8">⚓</a>mourned for him seventy days.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_50_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 4:2">⚓</a>the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the hearing of Pharaoh, saying, </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:29–31">⚓</a>‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying; in my grave <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 16:14; Is. 22:16; Matt. 27:60">⚓</a>which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan, there you shall bury me.” Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come back.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_50_6"> <sup>6</sup>And Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_50_7"> <sup>7</sup>So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_8"><sup>8</sup>as well as all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen. </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_9"><sup>9</sup>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen, and it was a very great gathering.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_50_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which <i>is</i> beyond the Jordan, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:2">⚓</a>mourned there with a great and very solemn lamentation. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:13; Job 2:13">⚓</a>He observed seven days of mourning for his father. </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_11"><sup>11</sup>And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This <i>is</i> a deep mourning of the Egyptians.” Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which <i>is</i> beyond the Jordan.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_50_12"> <sup>12</sup>So his sons did for him just as he had commanded them. </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_13"><sup>13</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:29–31; Acts 7:16">⚓</a>his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre, which Abraham <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 23:16–20">⚓</a>bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as property for a burial place. </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_14"><sup>14</sup>And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Joseph Reassures His Brothers</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_50_15"> <sup>15</sup>When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Job 15:21)">⚓</a>they said, “Perhaps Joseph will hate us, and may actually repay us for all the evil which we did to him.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_16"><sup>16</sup>So they sent <i>messengers</i> to Joseph, saying, “Before your father died he commanded, saying, </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_17"><sup>17</sup>‘Thus you shall say to Joseph: “I beg you, please forgive the trespass of your brothers and their sin; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 28:13)">⚓</a>for they did evil to you.” ’ Now, please, forgive the trespass of the servants of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:25">⚓</a>the God of your father.” And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_50_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then his brothers also went and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:7–10; 41:43; 44:14">⚓</a>fell down before his face, and they said, “Behold, we <i>are</i> your servants.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_50_19"> <sup>19</sup>Joseph said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:5">⚓</a>“Do not be afraid, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:2; 2 Kin. 5:7">⚓</a>for <i>am</i> I in the place of God? </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:5, 7; Ps. 56:5">⚓</a>But as for you, you meant evil against me; <i>but</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 3:13–15)">⚓</a>God meant it for good, in order to bring it about as <i>it</i> <i>is</i> this day, to save many people alive. </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_21"><sup>21</sup>Now therefore, do not be afraid; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 5:44)">⚓</a>I will provide for you and your little ones.” And he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Joseph</h3></div>
<span class="verse sa_50_22"> <sup>22</sup>So Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father’s household. And Joseph lived one hundred and ten years. </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_23"><sup>23</sup>Joseph saw Ephraim’s children <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:1; Job 42:16">⚓</a>to the third <i>generation.</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:29; 32:39">⚓</a>The children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:3">⚓</a>were also brought up on Joseph’s knees.<br/></span>
<span class="verse sa_50_24"> <sup>24</sup>And Joseph said to his brethren, “I am dying; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:14; 46:4; 48:21; Ex. 3:16, 17; Josh. 3:17; Heb. 11:22">⚓</a>God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land to the land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:3; 35:12; 46:4; Ex. 6:8">⚓</a>of which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_25"><sup>25</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:29, 30; Ex. 13:19; Josh. 24:32; Acts 7:15, 16; Heb. 11:22">⚓</a>Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, “God will surely visit you, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:8; 28:13; 35:12; Deut. 1:8; 30:1–8">⚓</a>you shall carry up my <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:19">⚓</a>bones from here.” </span>
<span class="verse sa_50_26"><sup>26</sup>So Joseph died, <i>being</i> one hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.<br/></span>
