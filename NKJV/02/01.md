<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>Israel’s Suffering in Egypt</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:8–27; Ex. 6:14–16">⚓</a>these <i>are</i> the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt; each man and his household came with Jacob: </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_2"><sup>2</sup>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_3"><sup>3</sup>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_4"><sup>4</sup>Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_5"><sup>5</sup>All those who were descendants of Jacob were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:26, 27; (Deut. 10:22)">⚓</a>seventy persons (for Joseph was in Egypt <i>already</i>). </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_6"><sup>6</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:26; Acts 7:15">⚓</a>Joseph died, all his brothers, and all that generation. </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:2; 28:3; 35:11; 46:3; 47:27; 48:4; Num. 22:3; Deut. 1:10, 11; 26:5; Ps. 105:24; Acts 7:17">⚓</a>But the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, multiplied and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_1_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:18, 19">⚓</a>who did not know Joseph. </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_9"><sup>9</sup>And he said to his people, “Look, the people of the children of Israel <i>are</i> more and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:16">⚓</a>mightier than we; </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 83:3, 4">⚓</a>come, let us <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:25; (Prov. 16:25); Acts 7:19">⚓</a>deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and it happen, in the event of war, that they also join our enemies and fight against us, and <i>so</i> go up out of the land.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_11"><sup>11</sup>Therefore they set taskmasters over them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:13; Ex. 3:7; 5:6">⚓</a>to afflict them with their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:14; 2:11; 5:4–9; 6:6">⚓</a>burdens. And they built for Pharaoh <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:19; 2 Chr. 8:4">⚓</a>supply cities, Pithom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:11">⚓</a>and Raamses. </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_12"><sup>12</sup>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were in dread of the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_13"><sup>13</sup>So the Egyptians made the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:13; Ex. 5:7–19">⚓</a>serve with rigor. </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_14"><sup>14</sup>And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:23; 6:9; Num. 20:15; (Acts 7:19, 34)">⚓</a>made their lives bitter with hard bondage—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 81:6">⚓</a>in mortar, in brick, and in all manner of service in the field. All their service in which they made them serve <i>was</i> with rigor.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_1_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then the king of Egypt spoke to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:6">⚓</a>Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one <i>was</i> Shiphrah and the name of the other Puah; </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_16"><sup>16</sup>and he said, “When you do the duties of a midwife for the Hebrew women, and see <i>them</i> on the birthstools, if it <i>is</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 2:16; Acts 7:19">⚓</a>son, then you shall kill him; but if it <i>is</i> a daughter, then she shall live.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_17"><sup>17</sup>But the midwives <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:21; Prov. 16:6">⚓</a>feared God, and did not do <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 3:16, 18; Acts 4:18–20; 5:29">⚓</a>as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive. </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_18"><sup>18</sup>So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this thing, and saved the male children alive?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_1_19"> <sup>19</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:4; 2 Sam. 17:19, 20">⚓</a>the midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women <i>are</i> not like the Egyptian women; for they <i>are</i> lively and give birth before the midwives come to them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_1_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:1; Ruth 2:12; (Prov. 11:18); Eccl. 8:12; (Is. 3:10); Heb. 6:10">⚓</a>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew very mighty. </span>
<span class="verse xu_1_21"><sup>21</sup>And so it was, because the midwives feared God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:35; 2 Sam. 7:11, 13, 27, 29; 1 Kin. 2:24; 11:38; (Ps. 127:1)">⚓</a>that He provided households for them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_1_22"> <sup>22</sup>So Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:19">⚓</a>“Every son who is born you shall cast into the river, and every daughter you shall save alive.”<br/></span>
