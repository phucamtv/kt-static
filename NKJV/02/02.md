<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Moses Is Born</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:16–20; Num. 26:59; 1 Chr. 23:14">⚓</a>a man of the house of Levi went and took <i>as</i> <i>wife</i> a daughter of Levi. </span>
<span class="verse xu_2_2"><sup>2</sup>So the woman conceived and bore a son. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:20; Heb. 11:23">⚓</a>when she saw that he <i>was</i> a beautiful <i>child,</i> she hid him three months. </span>
<span class="verse xu_2_3"><sup>3</sup>But when she could no longer hide him, she took an ark of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 18:2">⚓</a>bulrushes for him, daubed it with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:10">⚓</a>asphalt and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 6:14; Is. 34:9">⚓</a>pitch, put the child in it, and laid <i>it</i> in the reeds <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 19:6">⚓</a>by the river’s bank. </span>
<span class="verse xu_2_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:20; Num. 26:59">⚓</a>And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:15; Acts 7:21">⚓</a>daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river. And her maidens walked along the riverside; and when she saw the ark among the reeds, she sent her maid to get it. </span>
<span class="verse xu_2_6"><sup>6</sup>And when she opened <i>it,</i> she saw the child, and behold, the baby wept. So she had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_2_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_2_8"> <sup>8</sup>And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” So the maiden went and called the child’s mother. </span>
<span class="verse xu_2_9"><sup>9</sup>Then Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give <i>you</i> your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him. </span>
<span class="verse xu_2_10"><sup>10</sup>And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:21">⚓</a>her son. So she called his name Moses, saying, “Because I drew him out of the water.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Moses Flees to Midian</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_2_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now it came to pass in those days, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:23, 24; Heb. 11:24–26">⚓</a>when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren and looked at their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren. </span>
<span class="verse xu_2_12"><sup>12</sup>So he looked this way and that way, and when he saw no one, he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:24, 25">⚓</a>killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. </span>
<span class="verse xu_2_13"><sup>13</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:26–28">⚓</a>when he went out the second day, behold, two Hebrew men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 25:8">⚓</a>were fighting, and he said to the one who did the wrong, “Why are you striking your companion?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_2_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:9; Acts 7:27, 28">⚓</a>“Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?”<br/> So Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:27; Heb. 11:27">⚓</a>feared and said, “Surely this thing is known!” </span>
<span class="verse xu_2_15"><sup>15</sup>When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:29; Heb. 11:27">⚓</a>Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:1">⚓</a>Midian; and he sat down by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:11; 29:2; Ex. 15:27">⚓</a>a well.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_2_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:1; 4:18; 18:12">⚓</a>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:11, 13, 19; 29:6–10; 1 Sam. 9:11">⚓</a>And they came and drew water, and they filled the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:38">⚓</a>troughs to water their father’s flock. </span>
<span class="verse xu_2_17"><sup>17</sup>Then the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:3; 1 Sam. 25:7">⚓</a>shepherds came and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:19–21">⚓</a>drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:3, 10">⚓</a>watered their flock.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_2_18"> <sup>18</sup>When they came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 10:29">⚓</a>Reuel their father, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:1; 4:18">⚓</a>he said, “How <i>is</i> <i>it</i> <i>that</i> you have come so soon today?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_2_19"> <sup>19</sup>And they said, “An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and he also drew enough water for us and watered the flock.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_2_20"> <sup>20</sup>So he said to his daughters, “And where <i>is</i> he? Why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> you have left the man? Call him, that he may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:54; 43:25">⚓</a>eat bread.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_2_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Moses was content to live with the man, and he gave <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:25; 18:2">⚓</a>Zipporah his daughter to Moses. </span>
<span class="verse xu_2_22"><sup>22</sup>And she bore <i>him</i> a son. He called his name <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:20; 18:3, 4">⚓</a>Gershom, for he said, “I have been <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 23:4; Lev. 25:23; Acts 7:29; Heb. 11:13, 14">⚓</a>a stranger in a foreign land.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_2_23"> <sup>23</sup>Now it happened <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:34">⚓</a>in the process of time that the king of Egypt died. Then the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 26:7">⚓</a>groaned because of the bondage, and they cried out; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:7, 9; James 5:4">⚓</a>their cry came up to God because of the bondage. </span>
<span class="verse xu_2_24"><sup>24</sup>So God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:5; Acts 7:34">⚓</a>heard their groaning, and God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:13; 22:16–18; 26:2–5; 28:13–15; Ps. 105:8, 42">⚓</a>remembered His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:1–3; 15:14; 17:1–14">⚓</a>covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. </span>
<span class="verse xu_2_25"><sup>25</sup>And God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:31; Luke 1:25; Acts 7:34">⚓</a>looked upon the children of Israel, and God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:7">⚓</a>acknowledged <i>them.</i><br/></span>
