<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Moses at the Burning Bush</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Moses was tending the flock of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:18">⚓</a>Jethro his father-in-law, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:16">⚓</a>the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:6; 1 Kin. 19:8">⚓</a>Horeb, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:5">⚓</a>the mountain of God. </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_2"><sup>2</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:16; Mark 12:26; Luke 20:37; Acts 7:30">⚓</a>the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush <i>was</i> not consumed. </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Moses said, “I will now turn aside and see this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:31">⚓</a>great sight, why the bush does not burn.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_3_4"> <sup>4</sup>So when the Lord saw that he turned aside to look, God called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:5; Deut. 33:16">⚓</a>to him from the midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!”<br/> And he said, “Here I am.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_3_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then He said, “Do not draw near this place. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:15; Acts 7:33">⚓</a>Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand <i>is</i> holy ground.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_6"><sup>6</sup>Moreover He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:13; Ex. 3:16; 4:5; (Matt. 22:32; Mark 12:26, 27; Luke 20:37, 38); Acts 7:32">⚓</a>“I <i>am</i> the God of your father—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:13">⚓</a>he was afraid to look upon God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_3_7"> <sup>7</sup>And the Lord said: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:23–25; Neh. 9:9; Ps. 106:44">⚓</a>“I have surely seen the oppression of My people who <i>are</i> in Egypt, and have heard their cry <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:11">⚓</a>because of their taskmasters, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:21; Ex. 2:25">⚓</a>for I know their sorrows. </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_8"><sup>8</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:13–16; 46:4; 50:24, 25">⚓</a>I have come down to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:6–8; 12:51">⚓</a>deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:27; Deut. 1:25; 8:7–9; Josh. 3:17">⚓</a>a good and large land, to a land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:17; 13:5; Jer. 11:5; Ezek. 20:6">⚓</a>flowing with milk and honey, to the place of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:19–21; Josh. 24:11">⚓</a>the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites. </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_9"><sup>9</sup>Now therefore, behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:23">⚓</a>the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:11, 13, 14">⚓</a>oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:13, 14; Ex. 12:40, 41; (Mic. 6:4); Acts 7:6, 7">⚓</a>Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_3_11"> <sup>11</sup>But Moses said to God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:10; 6:12; 1 Sam. 18:18">⚓</a>“Who <i>am</i> I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_3_12"> <sup>12</sup>So He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:3; Ex. 4:12, 15; 33:14–16; Deut. 31:23; Josh. 1:5; Is. 43:2; Rom. 8:31">⚓</a>“I will certainly be with you. And this <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:8; 19:3">⚓</a>sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_3_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then Moses said to God, “Indeed, <i>when</i> I come to the children of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they say to me, ‘What <i>is</i> His name?’ what shall I say to them?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_3_14"> <sup>14</sup>And God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 6:3; John 8:24, 28, 58; Heb. 13:8; Rev. 1:8; 4:8)">⚓</a>‘I AM has sent me to you.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_15"><sup>15</sup>Moreover God said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: ‘The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 30:4; 97:12; 102:12; 135:13; (Hos. 12:5)">⚓</a>My name forever, and this <i>is</i> My memorial to all generations.’ </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_16"><sup>16</sup>Go and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:29">⚓</a>gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, ‘The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:24; Ex. 2:25; 4:31; Ps. 33:18; Luke 1:68">⚓</a>“I have surely visited you and <i>seen</i> what is done to you in Egypt; </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_17"><sup>17</sup>and I have said <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:13–21; 46:4; 50:24, 25">⚓</a>I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.” ’ </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_18"><sup>18</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:31">⚓</a>they will heed your voice; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 5:1, 3">⚓</a>you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt; and you shall say to him, ‘The Lord God of the Hebrews has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:3, 4, 15, 16">⚓</a>met with us; and now, please, let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.’ </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_19"><sup>19</sup>But I am sure that the king of Egypt <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 5:2">⚓</a>will not let you go, no, not even by a mighty hand. </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_20"><sup>20</sup>So I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:6; 9:15">⚓</a>stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:22; Neh. 9:10; Ps. 105:27; 135:9; Jer. 32:20; Acts 7:36">⚓</a>all My wonders which I will do in its midst; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 11:1; 12:31–37">⚓</a>after that he will let you go. </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_21"><sup>21</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 11:3; 12:36; 1 Kin. 8:50; Ps. 105:37; 106:46; (Prov. 16:7)">⚓</a>I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians; and it shall be, when you go, that you shall not go empty-handed. </span>
<span class="verse xu_3_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 11:2">⚓</a>But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, namely, of her who dwells near her house, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:6">⚓</a>articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing; and you shall put <i>them</i> on your sons and on your daughters. So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 27:17; Prov. 13:22; (Ezek. 39:10)">⚓</a>you shall plunder the Egyptians.”<br/></span>
