<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Miraculous Signs for Pharaoh</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Moses answered and said, “But suppose they will not believe me or listen to my voice; suppose they say, ‘The Lord has not appeared to you.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_4_2"> <sup>2</sup>So the Lord said to him, “What <i>is</i> that in your hand?”<br/> He said, “A rod.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_4_3"> <sup>3</sup>And He said, “Cast it on the ground.” So he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_4"><sup>4</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Reach out your hand and take <i>it</i> by the tail” (and he reached out his hand and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand), </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_5"><sup>5</sup>“that they may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:31; 19:9">⚓</a>believe that the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:13; 48:15; Ex. 3:6, 15">⚓</a>Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_4_6"> <sup>6</sup>Furthermore the Lord said to him, “Now put your hand in your bosom.” And he put his hand in his bosom, and when he took it out, behold, his hand <i>was</i> leprous, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:10; 2 Kin. 5:27">⚓</a>like snow. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_7"><sup>7</sup>And He said, “Put your hand in your bosom again.” So he put his hand in his bosom again, and drew it out of his bosom, and behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:13–15; Deut. 32:39">⚓</a>it was restored like his <i>other</i> flesh. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_8"><sup>8</sup>“Then it will be, if they do not believe you, nor heed the message of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:6–13">⚓</a>first sign, that they may believe the message of the latter sign. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_9"><sup>9</sup>And it shall be, if they do not believe even these two signs, or listen to your voice, that you shall take water from the river and pour <i>it</i> on the dry <i>land.</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:19, 20">⚓</a>The water which you take from the river will become blood on the dry <i>land.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_4_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Moses said to the Lord, “O my Lord, I <i>am</i> not eloquent, neither before nor since You have spoken to Your servant; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:11; 4:1; 6:12; Jer. 1:6">⚓</a>I <i>am</i> slow of speech and slow of tongue.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_4_11"> <sup>11</sup>So the Lord said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 94:9; 146:8; Matt. 11:5; Luke 1:20, 64">⚓</a>“Who has made man’s mouth? Or who makes the mute, the deaf, the seeing, or the blind? <i>Have</i> not I, the Lord? </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_12"><sup>12</sup>Now therefore, go, and I will be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:15, 16; Deut. 18:18; Is. 50:4; Jer. 1:9; (Matt. 10:19; Mark 13:11; Luke 12:11, 12; 21:14, 15)">⚓</a>with your mouth and teach you what you shall say.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>But he said, “O my Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jon. 1:3">⚓</a>please send by the hand of whomever <i>else</i> You may send.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_4_14"> <sup>14</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:1, 33">⚓</a>the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and He said: “Is not Aaron the Levite your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:59">⚓</a>brother? I know that he can speak well. And look, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:27; 1 Sam. 10:2, 3, 5">⚓</a>he is also coming out to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_15"><sup>15</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:12, 30; 7:1, 2">⚓</a>you shall speak to him and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:5, 12; Deut. 18:18; 2 Sam. 14:3, 19; Is. 51:16; 59:21; Jer. 1:9">⚓</a>put the words in his mouth. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 5:31">⚓</a>I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you shall do. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_16"><sup>16</sup>So he shall be your spokesman to the people. And he himself shall be as a mouth for you, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:1, 2">⚓</a>you shall be to him as God. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_17"><sup>17</sup>And you shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Moses Goes to Egypt</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_4_18"> <sup>18</sup>So Moses went and returned to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:21; 3:1; 4:18">⚓</a>Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please let me go and return to my brethren who <i>are</i> in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive.”<br/> And Jethro said to Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:23; Judg. 18:6">⚓</a>“Go in peace.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_4_19"> <sup>19</sup>Now the Lord said to Moses in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:1; 18:1">⚓</a>Midian, “Go, return to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:3, 6">⚓</a>Egypt; for all the men who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:15, 23; Matt. 2:20">⚓</a>sought your life are dead.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_20"><sup>20</sup>Then Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:2–5; Acts 7:29">⚓</a>took his wife and his sons and set them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:17; 17:9; Num. 20:8, 9, 11">⚓</a>the rod of God in his hand.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_4_21"> <sup>21</sup>And the Lord said to Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you do all those <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:20; 11:9, 10">⚓</a>wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in your hand. But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:3, 13; 9:12, 35; 10:1, 20, 27; 14:4, 8; Deut. 2:30; Josh. 11:20; 1 Sam. 6:6; Is. 63:17; John 12:40; Rom. 9:18">⚓</a>I will harden his heart, so that he will not let the people go. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_22"><sup>22</sup>Then you shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 5:1">⚓</a>say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 63:16; 64:8; Hos. 11:1; (Rom. 9:4; 2 Cor. 6:16, 18)">⚓</a>“Israel <i>is</i> My son, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 31:9; (James 1:18)">⚓</a>My firstborn. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_23"><sup>23</sup>So I say to you, let My son go that he may serve Me. But if you refuse to let him go, indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 11:5; 12:29; Ps. 105:36; 135:8; 136:10">⚓</a>I will kill your son, your firstborn.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_4_24"> <sup>24</sup>And it came to pass on the way, at the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:27">⚓</a>encampment, that the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:18; 5:3; Num. 22:22">⚓</a>met him and sought to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:14">⚓</a>kill him. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_25"><sup>25</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:21; 18:2">⚓</a>Zipporah took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:14; Josh. 5:2, 3">⚓</a>a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast <i>it</i> at <i>Moses’</i> feet, and said, “Surely you <i>are</i> a husband of blood to me!” </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_26"><sup>26</sup>So He let him go. Then she said, “<i>You</i> <i>are</i> a husband of blood!”—because of the circumcision.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_4_27"> <sup>27</sup>And the Lord said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:14">⚓</a>to meet Moses.” So he went and met him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:1; 18:5; 24:13">⚓</a>on the mountain of God, and kissed him. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_28"><sup>28</sup>So Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:15, 16">⚓</a>told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him, and all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:8, 9">⚓</a>signs which He had commanded him. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_29"><sup>29</sup>Then Moses and Aaron <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:16; 12:21">⚓</a>went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:15, 16">⚓</a>And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken to Moses. Then he did the signs in the sight of the people. </span>
<span class="verse xu_4_31"><sup>31</sup>So the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:18; 4:8, 9; 19:9">⚓</a>believed; and when they heard that the Lord had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:24; Ex. 3:16">⚓</a>visited the children of Israel and that He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:25; 3:7">⚓</a>had looked on their affliction, then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:26; Ex. 12:27; 1 Chr. 29:20">⚓</a>they bowed their heads and worshiped.<br/></span>
