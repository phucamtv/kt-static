<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>First Encounter with Pharaoh</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh, “Thus says the Lord God of Israel: ‘Let My people go, that they may hold <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:18; 7:16; 10:9">⚓</a>a feast to Me in the wilderness.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_5_2"> <sup>2</sup>And Pharaoh said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:35; 2 Chr. 32:14; Job 21:15">⚓</a>“Who <i>is</i> the Lord, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:19; 7:14">⚓</a>nor will I let Israel go.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_5_3"> <sup>3</sup>So they said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:18; 7:16">⚓</a>“The God of the Hebrews has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:24; Num. 23:3">⚓</a>met with us. Please, let us go three days’ journey into the desert and sacrifice to the Lord our God, lest He fall upon us with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:15">⚓</a>pestilence or with the sword.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_5_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you take the people from their work? Get <i>back</i> to your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:11; 2:11; 6:6">⚓</a>labor.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_5_5"><sup>5</sup>And Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:7, 9">⚓</a>many now, and you make them rest from their labor!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_5_6"> <sup>6</sup>So the same day Pharaoh commanded the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:11; 3:7; 5:10, 13, 14">⚓</a>taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying, </span>
<span class="verse xu_5_7"><sup>7</sup>“You shall no longer give the people straw to make <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:14">⚓</a>brick as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves. </span>
<span class="verse xu_5_8"><sup>8</sup>And you shall lay on them the quota of bricks which they made before. You shall not reduce it. For they are idle; therefore they cry out, saying, ‘Let us go <i>and</i> sacrifice to our God.’ </span>
<span class="verse xu_5_9"><sup>9</sup>Let more work be laid on the men, that they may labor in it, and let them not regard false words.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_5_10"> <sup>10</sup>And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out and spoke to the people, saying, “Thus says Pharaoh: ‘I will not give you straw. </span>
<span class="verse xu_5_11"><sup>11</sup>Go, get yourselves straw where you can find it; yet none of your work will be reduced.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse xu_5_12"><sup>12</sup>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. </span>
<span class="verse xu_5_13"><sup>13</sup>And the taskmasters forced <i>them</i> to hurry, saying, “Fulfill your work, <i>your</i> daily quota, as when there was straw.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_5_14"><sup>14</sup>Also the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 5:6">⚓</a>officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 10:24">⚓</a>beaten <i>and</i> were asked, “Why have you not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today, as before?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_5_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, “Why are you dealing thus with your servants? </span>
<span class="verse xu_5_16"><sup>16</sup>There is no straw given to your servants, and they say to us, ‘Make brick!’ And indeed your servants <i>are</i> beaten, but the fault <i>is</i> in your <i>own</i> people.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_5_17"> <sup>17</sup>But he said, “You <i>are</i> idle! Idle! Therefore you say, ‘Let us go <i>and</i> sacrifice to the Lord.’ </span>
<span class="verse xu_5_18"><sup>18</sup>Therefore go now <i>and</i> work; for no straw shall be given you, yet you shall deliver the quota of bricks.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_5_19"><sup>19</sup>And the officers of the children of Israel saw <i>that</i> they <i>were</i> in trouble after it was said, “You shall not reduce <i>any</i> bricks from your daily quota.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_5_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then, as they came out from Pharaoh, they met Moses and Aaron who stood there to meet them. </span>
<span class="verse xu_5_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:9; 14:11; 15:24; 16:2">⚓</a>And they said to them, “Let the Lord look on you and judge, because you have made us abhorrent in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel’s Deliverance Assured</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_5_22"> <sup>22</sup>So Moses returned to the Lord and said, “Lord, why have You brought trouble on this people? Why <i>is</i> it You have sent me? </span>
<span class="verse xu_5_23"><sup>23</sup>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people; neither have You delivered Your people at all.”<br/></span>
