<span class="verse xu_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>So the Lord said to Moses: “See, I have made you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:16; Jer. 1:10">⚓</a><i>as</i> God to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:15, 16">⚓</a>your prophet. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_2"><sup>2</sup>You <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:15; Deut. 18:18">⚓</a>shall speak all that I command you. And Aaron your brother shall tell Pharaoh to send the children of Israel out of his land. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_3"><sup>3</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:21; 9:12">⚓</a>I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 11:9; Acts 7:36">⚓</a>multiply My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:7; Deut. 4:34">⚓</a>signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_4"><sup>4</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:19, 20; 10:1; 11:9">⚓</a>Pharaoh will not heed you, so <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:14">⚓</a>that I may lay My hand on Egypt and bring My armies <i>and</i> My people, the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:6; 12:12">⚓</a>by great judgments. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_5"><sup>5</sup>And the Egyptians <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:17; 8:22; 14:4, 18; Ps. 9:16">⚓</a>shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord, when I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:15">⚓</a>stretch out My hand on Egypt and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:20; 6:6; 12:51">⚓</a>bring out the children of Israel from among them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_7_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then Moses and Aaron <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:2">⚓</a>did <i>so;</i> just as the Lord commanded them, so they did. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_7"><sup>7</sup>And Moses <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:5; 31:2; 34:7; Acts 7:23, 30">⚓</a>eighty years old and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:39">⚓</a>Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Aaron’s Miraculous Rod</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_7_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_9"><sup>9</sup>“When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 10:1; Is. 7:11; John 2:18; 6:30">⚓</a>‘Show a miracle for yourselves,’ then you shall say to Aaron, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:2, 3, 17">⚓</a>‘Take your rod and cast <i>it</i> before Pharaoh, <i>and</i> let it become a serpent.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_10"><sup>10</sup>So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, just <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:9">⚓</a>as the Lord commanded. And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:3">⚓</a>became a serpent.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_7_11"> <sup>11</sup>But Pharaoh also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:8">⚓</a>called the wise men and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:2; 2 Tim. 3:8">⚓</a>the sorcerers; so the magicians of Egypt, they also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:22; 8:7, 18; 2 Tim. 3:9; Rev. 13:13, 14">⚓</a>did in like manner with their enchantments. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_12"><sup>12</sup>For every man threw down his rod, and they became serpents. But Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_13"><sup>13</sup>And Pharaoh’s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, as the Lord had said.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The First Plague: Waters Become Blood</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_7_14"> <sup>14</sup>So the Lord said to Moses: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:15; 10:1, 20, 27">⚓</a>“Pharaoh’s heart <i>is</i> hard; he refuses to let the people go. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_15"><sup>15</sup>Go to Pharaoh in the morning, when he goes out to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:5; 8:20">⚓</a>water, and you shall stand by the river’s bank to meet him; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:2, 3; 7:10">⚓</a>the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take in your hand. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_16"><sup>16</sup>And you shall say to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:13, 18; 4:22">⚓</a>‘The Lord God of the Hebrews has sent me to you, saying, “Let My people go, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:12, 18; 4:23; 5:1, 3; 8:1">⚓</a>that they may serve Me in the wilderness”; but indeed, until now you would not hear! </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_17"><sup>17</sup>Thus says the Lord: “By this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 5:2; 7:5; 10:2; Ps. 9:16; Ezek. 25:17">⚓</a>you shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord. Behold, I will strike the waters which <i>are</i> in the river with the rod that <i>is</i> in my hand, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:9; 7:20">⚓</a>they shall be turned <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 11:6; 16:4, 6">⚓</a>to blood. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_18"><sup>18</sup>And the fish that <i>are</i> in the river shall die, the river shall stink, and the Egyptians will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:24">⚓</a>loathe to drink the water of the river.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_7_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:5, 6, 16; 9:22; 10:12, 21; 14:21, 26">⚓</a>stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their streams, over their rivers, over their ponds, and over all their pools of water, that they may become blood. And there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in <i>buckets</i> <i>of</i> wood and <i>pitchers</i> <i>of</i> stone.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_20"><sup>20</sup>And Moses and Aaron did so, just as the Lord commanded. So he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:5">⚓</a>lifted up the rod and struck the waters that <i>were</i> in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants. And all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:44; 105:29, 30">⚓</a>waters that <i>were</i> in the river were turned to blood. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_21"><sup>21</sup>The fish that <i>were</i> in the river died, the river stank, and the Egyptians <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:18">⚓</a>could not drink the water of the river. So there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_7_22"> <sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:11">⚓</a>Then the magicians of Egypt did <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:7">⚓</a>so with their enchantments; and Pharaoh’s heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:19; 7:3">⚓</a>as the Lord had said. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_23"><sup>23</sup>And Pharaoh turned and went into his house. Neither was his heart moved by this. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_24"><sup>24</sup>So all the Egyptians dug all around the river for water to drink, because they could not drink the water of the river. </span>
<span class="verse xu_7_25"><sup>25</sup>And seven days passed after the Lord had struck the river.<br/></span>
