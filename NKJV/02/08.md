<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>The Second Plague: Frogs</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>And the Lord spoke to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the Lord: “Let My people go, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:12, 18; 4:23; 5:1, 3">⚓</a>that they may serve Me. </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_2"><sup>2</sup>But if you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:14; 9:2">⚓</a>refuse to let <i>them</i> go, behold, I will smite all your territory with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 16:13">⚓</a>frogs. </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_3"><sup>3</sup>So the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, into your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:30">⚓</a>bedroom, on your bed, into the houses of your servants, on your people, into your ovens, and into your kneading bowls. </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_4"><sup>4</sup>And the frogs shall come up on you, on your people, and on all your servants.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_8_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Moses, “Say to Aaron, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:19">⚓</a>‘Stretch out your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_6"><sup>6</sup>So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:45; 105:30">⚓</a>the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:11, 22">⚓</a>And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_8_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:28; 9:28; 10:17; Num. 21:7; 1 Kin. 13:6">⚓</a>“Entreat the Lord that He may take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 10:8, 24">⚓</a>go, that they may sacrifice to the Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_8_9"> <sup>9</sup>And Moses said to Pharaoh, “Accept the honor of saying when I shall intercede for you, for your servants, and for your people, to destroy the frogs from you and your houses, <i>that</i> they may remain in the river only.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_8_10"> <sup>10</sup>So he said, “Tomorrow.” And he said, “<i>Let</i> <i>it</i> <i>be</i> according to your word, that you may know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:14; 15:11; Deut. 4:35, 39; 33:26; 2 Sam. 7:22; 1 Chr. 17:20; Ps. 86:8; Is. 46:9; (Jer. 10:6, 7)">⚓</a><i>there</i> <i>is</i> no one like the Lord our God. </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_11"><sup>11</sup>And the frogs shall depart from you, from your houses, from your servants, and from your people. They shall remain in the river only.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_8_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. And Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:30; 9:33; 10:18; 32:11; (James 5:16–18)">⚓</a>cried out to the Lord concerning the frogs which He had brought against Pharaoh. </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_13"><sup>13</sup>So the Lord did according to the word of Moses. And the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courtyards, and out of the fields. </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_14"><sup>14</sup>They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank. </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_15"><sup>15</sup>But when Pharaoh saw that there was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 8:11">⚓</a>relief, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:14, 22; 9:34; 1 Sam. 6:6">⚓</a>he hardened his heart and did not heed them, as the Lord had said.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Third Plague: Lice</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_8_16"> <sup>16</sup>So the Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the land, so that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_17"><sup>17</sup>And they did so. For Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and struck the dust of the earth, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:31">⚓</a>it became lice on man and beast. All the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_8_18"> <sup>18</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:11, 12; 8:7">⚓</a>the magicians so worked with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 5:8; 2 Tim. 3:8, 9">⚓</a>could not. So there were lice on man and beast. </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_19"><sup>19</sup>Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:5; 10:7; 1 Sam. 6:3, 9; Ps. 8:3; Luke 11:20">⚓</a>the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:15">⚓</a>heart grew hard, and he did not heed them, just as the Lord had said.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Fourth Plague: Flies</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_8_20"> <sup>20</sup>And the Lord said to Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:15; 9:13">⚓</a>“Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he comes out to the water. Then say to him, ‘Thus says the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:18; 4:23; 5:1, 3; 8:1">⚓</a>“Let My people go, that they may serve Me. </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_21"><sup>21</sup>Or else, if you will not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms <i>of</i> <i>flies</i> on you and your servants, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms <i>of</i> <i>flies,</i> and also the ground on which they <i>stand.</i></span>
<span class="verse xu_8_22"><sup>22</sup>And in that day <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:4, 6, 26; 10:23; 11:6, 7; 12:13">⚓</a>I will set apart the land of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:8">⚓</a>Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms <i>of</i> <i>flies</i> shall be there, in order that you may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:5, 17; 10:2; 14:4">⚓</a>know that I <i>am</i> the Lord in the midst of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:29">⚓</a>land. </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_23"><sup>23</sup>I will make a difference between My people and your people. Tomorrow this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:8">⚓</a>sign shall be.” ’ ” </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_24"><sup>24</sup>And the Lord did so. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:45; 105:31">⚓</a>Thick swarms <i>of</i> <i>flies</i> came into the house of Pharaoh, <i>into</i> his servants’ houses, and into all the land of Egypt. The land was corrupted because of the swarms <i>of</i> <i>flies.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_8_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_8_26"> <sup>26</sup>And Moses said, “It is not right to do so, for we would be sacrificing <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:32; 46:34; (Deut. 7:25, 26; 12:31)">⚓</a>the abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God. If we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, then will they not stone us? </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_27"><sup>27</sup>We will go <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:18; 5:3">⚓</a>three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:12">⚓</a>He will command us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_8_28"> <sup>28</sup>So Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:8, 15, 29, 32; 9:28; 1 Kin. 13:6">⚓</a>Intercede for me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_8_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then Moses said, “Indeed I am going out from you, and I will entreat the Lord, that the swarms <i>of</i> <i>flies</i> may depart tomorrow from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. But let Pharaoh not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:8, 15">⚓</a>deal deceitfully anymore in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_8_30"> <sup>30</sup>So Moses went out from Pharaoh and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:12">⚓</a>entreated the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_31"><sup>31</sup>And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; He removed the swarms <i>of</i> <i>flies</i> from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one remained. </span>
<span class="verse xu_8_32"><sup>32</sup>But Pharaoh <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:21; 8:8, 15; Ps. 52:2">⚓</a>hardened his heart at this time also; neither would he let the people go.<br/></span>
