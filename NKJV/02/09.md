<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>The Fifth Plague: Livestock Diseased</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:23; 8:1">⚓</a>“Go in to Pharaoh and tell him, ‘Thus says the Lord God of the Hebrews: “Let My people go, that they may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:16">⚓</a>serve Me. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_2"><sup>2</sup>For if you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:2">⚓</a>refuse to let <i>them</i> go, and still hold them, </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_3"><sup>3</sup>behold, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:4; 1 Sam. 5:6; Ps. 39:10; Acts 13:11">⚓</a>hand of the Lord will be on your cattle in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the oxen, and on the sheep—a very severe pestilence. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_4"><sup>4</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:22">⚓</a>the Lord will make a difference between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt. So nothing shall die of all <i>that</i> belongs to the children of Israel.” ’ ” </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_5"><sup>5</sup>Then the Lord appointed a set time, saying, “Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the land.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_9_6"> <sup>6</sup>So the Lord did this thing on the next day, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:19, 20, 25; Ps. 78:48, 50">⚓</a>all the livestock of Egypt died; but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not one died. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_7"><sup>7</sup>Then Pharaoh sent, and indeed, not even one of the livestock of the Israelites was dead. But the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:14; 8:32">⚓</a>heart of Pharaoh became hard, and he did not let the people go.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Sixth Plague: Boils</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_9_8"> <sup>8</sup>So the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Take for yourselves handfuls of ashes from a furnace, and let Moses scatter it toward the heavens in the sight of Pharaoh. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_9"><sup>9</sup>And it will become fine dust in all the land of Egypt, and it will cause <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:27; Rev. 16:2">⚓</a>boils that break out in sores on man and beast throughout all the land of Egypt.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_10"><sup>10</sup>Then they took ashes from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses scattered <i>them</i> toward heaven. And <i>they</i> caused <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:27">⚓</a>boils that break out in sores on man and beast. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_11"><sup>11</sup>And the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 8:18, 19; 2 Tim. 3:9)">⚓</a>magicians could not stand before Moses because of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:27; Job 2:7; Rev. 16:1, 2">⚓</a>boils, for the boils were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_12"><sup>12</sup>But the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh; and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:13">⚓</a>did not heed them, just <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:21">⚓</a>as the Lord had spoken to Moses.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Seventh Plague: Hail</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_9_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:20">⚓</a>“Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘Thus says the Lord God of the Hebrews: “Let My people go, that they may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:1">⚓</a>serve Me, </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_14"><sup>14</sup>for at this time I will send all My plagues to your very heart, and on your servants and on your people, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:10; Deut. 3:24; 2 Sam. 7:22; 1 Chr. 17:20; Ps. 86:8; Is. 45:5–8; 46:9; Jer. 10:6, 7">⚓</a>that you may know that <i>there</i> <i>is</i> none like Me in all the earth. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_15"><sup>15</sup>Now if I had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:20; 7:5">⚓</a>stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 5:3">⚓</a>pestilence, then you would have been cut off from the earth. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_16"><sup>16</sup>But indeed for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:17; Prov. 16:4; (Rom. 9:17, 18; 1 Pet. 2:8, 9)">⚓</a>this <i>purpose</i> I have raised you up, that I may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:4, 5; 10:1; 11:9; 14:17">⚓</a>show My power <i>in</i> you, and that My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:43">⚓</a>name may be declared in all the earth. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_17"><sup>17</sup>As yet you exalt yourself against My people in that you will not let them go. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_18"><sup>18</sup>Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause very heavy hail to rain down, such as has not been in Egypt since its founding until now. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_19"><sup>19</sup>Therefore send now <i>and</i> gather your livestock and all that you have in the field, for the hail shall come down on every man and every animal which is found in the field and is not brought home; and they shall die.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_9_20"> <sup>20</sup>He who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:17; 14:31; (Prov. 13:13)">⚓</a>feared the word of the Lord among the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:19; 10:7">⚓</a>servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his livestock flee to the houses. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_21"><sup>21</sup>But he who did not regard the word of the Lord left his servants and his livestock in the field.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_9_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 16:21">⚓</a>hail in all the land of Egypt—on man, on beast, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_23"><sup>23</sup>And Moses stretched out his rod toward heaven; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:24; Josh. 10:11; Ps. 18:13; 78:47; 105:32; 148:8; Is. 30:30; Ezek. 38:22; Rev. 8:7">⚓</a>the Lord sent thunder and hail, and fire darted to the ground. And the Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_24"><sup>24</sup>So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, so very heavy that there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_25"><sup>25</sup>And the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:19; Ps. 78:47, 48; 105:32, 33">⚓</a>hail struck throughout the whole land of Egypt, all that <i>was</i> in the field, both man and beast; and the hail struck every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_26"><sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:22, 23; 9:4, 6; 10:23; 11:7; 12:13; Is. 32:18, 19">⚓</a>Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel <i>were,</i> there was no hail.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_9_27"> <sup>27</sup>And Pharaoh sent and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:8">⚓</a>called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:34; 10:16, 17">⚓</a>“I have sinned this time. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 12:6; Ps. 129:4; 145:17; Lam. 1:18">⚓</a>The Lord<i>is</i> righteous, and my people and I <i>are</i> wicked. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_28"><sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:8, 28; 10:17; Acts 8:24">⚓</a>Entreat the Lord, that there may be no <i>more</i> mighty thundering and hail, for <i>it</i> <i>is</i> enough. I will let you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:25; 10:8, 24">⚓</a>go, and you shall stay no longer.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_9_29"> <sup>29</sup>So Moses said to him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:22, 38; Ps. 143:6; Is. 1:15">⚓</a>spread out my hands to the Lord; the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, that you may know that the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:22; 19:5; 20:11; Ps. 24:1; 1 Cor. 10:26, 28">⚓</a>earth <i>is</i> the Lord’s. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_30"><sup>30</sup>But as for you and your servants, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:29; (Is. 26:10)">⚓</a>I know that you will not yet fear the Lord God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_9_31"> <sup>31</sup>Now the flax and the barley were struck, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:22; 2:23">⚓</a>for the barley <i>was</i> in the head and the flax <i>was</i> in bud. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_32"><sup>32</sup>But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they <i>are</i> late crops.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_9_33"> <sup>33</sup>So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:12; 9:29">⚓</a>spread out his hands to the Lord; then the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_34"><sup>34</sup>And when Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had ceased, he sinned yet more; and he hardened his heart, he and his servants. </span>
<span class="verse xu_9_35"><sup>35</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:21">⚓</a>the heart of Pharaoh was hard; neither would he let the children of Israel go, as the Lord had spoken by Moses.<br/></span>
