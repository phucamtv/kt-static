<span class="verse xu_12_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 11:28)">⚓</a>Moses called for all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:16">⚓</a>elders of Israel and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:3; Num. 9:4; Josh. 5:10; 2 Kin. 23:21; Ezra 6:20; Mark 14:12–16">⚓</a>“Pick out and take lambs for yourselves according to your families, and kill the Passover <i>lamb.</i></span>

<span class="verse xu_12_25"><sup>25</sup>It will come to pass when you come to the land which the Lord will give you, j<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:8, 17">⚓</a>ust as He promised, that you shall keep this service. </span>

<span class="verse xu_12_28"><sup>28</sup>Then the children of Israel went away and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 11:28)">⚓</a>did <i>so;</i> just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.<br/></span>

<span class="verse xu_12_30"><sup>30</sup>So Pharaoh rose in the night, he, all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for <i>there</i> <i>was</i> not a house where <i>there</i> <i>was</i> not one dead.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Exodus</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_12_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 10:28, 29">⚓</a>called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, “Rise, go out from among my people, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:25; 11:1">⚓</a>both you and the children of Israel.

<span class="verse xu_12_34"><sup>34</sup>So the people took their dough before it was leavened, having their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulders. </span>
<span class="verse xu_12_35"><sup>35</sup>Now the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, and they had asked from the Egyptians <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:21, 22; 11:2, 3; Ps. 105:37">⚓</a>articles of silver, articles of gold, and clothing. </span>
<span class="verse xu_12_36"><sup>36</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:21">⚓</a>And the Lord had given the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they granted them <i>what</i> <i>they</i> <i>requested.</i> Thus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:14">⚓</a>they plundered the Egyptians.<br/></span>

<span class="verse xu_12_38"><sup>38</sup>A <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:4">⚓</a>mixed multitude went up with them also, and flocks and herds—a great deal of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:3; Num. 20:19; 32:1; Deut. 3:19">⚓</a>livestock. </span>
<span class="verse xu_12_39"><sup>39</sup>And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they had brought out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:1; 11:1; 12:31–33">⚓</a>they were driven out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared provisions for themselves.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_12_40"> <sup>40</sup>Now the sojourn of the children of Israel who lived in Egypt <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:13, 16; Acts 7:6; Gal. 3:17">⚓</a>four hundred and thirty years. </span>
