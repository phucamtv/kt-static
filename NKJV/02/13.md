<span class="verse xu_13_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God did not lead them <i>by</i> way of the land of the Philistines, although that <i>was</i> near; for God said, “Lest perhaps the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:11; Num. 14:1–4">⚓</a>change their minds when they see war, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:16">⚓</a>return to Egypt.” </span>
