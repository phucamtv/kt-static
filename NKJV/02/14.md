<span class="verse xu_14_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_2"><sup>2</sup>“Speak to the children of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:18">⚓</a>that they turn and camp before <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:7">⚓</a>Pi Hahiroth, between <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 44:1">⚓</a>Migdol and the sea, opposite Baal Zephon; you shall camp before it by the sea. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_3"><sup>3</sup>For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 71:11">⚓</a>‘They <i>are</i> bewildered by the land; the wilderness has closed them in.’ </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_4"><sup>4</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:21; 7:3; 14:17">⚓</a>I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, so that he will pursue them; and I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:16; 14:17, 18, 23; Rom. 9:17, 22, 23">⚓</a>will gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:5; 14:25">⚓</a>that the Egyptians may know that I <i>am</i> the Lord.” And they did so.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_14_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:25">⚓</a>the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people; and they said, “Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?” </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_6"><sup>6</sup>So he made ready his chariot and took his people with him. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_7"><sup>7</sup>Also, he took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:4">⚓</a>six hundred choice chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt with captains over every one of them. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_8"><sup>8</sup>And the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:4">⚓</a>hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:1; 13:9; Num. 33:3; Acts 13:17">⚓</a>the children of Israel went out with boldness. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_9"><sup>9</sup>So the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:9; Josh. 24:6">⚓</a>Egyptians pursued them, all the horses <i>and</i> chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and overtook them camping by the sea beside Pi Hahiroth, before Baal Zephon.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_14_10"> <sup>10</sup>And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them. So they were very afraid, and the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:7; Neh. 9:9; Ps. 34:17; 107:6">⚓</a>cried out to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 5:21; 15:24; 16:2; 17:3; Num. 14:2, 3; 20:3; Ps. 106:7, 8">⚓</a>Then they said to Moses, “Because <i>there</i> <i>were</i> no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you so dealt with us, to bring us up out of Egypt? </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 5:21; 6:9">⚓</a><i>Is</i> this not the word that we told you in Egypt, saying, ‘Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’? For <i>it</i> <i>would</i> <i>have</i> <i>been</i> better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_14_13"> <sup>13</sup>And Moses said to the people, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:1; 46:3; Ex. 20:20; 2 Chr. 20:15, 17; Is. 41:10, 13, 14">⚓</a>“Do not be afraid. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 46:10, 11">⚓</a>Stand still, and see the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:30; 15:2">⚓</a>salvation of the Lord, which He will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:68">⚓</a>see again no more forever. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:25; 15:3; Deut. 1:30; 3:22; Josh. 10:14, 42; 23:2; 2 Chr. 20:29; Neh. 4:20; Is. 31:4">⚓</a>The Lord will fight for you, and you shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 30:15)">⚓</a>hold your peace.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_14_15"> <sup>15</sup>And the Lord said to Moses, “Why do you cry to Me? Tell the children of Israel to go forward. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_16"><sup>16</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:17, 20; 7:19; 14:21, 26; 17:5, 6, 9; Num. 20:8, 9, 11; Is. 10:26">⚓</a>lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it. And the children of Israel shall go on dry <i>ground</i> through the midst of the sea. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_17"><sup>17</sup>And I indeed will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:8">⚓</a>harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them. So I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:4">⚓</a>gain honor over Pharaoh and over all his army, his chariots, and his horsemen. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_18"><sup>18</sup>Then the Egyptians shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord, when I have gained honor for Myself over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_14_19"> <sup>19</sup>And the Angel of God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:21, 22; (Is. 63:9)">⚓</a>who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud went from before them and stood behind them. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_20"><sup>20</sup>So it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. Thus it was a cloud and darkness <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>one,</i> and it gave light by night <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>other,</i> so that the one did not come near the other all that night.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_14_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go <i>back</i> by a strong east wind all that night, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 66:6; 106:9; 136:13, 14">⚓</a>made the sea into dry <i>land,</i> and the waters were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:8; Josh. 3:16; 4:23; Neh. 9:11; Ps. 74:13; 78:13; 114:3, 5; Is. 63:12, 13">⚓</a>divided. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_22"><sup>22</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:19; Josh. 3:17; 4:22; Neh. 9:11; Ps. 66:6; 78:13; Is. 63:13; 1 Cor. 10:1; Heb. 11:29">⚓</a>the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry <i>ground,</i> and the waters <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:29; 15:8; Hab. 3:10">⚓</a>a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_23"><sup>23</sup>And the Egyptians pursued and went after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_14_24"> <sup>24</sup>Now it came to pass, in the morning <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:19">⚓</a>watch, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:21">⚓</a>the Lord looked down upon the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud, and He troubled the army of the Egyptians. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_25"><sup>25</sup>And He took off their chariot wheels, so that they drove them with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from the face of Israel, for the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:5; 14:4, 14, 18">⚓</a>fights for them against the Egyptians.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_14_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_27"><sup>27</sup>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and when the morning appeared, the sea <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 4:18">⚓</a>returned to its full depth, while the Egyptians were fleeing into it. So the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:1, 7; Deut. 11:4; Neh. 9:11; Ps. 78:53; Heb. 11:29">⚓</a>overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_28"><sup>28</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:53; 106:11">⚓</a>the waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, <i>and</i> all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them. Not so much as one of them remained. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_29"><sup>29</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:22; Ps. 66:6; 78:52, 53; Is. 11:15">⚓</a>the children of Israel had walked on dry <i>land</i> in the midst of the sea, and the waters <i>were</i> a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_14_30"> <sup>30</sup>So the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:13; Ps. 106:8, 10; Is. 63:8, 11">⚓</a>saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 58:10; 59:10">⚓</a>saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. </span>
<span class="verse xu_14_31"><sup>31</sup>Thus Israel saw the great work which the Lord had done in Egypt; so the people feared the Lord, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:31; 19:9; Ps. 106:12; John 2:11; 11:45">⚓</a>believed the Lord and His servant Moses.<br/></span>
