<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>Bread from Heaven</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:10, 11; Ezek. 30:15">⚓</a>journeyed from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:6, 51; 19:1">⚓</a>Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they departed from the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_2"><sup>2</sup>Then the whole congregation of the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:11; 15:24; Ps. 106:25; 1 Cor. 10:10">⚓</a>complained against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_3"><sup>3</sup>And the children of Israel said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:3; Num. 14:2, 3; 20:3; Lam. 4:9">⚓</a>“Oh, that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:4, 5">⚓</a>when we sat by the pots of meat <i>and</i> when we ate bread to the full! For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_16_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:15; Ps. 78:23–25; 105:40; (John 6:31–35); 1 Cor. 10:3">⚓</a>bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every day, that I may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:25; Deut. 8:2, 16">⚓</a>test them, whether they will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:22">⚓</a>walk in My law or not. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_5"><sup>5</sup>And it shall be on the sixth day that they shall prepare what they bring in, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:22, 29; Lev. 25:21">⚓</a>it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_16_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:7">⚓</a>“At evening you shall know that the Lord has brought you out of the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_7"><sup>7</sup>And in the morning you shall see <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:10, 12; Is. 35:2; 40:5; John 11:4, 40">⚓</a>the glory of the Lord; for He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:27; 17:5">⚓</a>hears your complaints against the Lord. But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:11">⚓</a>what <i>are</i> we, that you complain against us?” </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_8"><sup>8</sup>Also Moses said, “<i>This</i> <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> <i>seen</i> when the Lord gives you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning bread to the full; for the Lord hears your complaints which you make against Him. And what <i>are</i> we? Your complaints <i>are</i> not against us but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:7; Luke 10:16; (Rom. 13:2); 1 Thess. 4:8">⚓</a>against the Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_16_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then Moses spoke to Aaron, “Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:16">⚓</a>‘Come near before the Lord, for He has heard your complaints.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_10"><sup>10</sup>Now it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:21; 16:7; Num. 16:19; 1 Kin. 8:10">⚓</a>appeared in the cloud.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_16_11"> <sup>11</sup>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:8; Num. 14:27">⚓</a>“I have heard the complaints of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:6">⚓</a>‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:7; 1 Kin. 20:28; Joel 3:17">⚓</a>in the morning you shall be filled with bread. And you shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord your God.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_16_13"> <sup>13</sup>So it was that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:31; Ps. 78:27–29; 105:40">⚓</a>quails came up at evening and covered the camp, and in the morning <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:9">⚓</a>the dew lay all around the camp. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_14"><sup>14</sup>And when the layer of dew lifted, there, on the surface of the wilderness, was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:31; Num. 11:7, 8; Deut. 8:3; Neh. 9:15; Ps. 78:24; 105:40">⚓</a>a small round <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 147:16">⚓</a>substance, <i>as</i> fine as frost on the ground. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_15"><sup>15</sup>So when the children of Israel saw <i>it,</i> they said to one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it <i>was.</i><br/> And Moses said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:4; Neh. 9:15; Ps. 78:24; (John 6:31, 49, 58); 1 Cor. 10:3">⚓</a>“This <i>is</i> the bread which the Lord has given you to eat. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_16"><sup>16</sup>This is the thing which the Lord has commanded: ‘Let every man gather it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:4">⚓</a>according to each one’s need, one <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:32, 36">⚓</a>omer for each person, <i>according</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i> number of persons; let every man take for <i>those</i> who <i>are</i> in his tent.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_16_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then the children of Israel did so and gathered, some more, some less. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_18"><sup>18</sup>So when they measured <i>it</i> by omers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 8:15">⚓</a>he who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack. Every man had gathered according to each one’s need. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_19"><sup>19</sup>And Moses said, “Let no one <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:10; 16:23; 23:18">⚓</a>leave any of it till morning.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_20"><sup>20</sup>Notwithstanding they did not heed Moses. But some of them left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was angry with them. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_21"><sup>21</sup>So they gathered it every morning, every man according to his need. And when the sun became hot, it melted.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_16_22"> <sup>22</sup>And so it was, on the sixth day, <i>that</i> they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one. And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_23"><sup>23</sup>Then he said to them, “This <i>is</i> <i>what</i> the Lord has said: ‘Tomorrow <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:3; Ex. 20:8–11; 23:12; 31:15; 35:2; Lev. 23:3; Neh. 9:13, 14">⚓</a>a Sabbath rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. Bake what you will bake <i>today,</i> and boil what you will boil; and lay up for yourselves all that remains, to be kept until morning.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_24"><sup>24</sup>So they laid it up till morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:20">⚓</a>stink, nor were there any worms in it. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_25"><sup>25</sup>Then Moses said, “Eat that today, for today <i>is</i> a Sabbath to the Lord; today you will not find it in the field. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_26"><sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:9, 10">⚓</a>Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_16_27"> <sup>27</sup>Now it happened <i>that</i> <i>some</i> of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, but they found none. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_28"><sup>28</sup>And the Lord said to Moses, “How long <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:14; Ps. 78:10; 106:13">⚓</a>do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws? </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_29"><sup>29</sup>See! For the Lord has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days. Let every man remain in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_30"><sup>30</sup>So the people rested on the seventh day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_16_31"> <sup>31</sup>And the house of Israel called its name Manna. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:7–9; Deut. 8:3, 16">⚓</a>it <i>was</i> like white coriander seed, and the taste of it <i>was</i> like wafers <i>made</i> with honey.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_16_32"> <sup>32</sup>Then Moses said, “This <i>is</i> the thing which the Lord has commanded: ‘Fill an omer with it, to be kept for your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_33"><sup>33</sup>And Moses said to Aaron, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 9:4; Rev. 2:17">⚓</a>“Take a pot and put an omer of manna in it, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_34"><sup>34</sup>As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:16, 21; 27:21; 40:20; Num. 17:10">⚓</a>before the Testimony, to be kept. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_35"><sup>35</sup>And the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:3, 16">⚓</a>ate manna <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:38; John 6:31, 49">⚓</a>forty years, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:12; Neh. 9:20, 21">⚓</a>until they came to an inhabited land; they ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan. </span>
<span class="verse xu_16_36"><sup>36</sup>Now an omer <i>is</i> one-tenth of an ephah.<br/></span>
