<span class="verse xu_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:1">⚓</a>all the congregation of the children of Israel set out on their journey from the Wilderness of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:11–15">⚓</a>Sin, according to the commandment of the Lord, and camped in Rephidim; but <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no water for the people to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:22; Num. 20:2">⚓</a>drink. </span>
<span class="verse xu_17_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:11; Num. 20:2, 3, 13">⚓</a>Therefore the people contended with Moses, and said, “Give us water, that we may drink.”<br/> So Moses said to them, “Why do you contend with me? Why do you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 6:16); Ps. 78:18, 41; (Matt. 4:7); 1 Cor. 10:9">⚓</a>tempt the Lord?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_17_3"> <sup>3</sup>And the people thirsted there for water, and the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:2, 3">⚓</a>complained against Moses, and said, “Why <i>is</i> it you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:38">⚓</a>livestock with thirst?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_17_4"> <sup>4</sup>So Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:15">⚓</a>cried out to the Lord, saying, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:59; 10:31">⚓</a>stone me!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_17_5"> <sup>5</sup>And the Lord said to Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 2:6">⚓</a>“Go on before the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel. Also take in your hand your rod with which <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:8">⚓</a>you struck the river, and go. </span>
<span class="verse xu_17_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:10, 11; Deut. 8:15; Neh. 9:15; Ps. 78:15; 105:41; 114:8; (1 Cor. 10:4)">⚓</a>Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.”<br/> And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse xu_17_7"><sup>7</sup>So he called the name of the place <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:13, 24; 27:14; Ps. 81:7">⚓</a>Massah and Meribah, because of the contention of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, saying, “Is the Lord among us or not?”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Victory over the Amalekites</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_17_8"> <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 36:12; Num. 24:20; Deut. 25:17–19; 1 Sam. 15:2">⚓</a>Now Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim. </span>
<span class="verse xu_17_9"><sup>9</sup>And Moses said to Joshua, “Choose us some men and go out, fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:20">⚓</a>the rod of God in my hand.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_17_10"><sup>10</sup>So Joshua did as Moses said to him, and fought with Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. </span>
<span class="verse xu_17_11"><sup>11</sup>And so it was, when Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(James 5:16)">⚓</a>held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. </span>
<span class="verse xu_17_12"><sup>12</sup>But Moses’ hands <i>became</i> heavy; so they took a stone and put <i>it</i> under him, and he sat on it. And Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. </span>
<span class="verse xu_17_13"><sup>13</sup>So Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_17_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:4; 34:27; Num. 33:2">⚓</a>“Write this <i>for</i> a memorial in the book and recount <i>it</i> in the hearing of Joshua, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 25:19; 1 Sam. 15:3; 2 Sam. 1:1; 1 Chr. 4:43">⚓</a>I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_17_15"><sup>15</sup>And Moses built an altar and called its name, The-Lord-Is-My-Banner; </span>
<span class="verse xu_17_16"><sup>16</sup>for he said, “Because the Lord has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:14–16">⚓</a>sworn: the Lord<i>will</i> <i>have</i> war with Amalek from generation to generation.”<br/></span>
