<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>Jethro’s Advice</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:16, 18; 3:1">⚓</a>Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 106:2, 8)">⚓</a>God had done for Moses and for Israel His people—that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_2"><sup>2</sup>Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:21; 4:20–26">⚓</a>Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back, </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_3"><sup>3</sup>with her <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:20; 4:20; Acts 7:29">⚓</a>two sons, of whom the name of one <i>was</i> Gershom (for he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:22">⚓</a>“I have been a stranger in a foreign land”) </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_4"><sup>4</sup>and the name of the other <i>was</i> Eliezer (for <i>he</i> <i>said,</i> “The God of my father <i>was</i> my <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:25">⚓</a>help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh”); </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_5"><sup>5</sup>and Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness, where he was encamped at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:1, 12; 4:27; 24:13">⚓</a>the mountain of God. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_6"><sup>6</sup>Now he had said to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_18_7"> <sup>7</sup>So Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:2">⚓</a>went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:13; Ex. 4:27">⚓</a>kissed him. And they asked each other about <i>their</i> well-being, and they went into the tent. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_8"><sup>8</sup>And Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardship that had come upon them on the way, and <i>how</i> the Lord had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:6, 16; Ps. 81:7">⚓</a>delivered them. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_9"><sup>9</sup>Then Jethro rejoiced for all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 63:7–14)">⚓</a>good which the Lord had done for Israel, whom He had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_10"><sup>10</sup>And Jethro said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:20; 2 Sam. 18:28; 1 Kin. 8:56; Ps. 68:19, 20">⚓</a>“Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh, <i>and</i> who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_11"><sup>11</sup>Now I know that the Lord<i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:12; 15:11; 2 Chr. 2:5; Ps. 95:3; 97:9; 135:5">⚓</a>greater than all the gods; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:10, 16, 22; 5:2, 7">⚓</a>for in the very thing in which they behaved <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:51">⚓</a>proudly, <i>He</i> <i>was</i> above them.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_12"><sup>12</sup>Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:5">⚓</a>offering and <i>other</i> sacrifices <i>to</i> <i>offer</i> to God. And Aaron came with all the elders of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:54; Deut. 12:7">⚓</a>to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_18_13"> <sup>13</sup>And so it was, on the next day, that Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:4, 5; Matt. 23:2">⚓</a>sat to judge the people; and the people stood before Moses from morning until evening. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_14"><sup>14</sup>So when Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did for the people, he said, “What <i>is</i> this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit, and all the people stand before you from morning until evening?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_18_15"> <sup>15</sup>And Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 24:12; Num. 9:6, 8; 27:5; Deut. 17:8–13">⚓</a>the people come to me to inquire of God. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_16"><sup>16</sup>When they have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:14; Deut. 19:17">⚓</a>a difficulty, they come to me, and I judge between one and another; and I make known the statutes of God and His laws.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_18_17"> <sup>17</sup>So Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you do <i>is</i> not good. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_18"><sup>18</sup>Both you and these people who <i>are</i> with you will surely wear yourselves out. For this thing <i>is</i> too much for you; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:14, 17; Deut. 1:12">⚓</a>you are not able to perform it by yourself. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_19"><sup>19</sup>Listen now to my voice; I will give you counsel, and God will be with you: Stand <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:16; 20:19">⚓</a>before God for the people, so that you may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 9:8; 27:5">⚓</a>bring the difficulties to God. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_20"><sup>20</sup>And you shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 5:1">⚓</a>teach them the statutes and the laws, and show them the way in which they must walk and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:18">⚓</a>the work they must do. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_21"><sup>21</sup>Moreover you shall select from all the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:24, 25; Deut. 1:13, 15; 2 Chr. 19:5–10; Ps. 15:1–5; Acts 6:3">⚓</a>able men, such as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:18; 2 Sam. 23:3">⚓</a>fear God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 18:8">⚓</a>men of truth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 16:19">⚓</a>hating covetousness; and place <i>such</i> over them <i>to</i> <i>be</i> rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_22"><sup>22</sup>And let them judge the people at all times. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 24:11; Deut. 1:17">⚓</a>Then it will be <i>that</i> every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they themselves shall judge. So it will be easier for you, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:17">⚓</a>they will bear <i>the</i> <i>burden</i> with you. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_23"><sup>23</sup>If you do this thing, and God <i>so</i> commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all this people will also go to their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:29">⚓</a>place in peace.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_18_24"> <sup>24</sup>So Moses heeded the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_25"><sup>25</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:21; Deut. 1:15">⚓</a>Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people: rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. </span>
<span class="verse xu_18_26"><sup>26</sup>So they judged the people at all times; the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 29:16">⚓</a>hard cases they brought to Moses, but they judged every small case themselves.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_18_27"> <sup>27</sup>Then Moses let his father-in-law depart, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 10:29, 30">⚓</a>he went his way to his own land.<br/></span>
