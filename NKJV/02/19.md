<div class="title"><h1>19</h1><h3>Israel at Mount Sinai</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:15">⚓</a>they came <i>to</i> the Wilderness of Sinai. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_2"><sup>2</sup>For they had departed from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:1">⚓</a>Rephidim, had come <i>to</i> the Wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness. So Israel camped there before <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:1, 12; 18:5">⚓</a>the mountain.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_19_3"> <sup>3</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:38">⚓</a>Moses went up to God, and the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:4">⚓</a>called to him from the mountain, saying, “Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:2">⚓</a>‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and <i>how</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:11; Is. 63:9; Rev. 12:14">⚓</a>I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Myself. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_5"><sup>5</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:26; 23:22">⚓</a>therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 5:2; Ps. 78:10">⚓</a>keep My covenant, then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:20; 7:6; 14:2; 26:18; 1 Kin. 8:53; Ps. 135:4; Titus 2:14; 1 Pet. 2:9">⚓</a>you shall be a special treasure to Me above all people; for all the earth <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:29; Deut. 10:14; Job 41:11; Ps. 50:12; 1 Cor. 10:26">⚓</a>Mine. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_6"><sup>6</sup>And you shall be to Me a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:2–4; (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6; 5:10)">⚓</a>kingdom of priests and a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:6; 14:21; 26:19; Is. 62:12; (1 Cor. 3:17)">⚓</a>holy nation.’ These <i>are</i> the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_19_7"> <sup>7</sup>So Moses came and called for the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:29, 30">⚓</a>elders of the people, and laid before them all these words which the Lord commanded him. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_8"><sup>8</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:31; 24:3, 7; Deut. 5:27; 26:17">⚓</a>all the people answered together and said, “All that the Lord has spoken we will do.” So Moses brought back the words of the people to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_9"><sup>9</sup>And the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I come to you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:16; 20:21; 24:15; Deut. 4:11; Ps. 99:7; Matt. 17:5">⚓</a>in the thick cloud, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:12, 36; John 12:29, 30">⚓</a>that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you forever.”<br/> So Moses told the words of the people to the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_19_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to the people and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:44, 45; (Heb. 10:22)">⚓</a>consecrate them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_11"><sup>11</sup>And let them be ready for the third day. For on the third day the Lord will come down upon Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_12"><sup>12</sup>You shall set bounds for the people all around, saying, ‘Take heed to yourselves <i>that</i> you do <i>not</i> go up to the mountain or touch its base. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:3; Heb. 12:20">⚓</a>Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_13"><sup>13</sup>Not a hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot <i>with</i> <i>an</i> <i>arrow;</i> whether man or beast, he shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come near the mountain.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_19_14"> <sup>14</sup>So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_15"><sup>15</sup>And he said to the people, “Be ready for the third day; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 7:5)">⚓</a>do not come near <i>your</i> wives.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_19_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then it came to pass on the third day, in the morning, that there were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 12:18, 19">⚓</a>thunderings and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain; and the sound of the trumpet was very loud, so that all the people who <i>were</i> in the camp <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 12:21">⚓</a>trembled. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_17"><sup>17</sup>And Moses brought th<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:10">⚓</a>e people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_18"><sup>18</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:11; Judg. 5:5; Ps. 104:32; 144:5">⚓</a>Mount Sinai <i>was</i> completely in smoke, because the Lord descended upon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:2; 24:17; Deut. 5:4; 2 Chr. 7:1–3; Heb. 12:18">⚓</a>it in fire. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:17; 19:28; Rev. 15:8">⚓</a>Its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 68:8; 1 Kin. 19:12; Jer. 4:24; (Heb. 12:26)">⚓</a>whole mountain quaked greatly. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_19"><sup>19</sup>And when the blast of the trumpet sounded long and became louder and louder, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 12:21">⚓</a>Moses spoke, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:13; Ps. 81:7">⚓</a>God answered him by voice. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_20"><sup>20</sup>Then the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain. And the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_19_21"> <sup>21</sup>And the Lord said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people, lest they break through <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 6:19">⚓</a>to gaze at the Lord, and many of them perish. </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_22"><sup>22</sup>Also let the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:24; 24:5">⚓</a>priests who come near the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 10:3; 21:6–8">⚓</a>consecrate themselves, lest the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:7, 8">⚓</a>break out against them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_19_23"> <sup>23</sup>But Moses said to the Lord, “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai; for You warned us, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:12">⚓</a>‘Set bounds around the mountain and consecrate it.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_19_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then the Lord said to him, “Away! Get down and then come up, you and Aaron with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the Lord, lest He break out against them.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_19_25"><sup>25</sup>So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.<br/></span>
