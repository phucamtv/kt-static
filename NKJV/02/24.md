<span class="verse xu_24_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now He said to Moses, “Come up to the Lord, you and Aaron, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:23; 28:1; Lev. 10:1, 2">⚓</a>Nadab and Abihu, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:5; Num. 11:16">⚓</a>and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship from afar. </span>
<span class="verse xu_24_2"><sup>2</sup>And Moses alone shall come near the Lord, but they shall not come near; nor shall the people go up with him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_24_3"> <sup>3</sup>So Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord and all the judgments. And all the people answered with one voice and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:8; 24:7; Deut. 5:27; (Gal. 3:19)">⚓</a>“All the words which the Lord has said we will do.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_24_4"><sup>4</sup>And Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:14; 34:27; Deut. 31:9">⚓</a>wrote all the words of the Lord. And he rose early in the morning, and built an altar at the foot of the mountain, and twelve <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:18">⚓</a>pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse xu_24_5"><sup>5</sup>Then he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:12; 20:24">⚓</a>burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse xu_24_6"><sup>6</sup>And Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:16, 20; Heb. 9:18">⚓</a>took half the blood and put <i>it</i> in basins, and half the blood he sprinkled on the altar. </span>
<span class="verse xu_24_7"><sup>7</sup>Then he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:4; Heb. 9:19">⚓</a>took the Book of the Covenant and read in the hearing of the people. And they said, “All that the Lord has said we will do, and be obedient.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_24_8"><sup>8</sup>And Moses took the blood, sprinkled <i>it</i> on the people, and said, “This is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 9:11; (Matt. 26:28; Mark 14:24; Luke 22:20; 1 Cor. 11:25; Heb. 9:19, 20; 13:20; 1 Pet. 1:2)">⚓</a>the blood of the covenant which the Lord has made with you according to all these words.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>On the Mountain with God</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_24_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then Moses went up, also Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, </span>
<span class="verse xu_24_10"><sup>10</sup>and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:11; Num. 12:8; Is. 6:5; (John 1:18; 6:46); 1 John 4:12">⚓</a>saw the God of Israel. And <i>there</i> <i>was</i> under His feet as it were a paved work of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:26; Rev. 4:3">⚓</a>sapphire stone, and it was like the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:2">⚓</a>very heavens in <i>its</i> clarity. </span>
<span class="verse xu_24_11"><sup>11</sup>But on the nobles of the children of Israel He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:21">⚓</a>did not lay His hand. So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:30; Judg. 13:22">⚓</a>they saw God, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 10:18">⚓</a>ate and drank.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_24_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:2, 15">⚓</a>“Come up to Me on the mountain and be there; and I will give you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 31:18; 32:15; Deut. 5:22">⚓</a>tablets of stone, and the law and commandments which I have written, that you may teach them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_24_13"> <sup>13</sup>So Moses arose with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:17">⚓</a>his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up to the mountain of God. </span>
<span class="verse xu_24_14"><sup>14</sup>And he said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we come back to you. Indeed, Aaron and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:10, 12">⚓</a>Hur <i>are</i> with you. If any man has a difficulty, let him go to them.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_24_15"><sup>15</sup>Then Moses went up into the mountain, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:9; Matt. 17:5">⚓</a>a cloud covered the mountain.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_24_16"> <sup>16</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:10; 33:18; Num. 14:10">⚓</a>the glory of the Lord rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day He called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. </span>
<span class="verse xu_24_17"><sup>17</sup>The sight of the glory of the Lord<i>was</i> like <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:2; Deut. 4:26, 36; 9:3; Heb. 12:18, 29">⚓</a>a consuming fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse xu_24_18"><sup>18</sup>So Moses went into the midst of the cloud and went up into the mountain. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:28; Deut. 9:9; 10:10">⚓</a>Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.<br/></span>
