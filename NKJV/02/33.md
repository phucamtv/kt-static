<div class="title"><h1>33</h1><h3>The Command to Leave Sinai</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_33_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Depart <i>and</i> go up from here, you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:1, 7, 13; Josh. 3:17">⚓</a>and the people whom you have brought out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:7">⚓</a>‘To your descendants I will give it.’ </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:34; Josh. 5:14">⚓</a>And I will send <i>My</i> Angel before you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:27–31; Josh. 24:11">⚓</a>and I will drive out the Canaanite and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite. </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_3"><sup>3</sup><i>Go</i> <i>up</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:8">⚓</a>to a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, lest <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:21, 45">⚓</a>I consume you on the way, for you <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:9; 33:5">⚓</a>a stiff-necked people.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_33_4"> <sup>4</sup>And when the people heard this bad news, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:1, 39">⚓</a>they mourned, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 9:3; Esth. 4:1, 4; Ezek. 24:17, 23">⚓</a>and no one put on his ornaments. </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_5"><sup>5</sup>For the Lord had said to Moses, “Say to the children of Israel, ‘You <i>are</i> a stiff-necked people. I could come up into your midst in one moment and consume you. Now therefore, take off your ornaments, that I may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 139:23)">⚓</a>know what to do to you.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_6"><sup>6</sup>So the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by Mount Horeb.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Moses Meets with the Lord</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_33_7"> <sup>7</sup>Moses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:42, 43">⚓</a>called it the tabernacle of meeting. And it came to pass <i>that</i> everyone who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:29">⚓</a>sought the Lord went out to the tabernacle of meeting which <i>was</i> outside the camp. </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_8"><sup>8</sup>So it was, whenever Moses went out to the tabernacle, <i>that</i> all the people rose, and each man stood <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:27">⚓</a><i>at</i> his tent door and watched Moses until he had gone into the tabernacle. </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_9"><sup>9</sup>And it came to pass, when Moses entered the tabernacle, that the pillar of cloud descended and stood <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle, and <i>the</i> <i>Lord</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:22; 31:18; Ps. 99:7">⚓</a>talked with Moses. </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_10"><sup>10</sup>All the people saw the pillar of cloud standing <i>at</i> the tabernacle door, and all the people rose and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:31">⚓</a>worshiped, each man <i>in</i> his tent door. </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_11"><sup>11</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:8; Deut. 34:10">⚓</a>the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he would return to the camp, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:13">⚓</a>his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the tabernacle.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Promise of God’s Presence</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_33_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then Moses said to the Lord, “See, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:10; 32:34">⚓</a>You say to me, ‘Bring up this people.’ But You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:17; John 10:14, 15; 2 Tim. 2:19">⚓</a>‘I know you by name, and you have also found grace in My sight.’ </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_13"><sup>13</sup>Now therefore, I pray, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:9">⚓</a>if I have found grace in Your sight, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 25:4; 27:11; 86:11; 119:33">⚓</a>show me now Your way, that I may know You and that I may find grace in Your sight. And consider that this nation <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:7, 10; 5:1; 32:12, 14; Deut. 9:26, 29">⚓</a>Your people.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_33_14"> <sup>14</sup>And He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:12; Deut. 4:37; Is. 63:9">⚓</a>“My Presence will go <i>with</i> <i>you,</i> and I will give you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:10; 25:19; Josh. 21:44; 22:4">⚓</a>rest.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_33_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then he said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:3">⚓</a>“If Your Presence does not go <i>with</i> <i>us,</i> do not bring us up from here. </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_16"><sup>16</sup>For how then will it be known that Your people and I have found grace in Your sight, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:14">⚓</a>except You go with us? So we <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:10; Deut. 4:7, 34">⚓</a>shall be separate, Your people and I, from all the people who <i>are</i> upon the face of the earth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_33_17"> <sup>17</sup>So the Lord said to Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(James 5:16)">⚓</a>“I will also do this thing that you have spoken; for you have found grace in My sight, and I know you by name.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_33_18"> <sup>18</sup>And he said, “Please, show me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:16, 17; (1 Tim. 6:16)">⚓</a>Your glory.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_33_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then He said, “I will make all My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:6, 7">⚓</a>goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 9:15, 16, 18)">⚓</a>I will be gracious to whom I will be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 4:4, 16)">⚓</a>gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_20"><sup>20</sup>But He said, “You cannot see My face; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 32:30)">⚓</a>no man shall see Me, and live.” </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_21"><sup>21</sup>And the Lord said, “Here is a place by Me, and you shall stand on the rock. </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_22"><sup>22</sup>So it shall be, while My glory passes by, that I will put you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Song 2:14; Is. 2:21">⚓</a>in the cleft of the rock, and will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 91:1, 4; Is. 49:2; 51:16">⚓</a>cover you with My hand while I pass by. </span>
<span class="verse xu_33_23"><sup>23</sup>Then I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:20; (John 1:18)">⚓</a>not be seen.”<br/></span>
