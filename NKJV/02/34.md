<div class="title"><h1>34</h1><h3>Moses Makes New Tablets</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_34_1"> <sup>1</sup>And the Lord said to Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 24:12; 31:18; 32:15, 16, 19; Deut. 4:13)">⚓</a>“Cut two tablets of stone like the first <i>ones,</i> and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 10:2, 4">⚓</a>I will write on <i>these</i> tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke. </span>
<span class="verse xu_34_2"><sup>2</sup>So be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself to Me there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:11, 18, 20">⚓</a>on the top of the mountain. </span>
<span class="verse xu_34_3"><sup>3</sup>And no man shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:12, 13; 24:9–11">⚓</a>come up with you, and let no man be seen throughout all the mountain; let neither flocks nor herds feed before that mountain.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_34_4"> <sup>4</sup>So he cut two tablets of stone like the first <i>ones.</i> Then Moses rose early in the morning and went up Mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him; and he took in his hand the two tablets of stone.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_34_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now the Lord descended in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:9">⚓</a>cloud and stood with him there, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:19">⚓</a>proclaimed the name of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse xu_34_6"><sup>6</sup>And the Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:18; Deut. 4:31; Neh. 9:17; Joel 2:13">⚓</a>God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 2:4">⚓</a>goodness and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 108:4">⚓</a>truth, </span>
<span class="verse xu_34_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:6">⚓</a>keeping mercy for thousands, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 103:3, 4; Dan. 9:9; Eph. 4:32; 1 John 1:9">⚓</a>forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:19; Job 10:14; Mic. 6:11; Nah. 1:3">⚓</a>by no means clearing <i>the</i> <i>guilty,</i> visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children’s children to the third and the fourth generation.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xu_34_8"> <sup>8</sup>So Moses made haste and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:31">⚓</a>bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped. </span>
<span class="verse xu_34_9"><sup>9</sup>Then he said, “If now I have found grace in Your sight, O Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:12–16">⚓</a>let my Lord, I pray, go among us, even though we <i>are</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:3">⚓</a>stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 33:12; 94:14">⚓</a>Your inheritance.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Covenant Renewed</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_34_10"> <sup>10</sup>And He said: “Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:27, 28; Deut. 5:2">⚓</a>I make a covenant. Before all your people I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:32; Ps. 77:14">⚓</a>do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among whom you <i>are</i> shall see the work of the Lord. For it <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 145:6">⚓</a>an awesome thing that I will do with you. </span>
<span class="verse xu_34_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:25">⚓</a>Observe what I command you this day.

<span class="verse xu_34_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:32, 33">⚓</a>Take heed to yourself, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be a snare in your midst. </span>

<span class="verse xu_34_27"> <sup>27</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Write <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:14; 24:4; Deut. 31:9">⚓</a>these words, for according to the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.” </span>

<div class="title"><h3>The Shining Face of Moses</h3></div>
<span class="verse xu_34_29"> <sup>29</sup>Now it was so, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai (and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:15">⚓</a>two tablets of the Testimony <i>were</i> in Moses’ hand when he came down from the mountain), that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone while he talked with Him. </span>
<span class="verse xu_34_30"><sup>30</sup>So when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:2; 2 Cor. 3:7">⚓</a>the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him. </span>
<span class="verse xu_34_31"><sup>31</sup>Then Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses talked with them. </span>
<span class="verse xu_34_32"><sup>32</sup>Afterward all the children of Israel came near, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:3">⚓</a>and he gave them as commandments all that the Lord had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. </span>
<span class="verse xu_34_33"><sup>33</sup>And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 3:13, 14)">⚓</a>a veil on his face. </span>
<span class="verse xu_34_34"><sup>34</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 3:13–16)">⚓</a>whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with Him, he would take the veil off until he came out; and he would come out and speak to the children of Israel whatever he had been commanded. </span>
<span class="verse xu_34_35"><sup>35</sup>And whenever the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone, then Moses would put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with Him.<br/></span>
