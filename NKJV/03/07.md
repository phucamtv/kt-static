<span class="verse le_7_3"><sup>3</sup>And he shall offer from it all its fat. The fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails, </span>
<span class="verse le_7_4"><sup>4</sup>the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys, he shall remove; </span>
<span class="verse le_7_5"><sup>5</sup>and the priest shall burn them on the altar as an offering made by fire to the Lord. It is a trespass offering. </span>
