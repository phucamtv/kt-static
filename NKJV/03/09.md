<span class="verse le_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>It came to pass on the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 43:27">⚓</a>eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse le_9_2"><sup>2</sup>And he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a young <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:21; Lev. 4:1–12">⚓</a>bull as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse le_9_3"><sup>3</sup>And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 4:23, 28; Ezra 6:17; 10:19">⚓</a>‘Take a kid of the goats as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, as a burnt offering, </span>
<span class="verse le_9_4"><sup>4</sup>also a bull and a ram as peace offerings, to sacrifice before the Lord, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 2:4">⚓</a>a grain offering mixed with oil; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:43; Lev. 9:6, 23">⚓</a>today the Lord will appear to you.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_9_5"> <sup>5</sup>So they brought what Moses commanded before the tabernacle of meeting. And all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse le_9_6"><sup>6</sup>Then Moses said, “This is the thing which the Lord commanded you to do, and the glory of the Lord will appear to you.” </span>
<span class="verse le_9_7"><sup>7</sup>And Moses said to Aaron, “Go to the altar, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 4:3; 1 Sam. 3:14; (Heb. 5:3–5; 7:27)">⚓</a>offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself and for the people. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 4:16, 20; Heb. 5:1">⚓</a>Offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as the Lord commanded.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_9_8"> <sup>8</sup>Aaron therefore went to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. </span>
<span class="verse le_9_9"><sup>9</sup>Then the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him. And he dipped his finger in the blood, put it on the horns of the altar, and poured the blood at the base of the altar. </span>
<span class="verse le_9_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:18; Lev. 8:16">⚓</a>But the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe from the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses. </span>
<span class="verse le_9_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 4:11, 12; 8:17">⚓</a>The flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp.<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_9_12"> <sup>12</sup>And he killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented to him the blood, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 1:5; 8:19">⚓</a>which he sprinkled all around on the altar. </span>
<span class="verse le_9_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 8:20">⚓</a>Then they presented the burnt offering to him, with its pieces and head, and he burned them on the altar. </span>
<span class="verse le_9_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 8:21">⚓</a>And he washed the entrails and the legs, and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_9_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 53:10; Heb. 2:17; 5:3)">⚓</a>Then he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and killed it and offered it for sin, like the first one. </span>
<span class="verse le_9_16"><sup>16</sup>And he brought the burnt offering and offered it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 1:1–13">⚓</a>according to the prescribed manner. </span>
<span class="verse le_9_17"><sup>17</sup>Then he brought the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:38, 39">⚓</a>besides the burnt sacrifice of the morning.<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_9_18"> <sup>18</sup>He also killed the bull and the ram as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 3:1–11">⚓</a>sacrifices of peace offerings, which were for the people. And Aaron’s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar, </span>
<span class="verse le_9_19"><sup>19</sup>and the fat from the bull and the ram—the fatty tail, what covers the entrails and the kidneys, and the fatty lobe attached to the liver; </span>
<span class="verse le_9_20"><sup>20</sup>and they put the fat on the breasts. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 3:5, 16">⚓</a>Then he burned the fat on the altar; </span>
<span class="verse le_9_21"><sup>21</sup>but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:24, 26, 27; Lev. 7:30–34">⚓</a>as a wave offering before the Lord, as Moses had commanded.<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_9_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then Aaron lifted his hand toward the people, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 6:22–26; Deut. 21:5; Luke 24:50">⚓</a>blessed them, and came down from offering the sin offering, the burnt offering, and peace offerings. </span>
<span class="verse le_9_23"><sup>23</sup>And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of meeting, and came out and blessed the people. Then the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people, </span>
<span class="verse le_9_24"><sup>24</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:4; Judg. 6:21; 2 Chr. 7:1; Ps. 20:3">⚓</a>fire came out from before the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. When all the people saw it, they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 3:11">⚓</a>shouted and fell on their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:38, 39">⚓</a>faces.<br/></span>
