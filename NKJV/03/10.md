<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>The Profane Fire of Nadab and Abihu</h3></div>
<span class="verse le_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:1, 9; Num. 3:2–4; 1 Chr. 24:2">⚓</a>Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 16:12">⚓</a>each took his censer and put fire in it, put incense on it, and offered <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:9; 1 Sam. 2:17">⚓</a>profane fire before the Lord, which He had not commanded them. </span>
<span class="verse le_10_2"><sup>2</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:24; Num. 11:1; 16:35; Rev. 20:9">⚓</a>fire went out from the Lord and devoured them, and they died before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse le_10_3"><sup>3</sup>And Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the Lord spoke, saying:<br/>  ‘By those <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:22; Lev. 21:6; Is. 52:11; Ezek. 20:41">⚓</a>who come near Me<br/>   I must be regarded as holy;<br/>   And before all the people<br/>   I must be glorified.’ ”<br/> So Aaron held his peace.<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_10_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Come near, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:6, 10">⚓</a>carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.” </span>
<span class="verse le_10_5"><sup>5</sup>So they went near and carried them by their tunics out of the camp, as Moses had said.<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_10_6"> <sup>6</sup>And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons, “Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, lest you die, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 1:53; 16:22, 46; 18:5; Josh. 7:1; 22:18, 20; 2 Sam. 24:1">⚓</a>wrath come upon all the people. But let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Lord has kindled. </span>
<span class="verse le_10_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 8:33; 21:12">⚓</a>You shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 8:30">⚓</a>for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you.” And they did according to the word of Moses.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Conduct Prescribed for Priests</h3></div>
<span class="verse le_10_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Aaron, saying: </span>
<span class="verse le_10_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:21; (Prov. 20:1; 31:5); Is. 28:7; Ezek. 44:21; Hos. 4:11; Luke 1:15; (Eph. 5:18); 1 Tim. 3:3; Titus 1:7">⚓</a>“Do not drink wine or intoxicating drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the tabernacle of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations, </span>
<span class="verse le_10_10"><sup>10</sup>that you may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:47; 20:25; Ezek. 22:26; 44:23">⚓</a>distinguish between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean, </span>
<span class="verse le_10_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 24:8; Neh. 8:2, 8; Jer. 18:18; Mal. 2:7">⚓</a>and that you may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_10_12"> <sup>12</sup>And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons who were left: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 18:9">⚓</a>“Take the grain offering that remains of the offerings made by fire to the Lord, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 21:22">⚓</a>for it is most holy. </span>
<span class="verse le_10_13"><sup>13</sup>You shall eat it in a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 18:10">⚓</a>holy place, because it is your due and your sons’ due, of the sacrifices made by fire to the Lord; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 2:3; 6:16">⚓</a>so I have been commanded. </span>
<span class="verse le_10_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:24, 26, 27; Lev. 7:30–34; Num. 18:11">⚓</a>The breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering you shall eat in a clean place, you, your sons, and your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 22:13">⚓</a>daughters with you; for they are your due and your sons’ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 18:10">⚓</a>due, which are given from the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse le_10_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 7:29, 30, 34">⚓</a>The thigh of the heave offering and the breast of the wave offering they shall bring with the offerings of fat made by fire, to offer as a wave offering before the Lord. And it shall be yours and your sons’ with you, by a statute forever, as the Lord has commanded.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_10_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then Moses made careful inquiry about <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 9:3, 15">⚓</a>the goat of the sin offering, and there it was—burned up. And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying, </span>
<span class="verse le_10_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 6:24–30">⚓</a>“Why have you not eaten the sin offering in a holy place, since it is most holy, and God has given it to you to bear <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 28:38; Lev. 22:16; Num. 18:1">⚓</a>the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord? </span>
<span class="verse le_10_18"><sup>18</sup>See! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 6:30">⚓</a>Its blood was not brought inside the holy place; indeed you should have eaten it in a holy place, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 6:26, 30">⚓</a>as I commanded.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_10_19"> <sup>19</sup>And Aaron said to Moses, “Look, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 9:8, 12">⚓</a>this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord, and such things have befallen me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 1:11–15); Jer. 6:20; 14:12; Hos. 9:4; (Mal. 1:10, 13; 3:1–4)">⚓</a>would it have been accepted in the sight of the Lord?” </span>
<span class="verse le_10_20"><sup>20</sup>So when Moses heard that, he was content.<br/></span>
