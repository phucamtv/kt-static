<span class="verse le_21_2"><sup>2</sup>except for his relatives who are nearest to him: his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, and his brother; </span>
<span class="verse le_21_3"><sup>3</sup>also his virgin sister who is near to him, who has had no husband, for her he may defile himself. </span>
<span class="verse le_21_4"><sup>4</sup>Otherwise he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_21_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:27; Deut. 14:1; Ezek. 44:20">⚓</a>‘They shall not make any bald place on their heads, nor shall they shave the edges of their beards nor make any cuttings in their flesh. </span>
<span class="verse le_21_6"><sup>6</sup>They shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:31">⚓</a>holy to their God and not profane the name of their God, for they offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 3:11">⚓</a>bread of their God; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 52:11">⚓</a>therefore they shall be holy. </span>
<span class="verse le_21_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 44:22">⚓</a>They shall not take a wife who is a harlot or a defiled woman, nor shall they take a woman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 24:1, 2">⚓</a>divorced from her husband; for the priest is holy to his God. </span>
<span class="verse le_21_8"><sup>8</sup>Therefore you shall consecrate him, for he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to you, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:44, 45">⚓</a>I the Lord, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 8:12, 30">⚓</a>sanctify you, am holy. </span>
<span class="verse le_21_9"><sup>9</sup>The daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by playing the harlot, she profanes her father. She shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 22:21">⚓</a>burned with fire.<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_21_10"> <sup>10</sup>‘He who is the high priest among his brethren, on whose head the anointing oil was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 8:12">⚓</a>poured and who is consecrated to wear the garments, shall not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 10:6, 7">⚓</a>uncover his head nor tear his clothes; </span>
<span class="verse le_21_11"><sup>11</sup>nor shall he go <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 19:14">⚓</a>near any dead body, nor defile himself for his father or his mother; </span>
<span class="verse le_21_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 10:7">⚓</a>nor shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:6, 7">⚓</a>consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse le_21_13"><sup>13</sup>And he shall take a wife in her virginity. </span>
<span class="verse le_21_14"><sup>14</sup>A widow or a divorced woman or a defiled woman or a harlot—these he shall not marry; but he shall take a virgin of his own people as wife. </span>
<span class="verse le_21_15"><sup>15</sup>Nor shall he profane his posterity among his people, for I the Lord sanctify him.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_21_16"> <sup>16</sup>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, </span>
<span class="verse le_21_17"><sup>17</sup>“Speak to Aaron, saying: ‘No man of your descendants in succeeding generations, who has any defect, may approach to offer the bread of his God. </span>
<span class="verse le_21_18"><sup>18</sup>For any man who has a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 22:19–25">⚓</a>defect shall not approach: a man blind or lame, who has a marred face or any limb <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 22:23">⚓</a>too long, </span>
<span class="verse le_21_19"><sup>19</sup>a man who has a broken foot or broken hand, </span>
<span class="verse le_21_20"><sup>20</sup>or is a hunchback or a dwarf, or a man who has a defect in his eye, or eczema or scab, or is a eunuch. </span>
<span class="verse le_21_21"><sup>21</sup>No man of the descendants of Aaron the priest, who has a defect, shall come near to offer the offerings made by fire to the Lord. He has a defect; he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God. </span>
<span class="verse le_21_22"><sup>22</sup>He may eat the bread of his God, both the most holy and the holy; </span>
<span class="verse le_21_23"><sup>23</sup>only he shall not go near the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 16:2">⚓</a>veil or approach the altar, because he has a defect, lest <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 21:12">⚓</a>he profane My sanctuaries; for I the Lord sanctify them.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse le_21_24"> <sup>24</sup>And Moses told it to Aaron and his sons, and to all the children of Israel.<br/></span>
