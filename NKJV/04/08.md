<span class="verse dan_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_2"><sup>2</sup>“Speak to Aaron, and say to him, ‘When you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 24:2–4">⚓</a>arrange the lamps, the seven <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:37; 40:25">⚓</a>lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_3"><sup>3</sup>And Aaron did so; he arranged the lamps to face toward the front of the lampstand, as the Lord commanded Moses. </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:31">⚓</a>Now this workmanship of the lampstand <i>was</i> hammered gold; from its shaft to its flowers it <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:18">⚓</a>hammered work. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:40; Acts 7:44">⚓</a>According to the pattern which the Lord had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Cleansing and Dedication of the Levites</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_8_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_6"><sup>6</sup>“Take the Levites from among the children of Israel and cleanse them <i>ceremonially.</i></span>
<span class="verse dan_8_7"><sup>7</sup>Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 19:9, 13, 17, 20; Ps. 51:2, 7; (Heb. 9:13, 14)">⚓</a>Sprinkle water of purification on them, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 14:8, 9">⚓</a>let them shave all their body, and let them wash their clothes, and <i>so</i> make themselves clean. </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_8"><sup>8</sup>Then let them take a young bull with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 2:1; Num. 15:8–10">⚓</a>its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another young bull as a sin offering. </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:4; 40:12">⚓</a>And you shall bring the Levites before the tabernacle of meeting, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 8:3">⚓</a>and you shall gather together the whole congregation of the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_10"><sup>10</sup>So you shall bring the Levites before the Lord, and the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 1:4">⚓</a>shall lay their hands on the Levites; </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_11"><sup>11</sup>and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord<i>like</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 18:6">⚓</a>wave offering from the children of Israel, that they may perform the work of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:10">⚓</a>Then the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls, and you shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the Lord, to make atonement for the Levites.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_8_13"> <sup>13</sup>“And you shall stand the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and then offer them <i>like</i> a wave offering to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_14"><sup>14</sup>Thus you shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:9">⚓</a>separate the Levites from among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 3:12, 45; 16:9">⚓</a>Mine. </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_15"><sup>15</sup>After that the Levites shall go in to service the tabernacle of meeting. So you shall cleanse them and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 8:11, 13">⚓</a>offer them <i>like</i> a wave offering. </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_16"><sup>16</sup>For they <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 3:9">⚓</a>wholly given to Me from among the children of Israel; I have taken them for Myself <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:2; Num. 3:12, 45">⚓</a>instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:2, 12, 13, 15; Num. 3:13; Luke 2:23">⚓</a>For all the firstborn among the children of Israel <i>are</i> Mine, <i>both</i> man and beast; on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them to Myself. </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_18"><sup>18</sup>I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_19"><sup>19</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 3:9">⚓</a>I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the work for the children of Israel in the tabernacle of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 1:53; 16:46; 18:5; 2 Chr. 26:16">⚓</a>that there be no plague among the children of Israel when the children of Israel come near the sanctuary.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_8_20"> <sup>20</sup>Thus Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel did to the Levites; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children of Israel did to them. </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 8:7">⚓</a>And the Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes; then Aaron presented them <i>like</i> a wave offering before the Lord, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them. </span>

<span class="verse dan_8_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_24"><sup>24</sup>“This <i>is</i> what <i>pertains</i> to the Levites: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 4:3; 1 Chr. 23:3, 24, 27">⚓</a>From twenty-five years old and above one may enter to perform service in the work of the tabernacle of meeting; </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_25"><sup>25</sup>and at the age of fifty years they must cease performing this work, and shall work no more. </span>
<span class="verse dan_8_26"><sup>26</sup>They may minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of meeting, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 1:53">⚓</a>to attend to needs, but they <i>themselves</i> shall do no work. Thus you shall do to the Levites regarding their duties.”<br/></span>
