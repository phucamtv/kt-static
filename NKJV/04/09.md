<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>The Second Passover</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the Lord spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying: </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_2"><sup>2</sup>“Let the children of Israel keep <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:1–16; Lev. 23:5; Num. 28:16; Deut. 16:1, 2">⚓</a>the Passover at its appointed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:1–15; Luke 22:7; (1 Cor. 5:7, 8)">⚓</a>time. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_3"><sup>3</sup>On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time. According to all its rites and ceremonies you shall keep it.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_4"><sup>4</sup>So Moses told the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_5"><sup>5</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:10">⚓</a>they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, at twilight, in the Wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_9_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now there were <i>certain</i> men who were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 5:2; 19:11–22; John 18:28">⚓</a>defiled by a human corpse, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:15, 19, 26; Num. 27:2">⚓</a>and they came before Moses and Aaron that day. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_7"><sup>7</sup>And those men said to him, “We <i>became</i> defiled by a human corpse. Why are we kept from presenting the offering of the Lord at its appointed time among the children of Israel?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_9_8"> <sup>8</sup>And Moses said to them, “Stand still, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:22; Num. 27:5">⚓</a>I may hear what the Lord will command concerning you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_9_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_10"><sup>10</sup>“Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘If anyone of you or your posterity is unclean because of a corpse, or <i>is</i> far away on a journey, he may still keep the Lord’s Passover. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_11"><sup>11</sup>On <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:2, 15">⚓</a>the fourteenth day of the second month, at twilight, they may keep it. They shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:8">⚓</a>eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:10">⚓</a>They shall leave none of it until morning, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:46; (John 19:36)">⚓</a>nor break one of its bones. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:43">⚓</a>According to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_13"><sup>13</sup>But the man who <i>is</i> clean and is not on a journey, and ceases to keep the Passover, that same person <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:14; Ex. 12:15, 47">⚓</a>shall be cut off from among his people, because he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 9:7">⚓</a>did not bring the offering of the Lord at its appointed time; that man shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 5:31">⚓</a>bear his sin.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_9_14"> <sup>14</sup>‘And if a stranger dwells among you, and would keep the Lord’s Passover, he must do so according to the rite of the Passover and according to its ceremony; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:49; Lev. 24:22; Num. 15:15, 16, 29">⚓</a>you shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger and the native of the land.’ ”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Cloud and the Fire</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_9_15"> <sup>15</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 40:33, 34; Neh. 9:12, 19; Ps. 78:14">⚓</a>on the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 4:5">⚓</a>covered the tabernacle, the tent of the Testimony; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:21, 22; 40:38">⚓</a>from evening until morning it was above the tabernacle like the appearance of fire. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_16"><sup>16</sup>So it was always: the cloud covered it <i>by</i> <i>day,</i> and the appearance of fire by night. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_17"><sup>17</sup>Whenever the cloud <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 40:36–38; Num. 10:11, 12, 33, 34; Ps. 80:1">⚓</a>was taken up from above the tabernacle, after that the children of Israel would journey; and in the place where the cloud settled, there the children of Israel would pitch their tents. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_18"><sup>18</sup>At the command of the Lord the children of Israel would journey, and at the command of the Lord they would camp; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 10:1">⚓</a>as long as the cloud stayed above the tabernacle they remained encamped. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_19"><sup>19</sup>Even when the cloud continued long, many days above the tabernacle, the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 1:53; 3:8">⚓</a>kept the charge of the Lord and did not journey. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_20"><sup>20</sup>So it was, when the cloud was above the tabernacle a few days: according to the command of the Lord they would remain encamped, and according to the command of the Lord they would journey. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_21"><sup>21</sup>So it was, when the cloud remained only from evening until morning: when the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they would journey; whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud was taken up, they would journey. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_22"><sup>22</sup><i>Whether</i> <i>it</i> <i>was</i> two days, a month, or a year that the cloud remained above the tabernacle, the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 40:36, 37">⚓</a>would remain encamped and not journey; but when it was taken up, they would journey. </span>
<span class="verse dan_9_23"><sup>23</sup>At the command of the Lord they remained encamped, and at the command of the Lord they journeyed; they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 9:19">⚓</a>kept the charge of the Lord, at the command of the Lord by the hand of Moses.<br/></span>
