<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>The People Complain</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:2; 16:11; 17:5; Deut. 9:22">⚓</a><i>when</i> the people complained, it displeased the Lord; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:21">⚓</a>for the Lord heard <i>it,</i> and His anger was aroused. So the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 10:2; 2 Kin. 1:12">⚓</a>fire of the Lord burned among them, and consumed <i>some</i> in the outskirts of the camp. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_2"><sup>2</sup>Then the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:11, 13; 21:7">⚓</a>cried out to Moses, and when Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(James 5:16)">⚓</a>prayed to the Lord, the fire was quenched. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_3"><sup>3</sup>So he called the name of the place Taberah, because the fire of the Lord had burned among them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_11_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:38">⚓</a>mixed multitude who were among them yielded to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 10:6">⚓</a>intense craving; so the children of Israel also wept again and said: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 78:18)">⚓</a>“Who will give us meat to eat? </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:3">⚓</a>We remember the fish which we ate freely in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic; </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_6"><sup>6</sup>but now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:5">⚓</a>our whole being <i>is</i> dried up; <i>there</i> <i>is</i> nothing at all except this manna <i>before</i> our eyes!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_11_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:14, 31">⚓</a>the manna <i>was</i> like coriander seed, and its color like the color of bdellium. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_8"><sup>8</sup>The people went about and gathered <i>it,</i> ground <i>it</i> on millstones or beat <i>it</i> in the mortar, cooked <i>it</i> in pans, and made cakes of it; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:31">⚓</a>its taste was like the taste of pastry prepared with oil. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_9"><sup>9</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:13, 14">⚓</a>when the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_11_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, everyone at the door of his tent; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:21">⚓</a>the anger of the Lord was greatly aroused; Moses also was displeased. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 5:22; Deut. 1:12">⚓</a>So Moses said to the Lord, “Why have You afflicted Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have laid the burden of all these people on me? </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_12"><sup>12</sup>Did I conceive all these people? Did I beget them, that You should say to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 40:11">⚓</a>‘Carry them in your bosom, as a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 49:23; 1 Thess. 2:7">⚓</a>guardian carries a nursing child,’ to the land which You <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:3">⚓</a>swore to their fathers? </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:33; Mark 8:4">⚓</a>Where am I to get meat to give to all these people? For they weep all over me, saying, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’ </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:18; Deut. 1:12">⚓</a>I am not able to bear all these people alone, because the burden <i>is</i> too heavy for me. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_15"><sup>15</sup>If You treat me like this, please kill me here and now—if I have found favor in Your sight—and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 3:17">⚓</a>do not let me see my wretchedness!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Seventy Elders</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_11_16"> <sup>16</sup>So the Lord said to Moses: “Gather to Me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:25; 24:1, 9">⚓</a>seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 16:18">⚓</a>officers over them; bring them to the tabernacle of meeting, that they may stand there with you. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_17"><sup>17</sup>Then I will come down and talk with you there. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:6; 2 Kin. 2:15; (Joel 2:28)">⚓</a>I will take of the Spirit that <i>is</i> upon you and will put <i>the</i> <i>same</i> upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you may not bear <i>it</i> yourself alone. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_18"><sup>18</sup>Then you shall say to the people, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:7">⚓</a>in the hearing of the Lord, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? For <i>it</i> <i>was</i> well with us in Egypt.” Therefore the Lord will give you meat, and you shall eat. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_19"><sup>19</sup>You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days, </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:29; 106:15">⚓</a>but <i>for</i> a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:19">⚓</a>despised the Lord who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:5">⚓</a>“Why did we ever come up out of Egypt?” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_11_21"> <sup>21</sup>And Moses said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:2; Ex. 12:37; Num. 1:46; 2:32">⚓</a>“The people whom I <i>am</i> among <i>are</i> six hundred thousand men on foot; yet You have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat <i>for</i> a whole month.’ </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 7:2">⚓</a>Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to provide enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to provide enough for them?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_11_23"> <sup>23</sup>And the Lord said to Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 50:2; 59:1">⚓</a>“Has the Lord’s arm been shortened? Now you shall see whether <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:19">⚓</a>what I say will happen to you or not.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_11_24"> <sup>24</sup>So Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord, and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:16">⚓</a>gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tabernacle. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_25"><sup>25</sup>Then the Lord came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that <i>was</i> upon him, and placed <i>the</i> <i>same</i> upon the seventy elders; and it happened, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:15">⚓</a>when the Spirit rested upon them, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:5, 6, 10; Joel 2:28; Acts 2:17, 18; 1 Cor. 14:1">⚓</a>they prophesied, although they never did <i>so</i> again.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_11_26"> <sup>26</sup>But two men had remained in the camp: the name of one <i>was</i> Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. Now they <i>were</i> among those listed, but who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 36:5">⚓</a>had not gone out to the tabernacle; yet they prophesied in the camp. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_27"><sup>27</sup>And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_11_28"> <sup>28</sup>So Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, <i>one</i> of his choice men, answered and said, “Moses my lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mark 9:38–40; Luke 9:49)">⚓</a>forbid them!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_11_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then Moses said to him, “Are you zealous for my sake? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 14:5">⚓</a>Oh, that all the Lord’s people were prophets <i>and</i> that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them!” </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_30"><sup>30</sup>And Moses returned to the camp, he and the elders of Israel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Lord Sends Quail</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_11_31"> <sup>31</sup>Now a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:13; Ps. 78:26–28; 105:40">⚓</a>wind went out from the Lord, and it brought quail from the sea and left <i>them</i> fluttering near the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and about a day’s journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the ground. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_32"><sup>32</sup>And the people stayed up all that day, all night, and all the next day, and gathered the quail (he who gathered least gathered ten <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:36; Ezek. 45:11">⚓</a>homers); and they spread <i>them</i> out for themselves all around the camp. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_33"><sup>33</sup>But while the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:29–31; 106:15">⚓</a>meat <i>was</i> still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was aroused against the people, and the Lord struck the people with a very great plague. </span>
<span class="verse dan_11_34"><sup>34</sup>So he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had yielded to craving.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_11_35"> <sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:17">⚓</a>From Kibroth Hattaavah the people moved to Hazeroth, and camped at Hazeroth.<br/></span>
