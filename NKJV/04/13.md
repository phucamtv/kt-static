<span class="verse dan_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:8; Deut. 1:22; 9:23">⚓</a>“Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel; from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a leader among them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_13_3"> <sup>3</sup>So Moses sent them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:16; 32:8; Deut. 1:19; 9:23">⚓</a>from the Wilderness of Paran according to the command of the Lord, all of them men who <i>were</i> heads of the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_4"><sup>4</sup>Now these <i>were</i> their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur; </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_5"><sup>5</sup>from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori; </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 34:19">⚓</a>from the tribe of Judah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:6, 30; Josh. 14:6, 7; Judg. 1:12; 1 Chr. 4:15">⚓</a>Caleb the son of Jephunneh; </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_7"><sup>7</sup>from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph; </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_8"><sup>8</sup>from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun; </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_9"><sup>9</sup>from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu; </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_10"><sup>10</sup>from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi; </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_11"><sup>11</sup>from the tribe of Joseph, <i>that</i> <i>is,</i> from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi; </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_12"><sup>12</sup>from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli; </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_13"><sup>13</sup>from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael; </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_14"><sup>14</sup>from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi; </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_15"><sup>15</sup>from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_13_16"> <sup>16</sup>These <i>are</i> the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:9; Deut. 32:44">⚓</a>Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_13_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this <i>way</i> into the South, and go up to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:9">⚓</a>the mountains, </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_18"><sup>18</sup>and see what the land is like: whether the people who dwell in it <i>are</i> strong or weak, few or many; </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_19"><sup>19</sup>whether the land they dwell in <i>is</i> good or bad; whether the cities they inhabit <i>are</i> like camps or strongholds; </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_20"><sup>20</sup>whether the land <i>is</i> rich or poor; and whether there are forests there or not. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:6, 7, 23">⚓</a>Be of good courage. And bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time <i>was</i> the season of the first ripe grapes.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_13_21"> <sup>21</sup>So they went up and spied out the land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:1; 27:14; 33:36; Josh. 15:1">⚓</a>from the Wilderness of Zin as far as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:28">⚓</a>Rehob, near the entrance of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 34:8; Josh. 13:5">⚓</a>Hamath. </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_22"><sup>22</sup>And they went up through the South and came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:13, 14; Judg. 1:10">⚓</a>Hebron; Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 11:21, 22">⚓</a>Anak, <i>were</i> there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:13; Num. 13:24; 32:9; Deut. 1:24, 25">⚓</a>Then they came to the Valley of Eshcol, and there cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes; they carried it between two of them on a pole. <i>They</i> also <i>brought</i> some of the pomegranates and figs. </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_24"><sup>24</sup>The place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the men of Israel cut down there. </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_25"><sup>25</sup>And they returned from spying out the land after forty days.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_13_26"> <sup>26</sup>Now they departed and came back to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel in the Wilderness of Paran, at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:1, 16; 32:8; 33:36; Deut. 1:19; Josh. 14:6">⚓</a>Kadesh; they brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_27"><sup>27</sup>Then they told him, and said: “We went to the land where you sent us. It truly flows with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:8, 17; 13:5; 33:3">⚓</a>milk and honey, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:25">⚓</a>and this <i>is</i> its fruit. </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_28"><sup>28</sup>Nevertheless the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:28; 9:1, 2">⚓</a>people who dwell in the land <i>are</i> strong; the cities <i>are</i> fortified <i>and</i> very large; moreover we saw the descendants of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 11:21, 22">⚓</a>Anak there. </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_29"><sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:8; Judg. 6:3">⚓</a>The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South; the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and along the banks of the Jordan.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_13_30"> <sup>30</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:6, 24">⚓</a>Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, “Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_13_31"> <sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:9; Deut. 1:28; 9:1–3; Josh. 14:8">⚓</a>But the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, for they <i>are</i> stronger than we.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_32"><sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:36, 37; Ps. 106:24">⚓</a>And they gave the children of Israel a bad report of the land which they had spied out, saying, “The land through which we have gone as spies <i>is</i> a land that devours its inhabitants, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 2:9">⚓</a>all the people whom we saw in it <i>are</i> men of <i>great</i> stature. </span>
<span class="verse dan_13_33"><sup>33</sup>There we saw the giants (<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:28; 9:2; Josh. 11:21">⚓</a>the descendants of Anak came from the giants); and we were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 40:22">⚓</a>like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:42">⚓</a>in their sight.”<br/></span>
