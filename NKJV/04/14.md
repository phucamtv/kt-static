<span class="verse dan_14_1"> <sup>1</sup>So all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried, and the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:4; Deut. 1:45">⚓</a>wept that night. </span>
<span class="verse dan_14_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:2; 17:3; Num. 16:41; Ps. 106:25; 1 Cor. 10:10">⚓</a>And all the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, “If only we had died in the land of Egypt! Or if only we had died in this wilderness! </span>
<span class="verse dan_14_3"><sup>3</sup>Why has the Lord brought us to this land to fall by the sword, that our wives and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:31; Deut. 1:39">⚓</a>children should become victims? Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?” </span>
<span class="verse dan_14_4"><sup>4</sup>So they said to one another, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:17">⚓</a>“Let us select a leader and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:16; Acts 7:39">⚓</a>return to Egypt.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_14_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_14_6"> <sup>6</sup>But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, <i>who</i> <i>were</i> among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes; </span>
<span class="verse dan_14_7"><sup>7</sup>and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:27; Deut. 1:25">⚓</a>“The land we passed through to spy out <i>is</i> an exceedingly good land. </span>
<span class="verse dan_14_8"><sup>8</sup>If the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 10:15; 2 Sam. 15:25, 26; 1 Kin. 10:9; Ps. 147:11">⚓</a>delights in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:8; Num. 13:27">⚓</a>‘a land which flows with milk and honey.’ </span>
<span class="verse dan_14_9"><sup>9</sup>Only <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:26; 9:7, 23, 24; 1 Sam. 15:23">⚓</a>do not rebel against the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:18">⚓</a>nor fear the people of the land, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 24:8">⚓</a>they <i>are</i> our bread; their protection has departed from them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:21; Ex. 33:16; Deut. 20:1, 3, 4; 31:6–8; Josh. 1:5; Judg. 1:22; 2 Chr. 13:12; Ps. 46:7, 11; Zech. 8:23; Matt. 28:20; Heb. 13:5">⚓</a>and the Lord<i>is</i> with us.

<span class="verse dan_14_10"> <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:4">⚓</a>And all the congregation said to stone them with stones.

<div class="title"><h3>Moses Intercedes for the People</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_14_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses: “How long will these people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 95:8; Heb. 3:8">⚓</a>reject Me?

<span class="verse dan_14_12"><sup>12</sup>I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:10">⚓</a>make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_14_13"> <sup>13</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 106:23">⚓</a>Moses said to the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:12; Deut. 9:26–28; 32:27">⚓</a>“Then the Egyptians will hear <i>it,</i> for by Your might You brought these people up from among them, </span>

<span class="verse dan_14_15"><sup>15</sup>Now <i>if</i> You kill these people as one man, then the nations which have heard of Your fame will speak, saying, </span>
<span class="verse dan_14_16"><sup>16</sup>‘Because the Lord was not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:28">⚓</a>able to bring this people to the land which He swore to give them, therefore He killed them in the wilderness.’ </span>
<span class="verse dan_14_17"><sup>17</sup>And now, I pray, let the power of my Lord be great, just as You have spoken, saying, </span>

<span class="verse dan_14_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then the Lord said: “I have pardoned, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:13; Mic. 7:18–20; (1 John 5:14–16)">⚓</a>according to your word; </span>

<span class="verse dan_14_23"><sup>23</sup>they certainly shall not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:65; 32:11; Heb. 3:18">⚓</a>see the land of which I swore to their fathers, nor shall any of those who rejected Me see it. </span>
<span class="verse dan_14_24"><sup>24</sup>But My servant <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 14:6, 8, 9">⚓</a>Caleb, because he has a different spirit in him and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:12">⚓</a>has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land where he went, and his descendants shall inherit it. </span>

<div class="title"><h3>Death Sentence on the Rebels</h3></div>

<span class="verse dan_14_36"> <sup>36</sup>Now the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation complain against him by bringing a bad report of the land, </span>

<span class="verse dan_14_39"> <sup>39</sup>Then Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:4">⚓</a>and the people mourned greatly. </span>
<span class="verse dan_14_40"><sup>40</sup>And they rose early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:41–44">⚓</a>“Here we are, and we will go up to the place which the Lord has promised, for we have sinned!”<br/></span>
