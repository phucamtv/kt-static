<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>Rebellion Against Moses and Aaron</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:21">⚓</a>Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:9; Deut. 11:6">⚓</a>Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took <i>men;</i></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_2"><sup>2</sup>and they rose up before Moses with some of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 1:16; 26:9">⚓</a>representatives of the congregation, men of renown. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:2; 14:2; Ps. 106:16">⚓</a>They gathered together against Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “<i>You</i> take too much upon yourselves, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:6">⚓</a>all the congregation <i>is</i> holy, every one of them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:45">⚓</a>and the Lord<i>is</i> among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the Lord?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_4"> <sup>4</sup>So when Moses heard <i>it,</i> he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:5; 20:6">⚓</a>fell on his face; </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_5"><sup>5</sup>and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying, “Tomorrow morning the Lord will show who <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Tim. 2:19)">⚓</a>His and <i>who</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 21:6–8, 12">⚓</a>holy, and will cause <i>him</i> to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:46; 44:15, 16">⚓</a>come near to Him. That one whom He chooses He will cause to come near to Him. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_6"><sup>6</sup>Do this: Take censers, Korah and all your company; </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_7"><sup>7</sup>put fire in them and put incense in them before the Lord tomorrow, and it shall be <i>that</i> the man whom the Lord chooses <i>is</i> the holy one. <i>You</i> <i>take</i> too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi: </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_9"><sup>9</sup><i>Is</i> <i>it</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:23; Is. 7:13">⚓</a>a small thing to you that the God of Israel has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 3:41, 45; 8:13–16; Deut. 10:8">⚓</a>separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the work of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the congregation to serve them; </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_10"><sup>10</sup>and that He has brought you near <i>to</i> <i>Himself,</i> you and all your brethren, the sons of Levi, with you? And are you seeking the priesthood also? </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_11"><sup>11</sup>Therefore you and all your company <i>are</i> gathered together against the Lord. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:7, 8">⚓</a>And what <i>is</i> Aaron that you complain against him?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_12"> <sup>12</sup>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come up! </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_13"><sup>13</sup><i>Is</i> <i>it</i> a small thing that you have brought us up out of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:3; Num. 11:4–6">⚓</a>a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you should <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:14; Acts 7:27, 35">⚓</a>keep acting like a prince over us? </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_14"><sup>14</sup>Moreover <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:1–4">⚓</a>you have not brought us into <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:8; Lev. 20:24">⚓</a>a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then Moses was very angry, and said to the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:4, 5">⚓</a>“Do not respect their offering. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:3; Acts 20:33">⚓</a>I have not taken one donkey from them, nor have I hurt one of them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_16"> <sup>16</sup>And Moses said to Korah, “Tomorrow, you and all your company be present <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:3, 7">⚓</a>before the Lord—you and they, as well as Aaron. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_17"><sup>17</sup>Let each take his censer and put incense in it, and each of you bring his censer before the Lord, two hundred and fifty censers; both you and Aaron, each <i>with</i> his censer.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_18"><sup>18</sup>So every man took his censer, put fire in it, laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the tabernacle of meeting with Moses and Aaron. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_19"><sup>19</sup>And Korah gathered all the congregation against them at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:7, 10; Lev. 9:6, 23; Num. 14:10">⚓</a>the glory of the Lord appeared to all the congregation.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_20"> <sup>20</sup>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:17; Jer. 51:6">⚓</a>“Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:10; 33:5">⚓</a>consume them in a moment.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:5">⚓</a>fell on their faces, and said, “O God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:16; Job 12:10; Eccl. 12:7; Heb. 12:9">⚓</a>the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and You be angry with all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:23–32; 20:4">⚓</a>congregation?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_23"> <sup>23</sup>So the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_24"><sup>24</sup>“Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_26"><sup>26</sup>And he spoke to the congregation, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:12, 14, 15, 17">⚓</a>“Depart now from the tents of these wicked men! Touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_27"><sup>27</sup>So they got away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, their sons, and their little <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:5; Num. 26:11">⚓</a>children.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_28"> <sup>28</sup>And Moses said: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:12; John 5:36">⚓</a>“By this you shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works, for <i>I</i> <i>have</i> not <i>done</i> <i>them</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 24:13; John 5:30">⚓</a>of my own will. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_29"><sup>29</sup>If these men die naturally like all men, or if they are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:5; Job 35:15; Is. 10:3">⚓</a>visited by the common fate of all men, <i>then</i> the Lord has not sent me. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_30"><sup>30</sup>But if the Lord creates <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 31:3; Is. 28:21">⚓</a>a new thing, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 55:15)">⚓</a>go down alive into the pit, then you will understand that these men have rejected the Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_31"> <sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:10; Ps. 106:17">⚓</a>Now it came to pass, as he finished speaking all these words, that the ground split apart under them, </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_32"><sup>32</sup>and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:11; 1 Chr. 6:22, 37">⚓</a>all the men with Korah, with all <i>their</i> goods. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_33"><sup>33</sup>So they and all those with them went down alive into the pit; the earth closed over them, and they perished from among the assembly. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_34"><sup>34</sup>Then all Israel who <i>were</i> around them fled at their cry, for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up <i>also!</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_35"> <sup>35</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 10:2; Num. 11:1–3; 26:10; Ps. 106:18">⚓</a>a fire came out from the Lord and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering incense.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_36"> <sup>36</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_37"><sup>37</sup>“Tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to pick up the censers out of the blaze, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 27:28">⚓</a>they are holy, and scatter the fire some distance away. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_38"><sup>38</sup>The censers of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 20:2; Hab. 2:10">⚓</a>these men who sinned against their own souls, let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar. Because they presented them before the Lord, therefore they are holy; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 17:10; Ezek. 14:8">⚓</a>and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_39"><sup>39</sup>So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned up had presented, and they were hammered out as a covering on the altar, </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_40"><sup>40</sup><i>to</i> <i>be</i> a memorial to the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 3:10; 2 Chr. 26:18">⚓</a>that no outsider, who <i>is</i> not a descendant of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the Lord, that he might not become like Korah and his companions, just as the Lord had said to him through Moses.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Complaints of the People</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_16_41"> <sup>41</sup>On the next day <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:2; Ps. 106:25">⚓</a>all the congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of the Lord.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_42"><sup>42</sup>Now it happened, when the congregation had gathered against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tabernacle of meeting; and suddenly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 40:34">⚓</a>the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_43"><sup>43</sup>Then Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of meeting.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_44"> <sup>44</sup>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_45"><sup>45</sup>“Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.”<br/> And they fell on their faces.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_16_46"> <sup>46</sup>So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a censer and put fire in it from the altar, put incense <i>on</i> <i>it,</i> and take it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 10:6; Num. 18:5">⚓</a>for wrath has gone out from the Lord. The plague has begun.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_47"><sup>47</sup>Then Aaron took <i>it</i> as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and already the plague had begun among the people. So he put in the incense and made atonement for the people. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_48"><sup>48</sup>And he stood between the dead and the living; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 25:8; Ps. 106:30">⚓</a>so the plague was stopped. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_49"><sup>49</sup>Now those who died in the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died in the Korah incident. </span>
<span class="verse dan_16_50"><sup>50</sup>So Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tabernacle of meeting, for the plague had stopped.<br/></span>
