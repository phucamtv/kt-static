<div class="title"><h1>17</h1><h3>The Budding of Aaron’s Rod</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: </span>
<span class="verse dan_17_2"><sup>2</sup>“Speak to the children of Israel, and get from them a rod from each father’s house, all their leaders according to their fathers’ houses—twelve rods. Write each man’s name on his rod. </span>
<span class="verse dan_17_3"><sup>3</sup>And you shall write Aaron’s name on the rod of Levi. For there shall be one rod for the head of <i>each</i> father’s house. </span>
<span class="verse dan_17_4"><sup>4</sup>Then you shall place them in the tabernacle of meeting before <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:16">⚓</a>the Testimony, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:22; 29:42, 43; 30:36; Num. 17:7">⚓</a>where I meet with you. </span>
<span class="verse dan_17_5"><sup>5</sup>And it shall be <i>that</i> the rod of the man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:5">⚓</a>whom I choose will blossom; thus I will rid Myself of the complaints of the children of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:11">⚓</a>which they make against you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_17_6"> <sup>6</sup>So Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and each of their leaders gave him a rod apiece, for each leader according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron <i>was</i> among their rods. </span>
<span class="verse dan_17_7"><sup>7</sup>And Moses placed the rods before the Lord in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 38:21; Num. 1:50, 51; 9:15; 18:2; Acts 7:44">⚓</a>the tabernacle of witness.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_17_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now it came to pass on the next day that Moses went into the tabernacle of witness, and behold, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ezek. 17:24); Heb. 9:4">⚓</a>rod of Aaron, of the house of Levi, had sprouted and put forth buds, had produced blossoms and yielded ripe almonds. </span>
<span class="verse dan_17_9"><sup>9</sup>Then Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord to all the children of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his rod.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_17_10"> <sup>10</sup>And the Lord said to Moses, “Bring <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 9:4">⚓</a>Aaron’s rod back before the Testimony, to be kept <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:38; Deut. 9:7, 24">⚓</a>as a sign against the rebels, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 17:5">⚓</a>that you may put their complaints away from Me, lest they die.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_17_11"><sup>11</sup>Thus did Moses; just as the Lord had commanded him, so he did.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_17_12"> <sup>12</sup>So the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, “Surely we die, we perish, we all perish! </span>
<span class="verse dan_17_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 1:51, 53; 18:4, 7">⚓</a>Whoever even comes near the tabernacle of the Lord must die. Shall we all utterly die?”<br/></span>
