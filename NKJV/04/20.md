<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>Moses’ Error at Kadesh</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:21; 33:36">⚓</a> the children of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the Wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:26">⚓</a>Kadesh; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:20; Num. 26:59">⚓</a>Miriam died there and was buried there.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_20_2"> <sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:1">⚓</a>Now there was no water for the congregation; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:19, 42">⚓</a>so they gathered together against Moses and Aaron. </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_3"><sup>3</sup>And the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:2; Num. 14:2">⚓</a>contended with Moses and spoke, saying: “If only we had died <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:1, 33; 14:37; 16:31–35, 49">⚓</a>when our brethren died before the Lord! </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:3">⚓</a>Why have you brought up the assembly of the Lord into this wilderness, that we and our animals should die here? </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_5"><sup>5</sup>And why have you made us come up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? It <i>is</i> not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates; nor <i>is</i> there any water to drink.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_6"><sup>6</sup>So Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of meeting, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:5; 16:4, 22, 45">⚓</a>they fell on their faces. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:10">⚓</a>the glory of the Lord appeared to them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_20_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:17, 20; 17:5, 6">⚓</a>“Take the rod; you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation together. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will yield its water; thus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:15; Ps. 78:15, 16; 105:41; Is. 43:20; 48:21; (1 Cor. 10:4)">⚓</a>you shall bring water for them out of the rock, and give drink to the congregation and their animals.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_9"><sup>9</sup>So Moses took the rod <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 17:10">⚓</a>from before the Lord as He commanded him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_20_10"> <sup>10</sup>And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock; and he said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 106:33">⚓</a>“Hear now, you rebels! Must we bring water for you out of this rock?” </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_11"><sup>11</sup>Then Moses lifted his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:6; Deut. 8:15; Ps. 78:16; Is. 48:21; (1 Cor. 10:4)">⚓</a>and water came out abundantly, and the congregation and their animals drank.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_20_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, “Because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:28; 27:14; Deut. 1:37; 3:26, 27; 34:5">⚓</a>you did not believe Me, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 10:3; Ezek. 20:41; 36:23; 1 Pet. 3:15">⚓</a>hallow Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_20_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:8; Ps. 106:32">⚓</a>This <i>was</i> the water of Meribah, because the children of Israel contended with the Lord, and He was hallowed among them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Passage Through Edom Refused</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_20_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:16, 17">⚓</a>Now Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 36:31–39">⚓</a>Edom. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:4; Obad. 10–12">⚓</a>“Thus says your brother Israel: ‘You know all the hardship that has befallen us, </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:6; Acts 7:15">⚓</a>how our fathers went down to Egypt, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:40">⚓</a>and we dwelt in Egypt a long time, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:11; Deut. 26:6; Acts 7:19">⚓</a>and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers. </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:23; 3:7">⚓</a>When we cried out to the Lord, He heard our voice and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:2; 14:19">⚓</a>sent the Angel and brought us up out of Egypt; now here we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your border. </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_17"><sup>17</sup>Please <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:22">⚓</a>let us pass through your country. We will not pass through fields or vineyards, nor will we drink water from wells; we will go along the King’s Highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left until we have passed through your territory.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_20_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 24:18; Ps. 137:7; Ezek. 25:12, 13; Obad. 10–15">⚓</a>Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through my <i>land,</i> lest I come out against you with the sword.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_20_19"> <sup>19</sup>So the children of Israel said to him, “We will go by the Highway, and if I or my livestock drink any of your water, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:6, 28">⚓</a>then I will pay for it; let me only pass through on foot, nothing <i>more.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_20_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:17">⚓</a>“You shall not pass through.” So Edom came out against them with many men and with a strong hand. </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_21"><sup>21</sup>Thus Edom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:27, 30">⚓</a>refused to give Israel passage through his territory; so Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:8; Judg. 11:18">⚓</a>turned away from him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Aaron</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_20_22"> <sup>22</sup>Now the children of Israel, the whole congregation, journeyed from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:37">⚓</a>Kadesh <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:4">⚓</a>and came to Mount Hor. </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_23"><sup>23</sup>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying: </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_24"><sup>24</sup>“Aaron shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:8; Deut. 32:50">⚓</a>gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against My word at the water of Meribah. </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_25"><sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:38; Deut. 32:50">⚓</a>Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor; </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_26"><sup>26</sup>and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; for Aaron shall be gathered <i>to</i> <i>his</i> <i>people</i> and die there.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_27"><sup>27</sup>So Moses did just as the Lord commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_28"><sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:29, 30; Deut. 10:6">⚓</a>Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:38">⚓</a>Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. </span>
<span class="verse dan_20_29"><sup>29</sup>Now when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, all the house of Israel mourned for Aaron <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:3, 10; Deut. 34:8">⚓</a>thirty days.<br/></span>
