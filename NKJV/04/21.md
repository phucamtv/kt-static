<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>Canaanites Defeated at Hormah</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>The <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:40; Josh. 12:14; Judg. 1:16">⚓</a>king of Arad, the Canaanite, who dwelt in the South, heard that Israel was coming on the road to Atharim. Then he fought against Israel and took <i>some</i> of them prisoners. </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:20; Judg. 11:30">⚓</a>So Israel made a vow to the Lord, and said, “If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:34">⚓</a>I will utterly destroy their cities.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_3"><sup>3</sup>And the Lord listened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. So the name of that place was called Hormah.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Bronze Serpent</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_21_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then they journeyed from Mount Hor by the Way of the Red Sea, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:18">⚓</a>go around the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became very discouraged on the way. </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_5"><sup>5</sup>And the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:4, 5">⚓</a>spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no food and no water, and our soul loathes this worthless bread.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_6"><sup>6</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 10:9">⚓</a>the Lord sent <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:15">⚓</a>fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many of the people of Israel died.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_21_7"> <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:2; Ps. 78:34; Is. 26:16; Hos. 5:15">⚓</a>Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, “We have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:40">⚓</a>sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and against you; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:8; 1 Sam. 12:19; 1 Kin. 13:6; Acts 8:24">⚓</a>pray to the Lord that He take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_21_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 3:14, 15)">⚓</a>“Make a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 14:29; 30:6">⚓</a>fiery <i>serpent,</i> and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_9"><sup>9</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:4; John 3:14, 15">⚓</a>Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>From Mount Hor to Moab</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_21_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now the children of Israel moved on and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:43, 44">⚓</a>camped in Oboth. </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_11"><sup>11</sup>And they journeyed from Oboth and camped at Ije Abarim, in the wilderness which <i>is</i> east of Moab, toward the sunrise. </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:13">⚓</a>From there they moved and camped in the Valley of Zered. </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_13"><sup>13</sup>From there they moved and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which <i>is</i> in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:36; Judg. 11:18">⚓</a>the Arnon <i>is</i> the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_14"><sup>14</sup>Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the Lord:<br/>  “Waheb in Suphah,<br/>   The brooks of the Arnon,<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_21_15">   <sup>15</sup>And the slope of the brooks<br/>   That reaches to the dwelling of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:28; Deut. 2:9, 18, 29">⚓</a>Ar,<br/>   And lies on the border of Moab.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_21_16"> <sup>16</sup>From there <i>they</i> <i>went</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:21">⚓</a>to Beer, which <i>is</i> the well where the Lord said to Moses, “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_17"><sup>17</sup>Then Israel sang this song:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:1">⚓</a>“Spring up, O well!<br/>   All of you sing to it—<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_21_18">   <sup>18</sup>The well the leaders sank,<br/>   Dug by the nation’s nobles,<br/>   By the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 33:22">⚓</a>lawgiver, with their staves.”<br/> And from the wilderness <i>they</i> <i>went</i> to Mattanah, </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_19"><sup>19</sup>from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth, </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_20"><sup>20</sup>and from Bamoth, <i>in</i> the valley that <i>is</i> in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah which looks <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:28">⚓</a>down on the wasteland.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>King Sihon Defeated</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_21_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:33; Deut. 2:26–37; Judg. 11:19">⚓</a>Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:16, 17">⚓</a>“Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into fields or vineyards; we will not drink water from wells. We will go by the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:7">⚓</a>But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel in the wilderness, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:32; Judg. 11:20">⚓</a>and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel. </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_24"><sup>24</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:33; Josh. 12:1; Neh. 9:22; Ps. 135:10; 136:19; Amos 2:9">⚓</a>Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the people of Ammon; for the border of the people of Ammon <i>was</i> fortified. </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_25"><sup>25</sup>So Israel took all these cities, and Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 2:10">⚓</a>dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all its villages. </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_26"><sup>26</sup>For Heshbon <i>was</i> the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and had taken all his land from his hand as far as the Arnon. </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_27"><sup>27</sup>Therefore those who speak in proverbs say:<br/>  “Come to Heshbon, let it be built;<br/>   Let the city of Sihon be repaired.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_21_28">  <sup>28</sup>“For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 48:45, 46">⚓</a>fire went out from Heshbon,<br/>   A flame from the city of Sihon;<br/>   It consumed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:9, 18; Is. 15:1">⚓</a>Ar of Moab,<br/>   The lords of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:41; 33:52">⚓</a>heights of the Arnon.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_21_29">   <sup>29</sup>Woe to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 48:46">⚓</a>Moab!<br/>   You have perished, O people of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:24; 1 Kin. 11:33; 2 Kin. 23:13">⚓</a>Chemosh!<br/>   He has given his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 15:2, 5">⚓</a>sons as fugitives,<br/>   And his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 16:2">⚓</a>daughters into captivity,<br/>   To Sihon king of the Amorites.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_21_30">  <sup>30</sup>“But we have shot at them;<br/>   Heshbon has perished <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:3, 34; Jer. 48:18, 22">⚓</a>as far as Dibon.<br/>   Then we laid waste as far as Nophah,<br/>   Which <i>reaches</i> to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 15:2">⚓</a>Medeba.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_21_31"> <sup>31</sup>Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_32"><sup>32</sup>Then Moses sent to spy out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:1, 3, 35; Jer. 48:32">⚓</a>Jazer; and they took its villages and drove out the Amorites who <i>were</i> there.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>King Og Defeated</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_21_33"> <sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:7">⚓</a>And they turned and went up by the way to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:1">⚓</a>Bashan. So Og king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 13:12">⚓</a>at Edrei. </span>
<span class="verse dan_21_34"><sup>34</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:2">⚓</a>“Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people and his land; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:24; Ps. 135:10; 136:20">⚓</a>you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.” </span>
