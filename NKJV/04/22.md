<div class="title"><h1>22</h1><h3>Balak Sends for Balaam</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_22_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:48, 49">⚓</a>the children of Israel moved, and camped in the plains of Moab on the side of the Jordan <i>across</i> <i>from</i> Jericho.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_2"> <sup>2</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:9; Judg. 11:25; Mic. 6:5; Rev. 2:14">⚓</a>Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_3"><sup>3</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:15">⚓</a>Moab was exceedingly afraid of the people because they <i>were</i> many, and Moab was sick with dread because of the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_4"><sup>4</sup>So Moab said to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 25:15–18; 31:1–3; Josh. 13:21">⚓</a>the elders of Midian, “Now this company will lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” And Balak the son of Zippor <i>was</i> king of the Moabites at that time. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_5"><sup>5</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 31:8, 16; Deut. 23:4; Josh. 13:22; 24:9; Neh. 13:1, 2; Mic. 6:5; 2 Pet. 2:15; Jude 11; Rev. 2:14">⚓</a>he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 23:4">⚓</a>Pethor, which <i>is</i> near the River in the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying: “Look, a people has come from Egypt. See, they cover the face of the earth, and are settling next to me! </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:17; 23:7, 8">⚓</a>Therefore please come at once, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:12; 24:9">⚓</a>curse this people for me, for they <i>are</i> too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land, for I know that he whom you bless <i>is</i> blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_7"> <sup>7</sup>So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:7, 8">⚓</a>diviner’s fee in their hand, and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_8"><sup>8</sup>And he said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:19">⚓</a>“Lodge here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, as the Lord speaks to me.” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:3">⚓</a>Then God came to Balaam and said, “Who <i>are</i> these men with you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_10"> <sup>10</sup>So Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, <i>saying,</i></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_11"><sup>11</sup>‘Look, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the face of the earth. Come now, curse them for me; perhaps I shall be able to overpower them and drive them out.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_12"> <sup>12</sup>And God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:20; (Rom. 11:28)">⚓</a>they <i>are</i> blessed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_13"> <sup>13</sup>So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak, “Go back to your land, for the Lord has refused to give me permission to go with you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_14"> <sup>14</sup>And the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then Balak again sent princes, more numerous and more honorable than they. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_16"><sup>16</sup>And they came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me; </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_17"><sup>17</sup>for I will certainly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 24:11">⚓</a>honor you greatly, and I will do whatever you say to me. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:6">⚓</a>Therefore please come, curse this people for me.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:38; 24:13">⚓</a>“Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:14; 2 Chr. 18:13">⚓</a>I could not go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to do less or more. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_19"><sup>19</sup>Now therefore, please, you also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:8">⚓</a>stay here tonight, that I may know what more the Lord will say to me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:9">⚓</a>And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men come to call you, rise <i>and</i> go with them; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:35; 23:5, 12, 16, 26; 24:13">⚓</a>only the word which I speak to you—that you shall do.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_21"><sup>21</sup>So Balaam rose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Balaam, the Donkey, and the Angel</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_22_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then God’s anger was aroused because he went, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:24">⚓</a>and the Angel of the Lord took His stand in the way as an adversary against him. And he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants <i>were</i> with him. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_23"><sup>23</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:13; 2 Kin. 6:17; Dan. 10:7; Acts 22:9">⚓</a>the donkey saw the Angel of the Lord standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, and the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. So Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_24"><sup>24</sup>Then the Angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, <i>with</i> a wall on this side and a wall on that side. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_25"><sup>25</sup>And when the donkey saw the Angel of the Lord, she pushed herself against the wall and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall; so he struck her again. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_26"><sup>26</sup>Then the Angel of the Lord went further, and stood in a narrow place where there <i>was</i> no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_27"><sup>27</sup>And when the donkey saw the Angel of the Lord, she lay down under Balaam; so Balaam’s anger was aroused, and he struck the donkey with his staff.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 2:16">⚓</a>opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_29"> <sup>29</sup>And Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have abused me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 12:10; Matt. 15:19)">⚓</a>for now I would kill you!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_30"> <sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 2:16">⚓</a>So the donkey said to Balaam, “<i>Am</i> I not your donkey on which you have ridden, ever since <i>I</i> <i>became</i> yours, to this day? Was I ever disposed to do this to you?”<br/> And he said, “No.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:19; 2 Kin. 6:17; Luke 24:16, 31">⚓</a>opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the Angel of the Lord standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand; and he bowed his head and fell flat on his face. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_32"><sup>32</sup>And the Angel of the Lord said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to stand against you, because <i>your</i> way is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Pet. 2:14, 15)">⚓</a>perverse before Me. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_33"><sup>33</sup>The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, surely I would also have killed you by now, and let her live.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_34"> <sup>34</sup>And Balaam said to the Angel of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:24, 30; 26:21; 2 Sam. 12:13">⚓</a>“I have sinned, for I did not know You stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases You, I will turn back.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_35"> <sup>35</sup>Then the Angel of the Lord said to Balaam, “Go with the men, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:20">⚓</a>but only the word that I speak to you, that you shall speak.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_36"> <sup>36</sup>Now when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:17">⚓</a>he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:13">⚓</a>which <i>is</i> on the border at the Arnon, the boundary of the territory. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_37"><sup>37</sup>Then Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not earnestly send to you, calling for you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:17; 24:11">⚓</a>to honor you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_22_38"> <sup>38</sup>And Balaam said to Balak, “Look, I have come to you! Now, have I any power at all to say anything? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:26; 24:13; 1 Kin. 22:14; 2 Chr. 18:13">⚓</a>The word that God puts in my mouth, that I must speak.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_39"><sup>39</sup>So Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath Huzoth. </span>
<span class="verse dan_22_40"><sup>40</sup>Then Balak offered oxen and sheep, and he sent <i>some</i> to Balaam and to the princes who <i>were</i> with him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Balaam’s First Prophecy</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_22_41"> <sup>41</sup>So it was, the next day, that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:28; Deut. 12:2">⚓</a>high places of Baal, that from there he might observe the extent of the people.<br/></span>
