<span class="verse dan_23_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Balaam said to Balak, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:29">⚓</a>“Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_2"> <sup>2</sup>And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:14, 30">⚓</a>offered a bull and a ram on <i>each</i> altar. </span>
<span class="verse dan_23_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Balaam said to Balak, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:15">⚓</a>“Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the Lord will come <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:4, 16">⚓</a>to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you.” So he went to a desolate height. </span>
<span class="verse dan_23_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:16">⚓</a>And God met Balaam, and he said to Him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered on <i>each</i> altar a bull and a ram.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:20, 35, 38; 23:16; Deut. 18:18; Jer. 1:9">⚓</a>put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_23_6"><sup>6</sup>So he returned to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, he and all the princes of Moab.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_7"> <sup>7</sup>And he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 23:4; Job 27:1; 29:1; Ps. 78:2">⚓</a>took up his oracle and said:<br/>  “Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram,<br/>   From the mountains of the east.<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:6, 11, 17">⚓</a>‘Come, curse Jacob for me,<br/>   And come, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:10">⚓</a>denounce Israel!’<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_8">  <sup>8</sup>“How<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:12">⚓</a> shall I curse whom God has not cursed?<br/>   And how shall I denounce <i>whom</i> the Lord has not denounced?<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_9">   <sup>9</sup>For from the top of the rocks I see him,<br/>   And from the hills I behold him;<br/>   There! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:8; 33:28; Josh. 11:23">⚓</a>A people dwelling alone,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:16; Ezra 9:2; (Eph. 2:14)">⚓</a>Not reckoning itself among the nations.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_10">  <sup>10</sup>“Who<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:16; 22:17; 28:14; 2 Chr. 1:9">⚓</a> can count the dust of Jacob,<br/>   Or number one-fourth of Israel?<br/>   Let me die <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 116:15">⚓</a>the death of the righteous,<br/>   And let my end be like his!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:11">⚓</a>I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have blessed <i>them</i> bountifully!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_12"> <sup>12</sup>So he answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:38">⚓</a>“Must I not take heed to speak what the Lord has put in my mouth?”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Balaam’s Second Prophecy</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_23_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place from which you may see them; you shall see only the outer part of them, and shall not see them all; curse them for me from there.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_23_14"><sup>14</sup>So he brought him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:1, 2">⚓</a>and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on <i>each</i> altar.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_15"> <sup>15</sup>And he said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet <i>the</i> <i>Lord</i> over there.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then the Lord met Balaam, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:35; 23:5">⚓</a>put a word in his mouth, and said, “Go back to Balak, and thus you shall speak.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_23_17"><sup>17</sup>So he came to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab were with him. And Balak said to him, “What has the Lord spoken?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then he took up his oracle and said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:20">⚓</a>“Rise up, Balak, and hear!<br/>   Listen to me, son of Zippor!<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_19">  <sup>19</sup>“God<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:29; Mal. 3:6; James 1:17">⚓</a><i>is</i> not a man, that He should lie,<br/>   Nor a son of man, that He should repent.<br/>   Has He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:23; 1 Kin. 8:56">⚓</a>said, and will He not do?<br/>   Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_20">   <sup>20</sup>Behold, I have received <i>a</i> <i>command</i> to bless;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:2; 22:17; Num. 22:12">⚓</a>He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_21">  <sup>21</sup>“He<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 32:2; (Rom. 4:7, 8)">⚓</a> has not observed iniquity in Jacob,<br/>   Nor has He seen wickedness in Israel.<br/>   The Lord his God <i>is</i> with him,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 89:15–18">⚓</a>And the shout of a King <i>is</i> among them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_22">   <sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 24:8">⚓</a>God brings them out of Egypt;<br/>   He has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:17; Job 39:10">⚓</a>strength like a wild ox.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_23">  <sup>23</sup>“For <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no sorcery against Jacob,<br/>   Nor any divination against Israel.<br/>   It now must be said of Jacob<br/>   And of Israel, ‘Oh, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 31:19; 44:1">⚓</a>what God has done!’<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_24">   <sup>24</sup>Look, a people rises <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:9">⚓</a>like a lioness,<br/>   And lifts itself up like a lion;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:27; Josh. 11:23">⚓</a>It shall not lie down until it devours the prey,<br/>   And drinks the blood of the slain.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_23_26"> <sup>26</sup>So Balaam answered and said to Balak, “Did I not tell you, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:38">⚓</a>‘All that the Lord speaks, that I must do’?”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Balaam’s Third Prophecy</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_23_27"> <sup>27</sup>Then Balak said to Balaam, “Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_23_28"><sup>28</sup>So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:20">⚓</a>overlooks the wasteland. </span>
<span class="verse dan_23_29"><sup>29</sup>Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_23_30"><sup>30</sup>And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on <i>every</i> altar.<br/></span>
