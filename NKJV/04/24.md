<span class="verse dan_24_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not go as at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:3, 15">⚓</a>other times, to seek to use sorcery, but he set his face toward the wilderness. </span>
<span class="verse dan_24_2"><sup>2</sup>And Balaam raised his eyes, and saw Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 2:2, 34">⚓</a>encamped according to their tribes; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:25; 1 Sam. 10:10; 19:20, 23; 2 Chr. 15:1">⚓</a>the Spirit of God came upon him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_3"> <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:7, 18">⚓</a>Then he took up his oracle and said:<br/>  “The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor,<br/>   The utterance of the man whose eyes are opened,<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_4">   <sup>4</sup>The utterance of him who hears the words of God,<br/>   Who sees the vision of the Almighty,<br/>   Who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:28">⚓</a>falls down, with eyes wide open:<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_5">  <sup>5</sup>“How lovely are your tents, O Jacob!<br/>   Your dwellings, O Israel!<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_6">   <sup>6</sup>Like valleys that stretch out,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 1:3; Jer. 17:8">⚓</a>Like gardens by the riverside,<br/>   Like aloes <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 104:16">⚓</a>planted by the Lord,<br/>   Like cedars beside the waters.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_7">   <sup>7</sup>He shall pour water from his buckets,<br/>   And his seed <i>shall</i> <i>be</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 51:13; Rev. 17:1, 15">⚓</a>in many waters.<br/>  “His king shall be higher than <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:8, 9">⚓</a>Agag,<br/>   And his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:12; 1 Chr. 14:2">⚓</a>kingdom shall be exalted.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_8">  <sup>8</sup>“God<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:22">⚓</a> brings him out of Egypt;<br/>   He has strength like a wild ox;<br/>   He shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:9; 23:24">⚓</a>consume the nations, his enemies;<br/>   He shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:9; Jer. 50:17">⚓</a>break their bones<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 45:5">⚓</a>pierce <i>them</i> with his arrows.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_9">   <sup>9</sup>‘He<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:9; Num. 23:24">⚓</a> bows down, he lies down as a lion;<br/>   And as a lion, who shall rouse him?’<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:3; 27:29">⚓</a>“Blessed <i>is</i> he who blesses you,<br/>   And cursed <i>is</i> he who curses you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Balak’s anger was aroused against Balaam, and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 21:14, 17">⚓</a>struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:11; Neh. 13:2">⚓</a>“I called you to curse my enemies, and look, you have bountifully blessed <i>them</i> these three times! </span>
<span class="verse dan_24_11"><sup>11</sup>Now therefore, flee to your place. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:17, 37">⚓</a>I said I would greatly honor you, but in fact, the Lord has kept you back from honor.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_12"> <sup>12</sup>So Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse dan_24_13"><sup>13</sup>‘If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the Lord, to do good or bad of my own will. What the Lord says, that I must speak’? </span>
<span class="verse dan_24_14"><sup>14</sup>And now, indeed, I am going to my people.

<div class="title"><h3>Balaam’s Fourth Prophecy</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_24_15"> <sup>15</sup>So he took up his oracle and said:<br/>  “The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor,<br/>   And the utterance of the man whose eyes are opened;<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_16">   <sup>16</sup>The utterance of him who hears the words of God,<br/>   And has the knowledge of the Most High,<br/>   <i>Who</i> sees the vision of the Almighty,<br/>   <i>Who</i> falls down, with eyes wide open:<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_17">  <sup>17</sup>“I<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 1:7; Matt. 1:2; Luke 3:34">⚓</a> see Him, but not now;<br/>   I behold Him, but not near;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 2:2">⚓</a>A Star shall come out of Jacob;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:10">⚓</a>A Scepter shall rise out of Israel,<br/>   And batter the brow of Moab,<br/>   And destroy all the sons of tumult.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_18">  <sup>18</sup>“And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:14">⚓</a>Edom shall be a possession;<br/>   Seir also, his enemies, shall be a possession,<br/>   While Israel does valiantly.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_19">   <sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:10; Amos 9:11, 12">⚓</a>Out of Jacob One shall have dominion,<br/>   And destroy the remains of the city.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then he looked on Amalek, and he took up his oracle and said:<br/>  “Amalek <i>was</i> first among the nations,<br/>   But <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> last until he perishes.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then he looked on the Kenites, and he took up his oracle and said:<br/>  “Firm is your dwelling place,<br/>   And your nest is set in the rock;<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_22">   <sup>22</sup>Nevertheless Kain shall be burned.<br/>   How long until Asshur carries you away captive?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then he took up his oracle and said:<br/>  “Alas! Who shall live when God does this?<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_24">   <sup>24</sup>But ships <i>shall</i> <i>come</i> from the coasts of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 10:4; Ezek. 27:6; Dan. 11:30">⚓</a>Cyprus,<br/>   And they shall afflict Asshur and afflict <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 10:21, 25">⚓</a>Eber,<br/>   And so shall <i>Amalek,</i> until he perishes.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_24_25"> <sup>25</sup>So Balaam rose and departed and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:5; 31:8">⚓</a>returned to his place; Balak also went his way.<br/></span>
