<div class="title"><h1>27</h1><h3>Inheritance Laws</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_27_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then came the daughters of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:33; 36:1, 11; Josh. 17:3">⚓</a>Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these <i>were</i> the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_2"><sup>2</sup>And they stood before Moses, before Eleazar the priest, and before the leaders and all the congregation, <i>by</i> the doorway of the tabernacle of meeting, saying: </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_3"><sup>3</sup>“Our father <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:35; 26:64, 65">⚓</a>died in the wilderness; but he was not in the company of those who gathered together against the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:1, 2">⚓</a>in company with Korah, but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons. </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_4"><sup>4</sup>Why should the name of our father be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 25:6">⚓</a>removed from among his family because he had no son? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 17:4">⚓</a>Give us a possession among our father’s brothers.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_27_5"> <sup>5</sup>So Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:13–26">⚓</a>brought their case before the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_27_6"> <sup>6</sup>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_7"><sup>7</sup>“The daughters of Zelophehad speak <i>what</i> <i>is</i> right; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 36:2; Josh. 17:4">⚓</a>you shall surely give them a possession of inheritance among their father’s brothers, and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them. </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_8"><sup>8</sup>And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘If a man dies and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter. </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_9"><sup>9</sup>If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers. </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_10"><sup>10</sup>If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers. </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_11"><sup>11</sup>And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to the relative closest to him in his family, and he shall possess it.’ ” And it shall be to the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:29">⚓</a>a statute of judgment, just as the Lord commanded Moses.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Joshua the Next Leader of Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_27_12"> <sup>12</sup>Now the Lord said to Moses: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:47; Deut. 3:23–27; 32:48–52; 34:1–4">⚓</a>“Go up into this Mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_13"><sup>13</sup>And when you have seen it, you also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:12, 24, 28; 31:2; Deut. 10:6; 34:5, 6">⚓</a>shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered. </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_14"><sup>14</sup>For in the Wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:12, 24; Deut. 1:37; 32:51; Ps. 106:32, 33">⚓</a>rebelled against My command to hallow Me at the waters before their eyes.” (These <i>are</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:7">⚓</a>waters of Meribah, at Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin.)<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_27_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then Moses spoke to the Lord, saying: </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_16"><sup>16</sup>“Let the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:22; Heb. 12:9">⚓</a>the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:2; 1 Sam. 8:20; 18:13; 2 Chr. 1:10">⚓</a>who may go out before them and go in before them, who may lead them out and bring them in, that the congregation of the Lord may not be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:17; Zech. 10:2; Matt. 9:36; Mark 6:34">⚓</a>like sheep which have no shepherd.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_27_18"> <sup>18</sup>And the Lord said to Moses: “Take Joshua the son of Nun with you, a man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:38; Judg. 3:10; 1 Sam. 16:13, 18">⚓</a>in whom <i>is</i> the Spirit, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 34:9">⚓</a>lay your hand on him; </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_19"><sup>19</sup>set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:28; 31:3, 7, 8, 23">⚓</a>inaugurate him in their sight. </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_20"><sup>20</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:17">⚓</a>you shall give <i>some</i> of your authority to him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:16–18">⚓</a>may be obedient. </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:18, 23, 26; 1 Sam. 23:9; 30:7">⚓</a>He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire before the Lord for him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 28:30; 1 Sam. 28:6">⚓</a>by the judgment of the Urim. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:14; 1 Sam. 22:10">⚓</a>At his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, he and all the children of Israel with him—all the congregation.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_27_22"> <sup>22</sup>So Moses did as the Lord commanded him. He took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation. </span>
<span class="verse dan_27_23"><sup>23</sup>And he laid his hands on him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:28; 31:7, 8">⚓</a>and inaugurated him, just as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses.<br/></span>
