<div class="title"><h1>31</h1><h3>Vengeance on the Midianites</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_31_1"> <sup>1</sup>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 25:17">⚓</a>“Take vengeance on the Midianites for the children of Israel. Afterward you shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:12, 13">⚓</a>be gathered to your people.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_31_3"> <sup>3</sup>So Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm some of yourselves for war, and let them go against the Midianites to take vengeance for the Lord on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 13:21">⚓</a>Midian. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_4"><sup>4</sup>A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_31_5"> <sup>5</sup>So there were recruited from the divisions of Israel one thousand from <i>each</i> tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_6"><sup>6</sup>Then Moses sent them to the war, one thousand from <i>each</i> tribe; he sent them to the war with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the holy articles and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 10:9">⚓</a>the signal trumpets in his hand. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_7"><sup>7</sup>And they warred against the Midianites, just as the Lord commanded Moses, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:13; Judg. 21:11; 1 Sam. 27:9; 1 Kin. 11:15, 16">⚓</a>they killed all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:25">⚓</a>males. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_8"><sup>8</sup>They killed the kings of Midian with <i>the</i> <i>rest</i> <i>of</i> those who were killed—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 13:21">⚓</a>Evi, Rekem, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 25:15">⚓</a>Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 31:16; Josh. 13:22">⚓</a>Balaam the son of Beor they also killed with the sword.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_31_9"> <sup>9</sup>And the children of Israel took the women of Midian captive, with their little ones, and took as spoil all their cattle, all their flocks, and all their goods. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_10"><sup>10</sup>They also burned with fire all the cities where they dwelt, and all their forts. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_11"><sup>11</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:14">⚓</a>they took all the spoil and all the booty—of man and beast.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Return from the War</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_31_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then they brought the captives, the booty, and the spoil to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, <i>across</i> <i>from</i> Jericho. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_13"><sup>13</sup>And Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation, went to meet them outside the camp. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_14"><sup>14</sup>But Moses was angry with the officers of the army, <i>with</i> the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds, who had come from the battle.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_31_15"> <sup>15</sup>And Moses said to them: “Have you kept <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:14">⚓</a>all the women alive? </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_16"><sup>16</sup>Look, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 25:2">⚓</a>these <i>women</i> caused the children of Israel, through the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 24:14; 2 Pet. 2:15; Rev. 2:14">⚓</a>counsel of Balaam, to trespass against the Lord in the incident of Peor, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 25:9">⚓</a>there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_17"><sup>17</sup>Now therefore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:2; 20:16–18; Judg. 21:11">⚓</a>kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man intimately. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_18"><sup>18</sup>But keep alive <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 21:10–14">⚓</a>for yourselves all the young girls who have not known a man intimately. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_19"><sup>19</sup>And as for you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 5:2">⚓</a>remain outside the camp seven days; whoever has killed any person, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 19:11–22">⚓</a>whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_20"><sup>20</sup>Purify every garment, everything made of leather, everything woven of goats’ <i>hair,</i> and everything made of wood.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_31_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to the battle, “This <i>is</i> the ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses: </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_22"><sup>22</sup>Only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead, </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_23"><sup>23</sup>everything that can endure fire, you shall put through the fire, and it shall be clean; and it shall be purified <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 19:9, 17">⚓</a>with the water of purification. But all that cannot endure fire you shall put through water. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:25">⚓</a>And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you may come into the camp.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Division of the Plunder</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_31_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_26"><sup>26</sup>“Count up the plunder that was taken—of man and beast—you and Eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregation; </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_27"><sup>27</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 22:8; 1 Sam. 30:24">⚓</a>divide the plunder into two parts, between those who took part in the war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_28"><sup>28</sup>And levy a tribute for the Lord on the men of war who went out to battle: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 31:30, 47">⚓</a>one of every five hundred of the persons, the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep; </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_29"><sup>29</sup>take <i>it</i> from their half, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 18:1–5">⚓</a>give <i>it</i> to Eleazar the priest as a heave offering to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_30"><sup>30</sup>And from the children of Israel’s half you shall take <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 31:42–47">⚓</a>one of every fifty, drawn from the persons, the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep, from all the livestock, and give them to the Levites <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 3:7, 8, 25, 31, 36; 18:3, 4">⚓</a>who keep charge of the tabernacle of the Lord.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_31"><sup>31</sup>So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_31_32"> <sup>32</sup>The booty remaining from the plunder, which the men of war had taken, was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep, </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_33"><sup>33</sup>seventy-two thousand cattle, </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_34"><sup>34</sup>sixty-one thousand donkeys, </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_35"><sup>35</sup>and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of women who had not known a man intimately. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_36"><sup>36</sup>And the half, the portion for those who had gone out to war, was in number three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep; </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_37"><sup>37</sup>and the Lord’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_38"><sup>38</sup>The cattle <i>were</i> thirty-six thousand, of which the Lord’s tribute <i>was</i> seventy-two. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_39"><sup>39</sup>The donkeys <i>were</i> thirty thousand five hundred, of which the Lord’s tribute <i>was</i> sixty-one. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_40"><sup>40</sup>The persons <i>were</i> sixteen thousand, of which the Lord’s tribute <i>was</i> thirty-two persons. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_41"><sup>41</sup>So Moses gave the tribute <i>which</i> <i>was</i> the Lord’s heave offering to Eleazar the priest, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 5:9, 10; 18:8, 19">⚓</a>as the Lord commanded Moses.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_31_42"> <sup>42</sup>And from the children of Israel’s half, which Moses separated from the men who fought— </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_43"><sup>43</sup>now the half belonging to the congregation was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep, </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_44"><sup>44</sup>thirty-six thousand cattle, </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_45"><sup>45</sup>thirty thousand five hundred donkeys, </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_46"><sup>46</sup>and sixteen thousand persons— </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_47"><sup>47</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 31:30">⚓</a>from the children of Israel’s half Moses took one of every fifty, drawn from man and beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept charge of the tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_31_48"> <sup>48</sup>Then the officers who <i>were</i> over thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses; </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_49"><sup>49</sup>and they said to Moses, “Your servants have taken a count of the men of war who <i>are</i> under our command, and not a man of us is missing. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_50"><sup>50</sup>Therefore we have brought an offering for the Lord, what every man found of ornaments of gold: armlets and bracelets and signet rings and earrings and necklaces, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:12–16">⚓</a>to make atonement for ourselves before the Lord.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_51"><sup>51</sup>So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from them, all the fashioned ornaments. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_52"><sup>52</sup>And all the gold of the offering that they offered to the Lord, from the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_53"><sup>53</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 31:32; Deut. 20:14">⚓</a>(The men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.) </span>
<span class="verse dan_31_54"><sup>54</sup>And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of meeting <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:16">⚓</a>as a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord.<br/></span>
