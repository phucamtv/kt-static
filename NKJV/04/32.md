<div class="title"><h1>32</h1><h3>The Tribes Settling East of the Jordan</h3></div>
<span class="verse dan_32_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock; and when they saw the land of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:32; Josh. 13:25; 2 Sam. 24:5">⚓</a>Jazer and the land of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:13">⚓</a>Gilead, that indeed the region <i>was</i> a place for livestock, </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_2"><sup>2</sup>the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the congregation, saying, </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_3"><sup>3</sup>“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:36">⚓</a>Nimrah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 13:17, 26">⚓</a>Heshbon, Elealeh, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:38">⚓</a>Shebam, Nebo, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:38">⚓</a>Beon, </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_4"><sup>4</sup>the country <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:24, 34, 35">⚓</a>which the Lord defeated before the congregation of Israel, <i>is</i> a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.” </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_5"><sup>5</sup>Therefore they said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not take us over the Jordan.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_32_6"> <sup>6</sup>And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben: “Shall your brethren go to war while you sit here? </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_7"><sup>7</sup>Now why will you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:27—14:4">⚓</a>discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the Lord has given them? </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_8"><sup>8</sup>Thus your fathers did <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:3, 26">⚓</a>when I sent them away from Kadesh Barnea <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:19–25">⚓</a>to see the land. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_9"><sup>9</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:24, 31; Deut. 1:24, 28">⚓</a>when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, so that they did not go into the land which the Lord had given them. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:11; Deut. 1:34–36">⚓</a>So the Lord’s anger was aroused on that day, and He swore an oath, saying, </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_11"><sup>11</sup>‘Surely none of the men who came up from Egypt, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:28, 29; 26:63–65; Deut. 1:35">⚓</a>from twenty years old and above, shall see the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:24, 30">⚓</a>they have not wholly followed Me, </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_12"><sup>12</sup>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:6–9, 24, 30; Deut. 1:36; Josh. 14:8, 9">⚓</a>for they have wholly followed the Lord.’ </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_13"><sup>13</sup>So the Lord’s anger was aroused against Israel, and He made them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:33–35">⚓</a>wander in the wilderness forty years, until <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:64, 65">⚓</a>all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord was gone. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_14"><sup>14</sup>And look! You have risen in your fathers’ place, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:1; Deut. 1:34">⚓</a>fierce anger of the Lord against Israel. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_15"><sup>15</sup>For if you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 30:17, 18; Josh. 22:16–18; 2 Chr. 7:19; 15:2">⚓</a>turn away from following Him, He will once again leave them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all these people.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_32_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then they came near to him and said: “We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones, </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_17"><sup>17</sup>but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 4:12, 13">⚓</a>we ourselves will be armed, ready <i>to</i> <i>go</i> before the children of Israel until we have brought them to their place; and our little ones will dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 22:1–4">⚓</a>We will not return to our homes until every one of the children of Israel has received his inheritance. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_19"><sup>19</sup>For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 12:1; 13:8">⚓</a>because our inheritance has fallen to us on this eastern side of the Jordan.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_32_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:18; Josh. 1:14">⚓</a>Moses said to them: “If you do this thing, if you arm yourselves before the Lord for the war, </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_21"><sup>21</sup>and all your armed men cross over the Jordan before the Lord until He has driven out His enemies from before Him, </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_22"><sup>22</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:20; Josh. 11:23">⚓</a>the land is subdued before the Lord, then afterward <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 22:4">⚓</a>you may return and be blameless before the Lord and before Israel; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:12, 15, 16, 18; Josh. 1:15; 13:8, 32; 22:4, 9">⚓</a>this land shall be your possession before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_23"><sup>23</sup>But if you do not do so, then take note, you have sinned against the Lord; and be sure <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:7; 44:16; Josh. 7:1–26; Is. 59:12; (Gal. 6:7)">⚓</a>your sin will find you out. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:16">⚓</a>Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what has proceeded out of your mouth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_32_25"> <sup>25</sup>And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying: “Your servants will do as my lord commands. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_26"><sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:14">⚓</a>Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock will be there in the cities of Gilead; </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 4:12">⚓</a>but your servants will cross over, every man armed for war, before the Lord to battle, just as my lord says.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_32_28"> <sup>28</sup>So Moses gave command <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:13">⚓</a>concerning them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_29"><sup>29</sup>And Moses said to them: “If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, every man armed for battle before the Lord, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead as a possession. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_30"><sup>30</sup>But if they do not cross over armed with you, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_32_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying: “As the Lord has said to your servants, so we will do. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_32"><sup>32</sup>We will cross over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan, but the possession of our inheritance <i>shall</i> <i>remain</i> with us on this side of the Jordan.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_32_33"> <sup>33</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:8–17; 29:8; Josh. 12:1–6; 13:8–31; 22:4">⚓</a>Moses gave to the children of Gad, to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:24, 33, 35">⚓</a>the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land with its cities within the borders, the cities of the surrounding country. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_34"><sup>34</sup>And the children of Gad built <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:45, 46">⚓</a>Dibon and Ataroth and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:36">⚓</a>Aroer, </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_35"><sup>35</sup>Atroth and Shophan and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:1, 3">⚓</a>Jazer and Jogbehah, </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_36"><sup>36</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:3">⚓</a>Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:24">⚓</a>fortified cities, and folds for sheep. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_37"><sup>37</sup>And the children of Reuben built <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:27">⚓</a>Heshbon and Elealeh and Kirjathaim, </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_38"><sup>38</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 46:1">⚓</a>Nebo and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 25:9">⚓</a>Baal Meon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:13; Josh. 23:7">⚓</a>(<i>their</i> names being changed) and Shibmah; and they gave <i>other</i> names to the cities which they built.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_32_39"> <sup>39</sup>And the children of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:23; Num. 27:1; 36:1">⚓</a>Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who <i>were</i> in it. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_40"><sup>40</sup>So Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:12, 13, 15; Josh. 13:31">⚓</a>gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he dwelt in it. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_41"><sup>41</sup>Also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:14; Josh. 13:30">⚓</a>Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its small towns, and called them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:4; 1 Kin. 4:13">⚓</a>Havoth Jair. </span>
<span class="verse dan_32_42"><sup>42</sup>Then Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages, and he called it Nobah, after his own name.<br/></span>
