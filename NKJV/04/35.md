<span class="verse dan_35_1"> <sup>1</sup>And the Lord spoke to Moses in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:50">⚓</a>the plains of Moab by the Jordan <i>across</i> <i>from</i> Jericho, saying: </span>
<span class="verse dan_35_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 14:3, 4; 21:2, 3; Ezek. 45:1; 48:10–20">⚓</a>“Command the children of Israel that they give the Levites cities to dwell in from the inheritance of their possession, and you shall <i>also</i> give the Levites <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 25:32–34">⚓</a>common-land around the cities. </span>
<span class="verse dan_35_3"><sup>3</sup>They shall have the cities to dwell in; and their common-land shall be for their cattle, for their herds, and for all their animals. </span>
<span class="verse dan_35_4"><sup>4</sup>The common-land of the cities which you will give the Levites <i>shall</i> <i>extend</i> from the wall of the city outward a thousand cubits all around. </span>
<span class="verse dan_35_5"><sup>5</sup>And you shall measure outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, on the south side two thousand cubits, on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits. The city <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> in the middle. This shall belong to them as common-land for the cities.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_35_6"> <sup>6</sup>“Now among the cities which you will give to the Levites <i>you</i> <i>shall</i> <i>appoint</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:41; Josh. 20:2, 7, 8; 21:3, 13">⚓</a>six cities of refuge, to which a manslayer may flee. And to these you shall add forty-two cities. </span>
<span class="verse dan_35_7"><sup>7</sup>So all the cities you will give to the Levites <i>shall</i> <i>be</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 21:41">⚓</a>forty-eight; these <i>you</i> <i>shall</i> <i>give</i> with their common-land. </span>
<span class="verse dan_35_8"><sup>8</sup>And the cities which you will give <i>shall</i> <i>be</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 21:3">⚓</a>from the possession of the children of Israel; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:54; 33:54">⚓</a>from the larger <i>tribe</i> you shall give many, from the smaller you shall give few. Each shall give some of its cities to the Levites, in proportion to the inheritance that each receives.”<br/></span>

<span class="verse dan_35_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, </span>
<span class="verse dan_35_10"><sup>10</sup>“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 19:2; Josh. 20:1–9">⚓</a>‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, </span>
<span class="verse dan_35_11"><sup>11</sup>then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 21:13; Num. 35:22–25; Deut. 19:1–13">⚓</a>you shall appoint cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the manslayer who kills any person accidentally may flee there. </span>

<span class="verse dan_35_13"><sup>13</sup>And of the cities which you give, you shall have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:6">⚓</a>six cities of refuge. </span>
<span class="verse dan_35_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:41; Josh. 20:8">⚓</a>You shall appoint three cities on this side of the Jordan, and three cities you shall appoint in the land of Canaan, <i>which</i> will be cities of refuge. </span>
<span class="verse dan_35_15"><sup>15</sup>These six cities shall be for refuge for the children of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 15:16">⚓</a>for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them, that anyone who kills a person accidentally may flee there.<br/></span>

<span class="verse dan_35_18"><sup>18</sup>Or <i>if</i> he strikes him with a wooden hand weapon, by which one could die, and he does die, he <i>is</i> a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. </span>

<span class="verse dan_35_21"><sup>21</sup>or in enmity he strikes him with his hand so that he dies, the one who struck <i>him</i> shall surely be put to death. He <i>is</i> a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_35_22"> <sup>22</sup>‘However, if he pushes him suddenly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 21:13">⚓</a>without enmity, or throws anything at him without lying in wait, </span>

<span class="verse dan_35_25"><sup>25</sup>So the congregation shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall return him to the city of refuge where he had fled, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 20:6">⚓</a>he shall remain there until the death of the high priest <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:7; Lev. 4:3; 21:10">⚓</a>who was anointed with the holy oil. </span>
<span class="verse dan_35_26"><sup>26</sup>But if the manslayer at any time goes outside the limits of the city of refuge where he fled, </span>

<span class="verse dan_35_28"><sup>28</sup>because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest the manslayer may return to the land of his possession.<br/></span>
<span class="verse dan_35_29"> <sup>29</sup>‘And these <i>things</i> shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:11">⚓</a>a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. </span>
