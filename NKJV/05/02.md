<span class="verse phu_2_2"> <sup>2</sup>“And the Lord spoke to me, saying: </span>
<span class="verse phu_2_3"><sup>3</sup>‘You have skirted this mountain <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:7, 14">⚓</a>long enough; turn northward. </span>

<span class="verse phu_2_9"><sup>9</sup>Then the Lord said to me, ‘Do not harass Moab, nor contend with them in battle, for I will not give you <i>any</i> of their land <i>as</i> a possession, because I have given <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:15, 28; Deut. 2:18, 29">⚓</a>Ar to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:36–38">⚓</a>the descendants of Lot <i>as</i> a possession.’ ”<br/></span>
