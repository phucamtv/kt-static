<span class="verse phu_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>“When the Lord your God brings you into the land which you go to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:10">⚓</a>possess, and has cast out many <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:19–21">⚓</a>nations before you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:2">⚓</a>the Hittites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you, </span>
<span class="verse phu_7_2"><sup>2</sup>and when the Lord your God delivers <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 31:17; Deut. 20:16–18">⚓</a>them over to you, you shall conquer them <i>and</i> utterly destroy them. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:32, 33; Josh. 2:14">⚓</a>You shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy to them. </span>

<span class="verse phu_7_4"><sup>4</sup>For they will turn your sons away from following Me, to serve other gods; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:15">⚓</a>so the anger of the Lord will be aroused against you and destroy you suddenly. </span>
<span class="verse phu_7_5"><sup>5</sup>But thus you shall deal with them: you shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:24; 34:13; Deut. 12:3">⚓</a>destroy their altars, and break down their <i>sacred</i> pillars, and cut down their wooden images, and burn their carved images with fire.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_7_6"> <sup>6</sup>“For you <i>are</i> a holy people to the Lord your God; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:5, 6; Amos 3:2; 1 Pet. 2:9">⚓</a>the Lord your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure above all the peoples on the face of the earth. </span>
<span class="verse phu_7_7"><sup>7</sup>The Lord did not set His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:37">⚓</a>love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people, for you were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 10:22">⚓</a>the least of all peoples; </span>
<span class="verse phu_7_8"><sup>8</sup>but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 10:15">⚓</a>because the Lord loves you, and because He would keep <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:55, 72, 73">⚓</a>the oath which He swore to your fathers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:3, 14">⚓</a>the Lord has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.<br/></span>

<span class="verse phu_7_11"><sup>11</sup>Therefore you shall keep the commandment, the statutes, and the judgments which I command you today, to observe them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Blessings of Obedience</h3></div>
<span class="verse phu_7_12"> <sup>12</sup>“Then it shall come to pass, because you listen to these judgments, and keep and do them, that the Lord your God will keep with you the covenant and the mercy which He swore to your fathers. </span>
<span class="verse phu_7_13"><sup>13</sup>And He will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 146:8; Prov. 15:9; John 14:21">⚓</a>love you and bless you and multiply you; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:4">⚓</a>He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your cattle and the offspring of your flock, in the land of which He swore to your fathers to give you. </span>

<span class="verse phu_7_15"><sup>15</sup>And the Lord will take away from you all sickness, and will afflict you with none of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:14; 15:26; Deut. 28:27, 60">⚓</a>terrible diseases of Egypt which you have known, but will lay <i>them</i> on all those who hate you. </span>
<span class="verse phu_7_16"><sup>16</sup>Also you shall destroy all the peoples whom the Lord your God delivers over to you; your eye shall have no pity on them; nor shall you serve their gods, for that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:33; Judg. 8:27; Ps. 106:36">⚓</a><i>will</i> <i>be</i> a snare to you.<br/></span>

<span class="verse phu_7_18"><sup>18</sup>you shall not be afraid of them, <i>but</i> you shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:5">⚓</a>remember well what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt: </span>
<span class="verse phu_7_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:34; 29:3">⚓</a>the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs and the wonders, the mighty hand and the outstretched arm, by which the Lord your God brought you out.

<span class="verse phu_7_21"><sup>21</sup>You shall not be terrified of them; for the Lord your God, the great and awesome God, <i>is</i> among you. </span>
<span class="verse phu_7_22"><sup>22</sup>And the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:29, 30">⚓</a>little by little; you will be unable to destroy them at once, lest the beasts of the field become <i>too</i> numerous for you. </span>
<span class="verse phu_7_23"><sup>23</sup>But the Lord your God will deliver them over to you, and will inflict defeat upon them until they are destroyed. </span>
<span class="verse phu_7_24"><sup>24</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:24, 42; 12:1–24">⚓</a>He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you will destroy their name from under heaven; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 23:9">⚓</a>no one shall be able to stand against you until you have destroyed them. </span>
<span class="verse phu_7_25"><sup>25</sup>You shall burn the carved images of their gods with fire; you shall not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 23:6">⚓</a>covet the silver or gold <i>that</i> <i>is</i> on them, nor take <i>it</i> for yourselves, lest you be snared by it; for it <i>is</i> an abomination to the Lord your God. </span>
<span class="verse phu_7_26"><sup>26</sup>Nor shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be doomed to destruction like it. You shall utterly detest it and utterly abhor it, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:17">⚓</a>for it <i>is</i> an accursed thing.<br/></span>
