<span class="verse phu_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>“Hear, O Israel: You <i>are</i> to cross over the Jordan today, and go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to heaven, </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_2"><sup>2</sup>a people great and tall, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:22, 28, 33; Josh. 11:21, 22">⚓</a>descendants of the Anakim, whom you know, and <i>of</i> <i>whom</i> you heard <i>it</i> <i>said,</i> ‘Who can stand before the descendants of Anak?’ </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_3"><sup>3</sup>Therefore understand today that the Lord your God <i>is</i> He who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:33; 31:3; Josh. 3:11; 5:14; John 10:4">⚓</a>goes over before you <i>as</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:24; Heb. 12:29">⚓</a>consuming fire. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:24">⚓</a>He will destroy them and bring them down before you; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:31">⚓</a>so you shall drive them out and destroy them quickly, as the Lord has said to you.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_9_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:17; (Rom. 11:6, 20; 1 Cor. 4:4, 7)">⚓</a>“Do not think in your heart, after the Lord your God has cast them out before you, saying, ‘Because of my righteousness the Lord has brought me in to possess this land’; but <i>it</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:16; Lev. 18:3, 24–30; Deut. 12:31; 18:9–14">⚓</a>because of the wickedness of these nations <i>that</i> the Lord is driving them out from before you. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Titus 3:5)">⚓</a><i>It</i> <i>is</i> not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart <i>that</i> you go in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations <i>that</i> the Lord your God drives them out from before you, and that He may fulfill the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:24">⚓</a>word which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_6"><sup>6</sup>Therefore understand that the Lord your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you <i>are</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:9; Deut. 31:27">⚓</a>stiff-necked people.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_9_7"> <sup>7</sup>“Remember! Do not forget how you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:22">⚓</a>provoked the Lord your God to wrath in the wilderness. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:11">⚓</a>From the day that you departed from the land of Egypt until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_8"><sup>8</sup>Also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:1–8; Ps. 106:19">⚓</a>in Horeb you provoked the Lord to wrath, so that the Lord was angry <i>enough</i> with you to have destroyed you. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:12, 15; Deut. 5:2–22">⚓</a>When I went up into the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which the Lord made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:18">⚓</a>forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 31:18; Deut. 4:13">⚓</a>Then the Lord delivered to me two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them <i>were</i> all the words which the Lord had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:17">⚓</a>in the day of the assembly. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_11"><sup>11</sup>And it came to pass, at the end of forty days and forty nights, <i>that</i> the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_9_12"> <sup>12</sup>“Then the Lord said to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:7, 8">⚓</a>‘Arise, go down quickly from here, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted corruptly; they have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:29">⚓</a>quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made themselves a molded image.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_9_13"> <sup>13</sup>“Furthermore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:9">⚓</a>the Lord spoke to me, saying, ‘I have seen this people, and indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:6">⚓</a>they are a stiff-necked people. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:10">⚓</a>Let Me alone, that I may destroy them and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:20">⚓</a>blot out their name from under heaven; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:12">⚓</a>and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_9_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:15–19">⚓</a>“So I turned and came down from the mountain, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:18">⚓</a>the mountain burned with fire; and the two tablets of the covenant <i>were</i> in my two hands. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_16"><sup>16</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:19">⚓</a>I looked, and behold, you had sinned against the Lord your God—had made for yourselves a molded calf! You had turned aside quickly from the way which the Lord had commanded you. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_17"><sup>17</sup>Then I took the two tablets and threw them out of my two hands and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:19">⚓</a>broke them before your eyes. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_18"><sup>18</sup>And I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:28; Ps. 106:23">⚓</a>fell down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you committed in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:10, 11; Heb. 12:21">⚓</a>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the Lord was angry with you, to destroy you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:14">⚓</a>But the Lord listened to me at that time also. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_20"><sup>20</sup>And the Lord was very angry with Aaron <i>and</i> would have destroyed him; so I prayed for Aaron also at the same time. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_21"><sup>21</sup>Then I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire and crushed it <i>and</i> ground <i>it</i> very small, until it was as fine as dust; and I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:20">⚓</a>threw its dust into the brook that descended from the mountain.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_9_22"> <sup>22</sup>“Also at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:1, 3">⚓</a>Taberah and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:7">⚓</a>Massah and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:4, 34">⚓</a>Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked the Lord to wrath. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_23"><sup>23</sup>Likewise, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:3">⚓</a>when the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, ‘Go up and possess the land which I have given you,’ then you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 106:24, 25">⚓</a>you did not believe Him nor obey His voice. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:7; 31:27">⚓</a>You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_9_25"> <sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:18">⚓</a>“Thus I prostrated myself before the Lord; forty days and forty nights I kept prostrating myself, because the Lord had said He would destroy you. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_26"><sup>26</sup>Therefore I prayed to the Lord, and said: ‘O Lord God, do not destroy Your people and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:9">⚓</a>Your inheritance whom You have redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_27"><sup>27</sup>Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look on the stubbornness of this people, or on their wickedness or their sin, </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_28"><sup>28</sup>lest the land from which You brought us should say, “Because the Lord was not able to bring them to the land which He promised them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.” </span>
<span class="verse phu_9_29"><sup>29</sup>Yet they <i>are</i> Your people and Your inheritance, whom You brought out by Your mighty power and by Your outstretched arm.’<br/></span>
