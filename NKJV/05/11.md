<span class="verse phu_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>“Therefore you shall love the Lord your God, and keep His charge, His statutes, His judgments, and His commandments always. </span>
<span class="verse phu_11_2"><sup>2</sup>Know today that <i>I</i> <i>do</i> not <i>speak</i> with your children, who have not known and who have not seen the chastening of the Lord your God, His greatness and His mighty hand and His outstretched arm— </span>
<span class="verse phu_11_3"><sup>3</sup>His signs and His acts which He did in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to all his land; </span>
<span class="verse phu_11_4"><sup>4</sup>what He did to the army of Egypt, to their horses and their chariots: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:28; Ps. 106:11">⚓</a>how He made the waters of the Red Sea overflow them as they pursued you, and <i>how</i> the Lord has destroyed them to this day; </span>
<span class="verse phu_11_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:1–35; Ps. 106:16–18">⚓</a>what He did for you in the wilderness until you came to this place; </span>
<span class="verse phu_11_6"><sup>6</sup>and what He did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, their households, their tents, and all the substance that <i>was</i> in their possession, in the midst of all Israel— </span>
<span class="verse phu_11_7"><sup>7</sup>but your eyes have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 10:21; 29:2">⚓</a>seen every great act of the Lord which He did.<br/></span>

<span class="verse phu_11_10"><sup>10</sup>For the land which you go to possess <i>is</i> not like the land of Egypt from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and watered <i>it</i> by foot, as a vegetable garden; </span>
<span class="verse phu_11_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:7">⚓</a>but the land which you cross over to possess <i>is</i> a land of hills and valleys, which drinks water from the rain of heaven, </span>
<span class="verse phu_11_12"><sup>12</sup>a land for which the Lord your God cares; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:3">⚓</a>the eyes of the Lord your God <i>are</i> always on it, from the beginning of the year to the very end of the year.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_11_13"> <sup>13</sup>‘And it shall be that if you earnestly obey My commandments which I command you today, to love the Lord your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul, </span>
<span class="verse phu_11_14"><sup>14</sup>then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:4; Deut. 28:12">⚓</a>I will give <i>you</i> the rain for your land in its season, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Joel 2:23; James 5:7">⚓</a>the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil. </span>
<span class="verse phu_11_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 104:14">⚓</a>And I will send grass in your fields for your livestock, that you may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:11; Joel 2:19">⚓</a>eat and be filled.’ </span>
<span class="verse phu_11_16"><sup>16</sup>“Take heed to yourselves, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:18; Job 31:27">⚓</a>lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:19">⚓</a>serve other gods and worship them, </span>
