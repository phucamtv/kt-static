<span class="verse phu_13_3"><sup>3</sup>you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams, for the Lord your God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:20; Deut. 8:2, 16">⚓</a>is testing you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. </span>
