<span class="verse phu_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>“When the Lord your God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:29">⚓</a>has cut off the nations whose land the Lord your God is giving you, and you dispossess them and dwell in their cities and in their houses, </span>
<span class="verse phu_19_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 21:13; Num. 35:10–15; Deut. 4:41; Josh. 20:2">⚓</a>you shall separate three cities for yourself in the midst of your land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess. </span>
<span class="verse phu_19_3"><sup>3</sup>You shall prepare roads for yourself, and divide into three parts the territory of your land which the Lord your God is giving you to inherit, that any manslayer may flee there.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_19_4"> <sup>4</sup>“And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:9–34; Deut. 4:42">⚓</a>this <i>is</i> the case of the manslayer who flees there, that he may live: Whoever kills his neighbor unintentionally, not having hated him in time past— </span>
<span class="verse phu_19_5"><sup>5</sup>as when <i>a</i> <i>man</i> goes to the woods with his neighbor to cut timber, and his hand swings a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies—he shall flee to one of these cities and live; </span>
<span class="verse phu_19_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:12">⚓</a>lest the avenger of blood, while his anger is hot, pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and kill him, though he <i>was</i> not deserving of death, since he had not hated the victim in time past. </span>
<span class="verse phu_19_7"><sup>7</sup>Therefore I command you, saying, ‘You shall separate three cities for yourself.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_19_8"> <sup>8</sup>“Now if the Lord your God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:20">⚓</a>enlarges your territory, as He swore to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:18–21">⚓</a>your fathers, and gives you the land which He promised to give to your fathers, </span>
<span class="verse phu_19_9"><sup>9</sup>and if you keep all these commandments and do them, which I command you today, to love the Lord your God and to walk always in His ways, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 20:7–9">⚓</a>then you shall add three more cities for yourself besides these three, </span>
<span class="verse phu_19_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:33; Deut. 21:1–9">⚓</a>lest innocent blood be shed in the midst of your land which the Lord your God is giving you <i>as</i> an inheritance, and <i>thus</i> guilt of bloodshed be upon you.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_19_11"> <sup>11</sup>“But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:16, 24; Deut. 27:24; (1 John 3:15)">⚓</a>if anyone hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him, rises against him and strikes him mortally, so that he dies, and he flees to one of these cities, </span>
<span class="verse phu_19_12"><sup>12</sup>then the elders of his city shall send and bring him from there, and deliver him over to the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. </span>
<span class="verse phu_19_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:8">⚓</a>Your eye shall not pity him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:33, 34; 1 Kin. 2:31">⚓</a>but you shall put away <i>the</i> <i>guilt</i> <i>of</i> innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.<br/></span>

<span class="verse phu_19_16"><sup>16</sup>If a false witness <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:1; Ps. 27:12; 35:11">⚓</a>rises against any man to testify against him of wrongdoing, </span>
