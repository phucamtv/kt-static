<span class="verse phu_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>“When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 20:7; Is. 31:1">⚓</a>horses and chariots <i>and</i> people more numerous than you, do not be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:18">⚓</a>afraid of them; for the Lord your God <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:21; Deut. 5:6; 31:6, 8; 2 Chr. 13:12; 32:7, 8; Ps. 23:4; Is. 41:10">⚓</a>with you, who brought you up from the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse phu_20_2"><sup>2</sup>So it shall be, when you are on the verge of battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people. </span>
<span class="verse phu_20_3"><sup>3</sup>And he shall say to them, ‘Hear, O Israel: Today you are on the verge of battle with your enemies. Do not let your heart faint, do not be afraid, and do not tremble or be terrified because of them; </span>
<span class="verse phu_20_4"><sup>4</sup>for the Lord your God <i>is</i> He who goes with you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:30; 3:22; Josh. 23:10">⚓</a>to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_20_5"> <sup>5</sup>“Then the officers shall speak to the people, saying: ‘What man <i>is</i> <i>there</i> who has built a new house and has not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 12:27">⚓</a>dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it. </span>
<span class="verse phu_20_6"><sup>6</sup>Also what man <i>is</i> <i>there</i> who has planted a vineyard and has not eaten of it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man eat of it. </span>
<span class="verse phu_20_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 24:5">⚓</a>And what man <i>is</i> <i>there</i> who is betrothed to a woman and has not married her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle and another man marry her.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_20_8"> <sup>8</sup>“The officers shall speak further to the people, and say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:3">⚓</a>‘What man <i>is</i> <i>there</i> <i>who</i> <i>is</i> fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house, lest the heart of his brethren faint like his heart.’ </span>
<span class="verse phu_20_9"><sup>9</sup>And so it shall be, when the officers have finished speaking to the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_20_10"> <sup>10</sup>“When you go near a city to fight against it, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 10:19">⚓</a>then proclaim an offer of peace to it. </span>
<span class="verse phu_20_11"><sup>11</sup>And it shall be that if they accept your offer of peace, and open to you, then all the people <i>who</i> <i>are</i> found in it shall be placed under tribute to you, and serve you. </span>
<span class="verse phu_20_12"><sup>12</sup>Now if <i>the</i> <i>city</i> will not make peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall besiege it. </span>
<span class="verse phu_20_13"><sup>13</sup>And when the Lord your God delivers it into your hands, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 31:7">⚓</a>you shall strike every male in it with the edge of the sword. </span>
<span class="verse phu_20_14"><sup>14</sup>But the women, the little ones, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 8:2">⚓</a>the livestock, and all that is in the city, all its spoil, you shall plunder for yourself; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:30">⚓</a>you shall eat the enemies’ plunder which the Lord your God gives you. </span>
<span class="verse phu_20_15"><sup>15</sup>Thus you shall do to all the cities <i>which</i> <i>are</i> very far from you, which <i>are</i> not of the cities of these nations.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_20_16"> <sup>16</sup>“But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:31–33; Num. 21:2, 3; Deut. 7:1–5; Josh. 11:14">⚓</a>of the cities of these peoples which the Lord your God gives you <i>as</i> an inheritance, you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive, </span>
<span class="verse phu_20_17"><sup>17</sup>but you shall utterly destroy them: the Hittite and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, just as the Lord your God has commanded you, </span>
<span class="verse phu_20_18"><sup>18</sup>lest <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:12–16; Deut. 7:4; 12:30; 18:9">⚓</a>they teach you to do according to all their abominations which they have done for their gods, and you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:33; 2 Kin. 21:3–15; Ps. 106:34–41">⚓</a>sin against the Lord your God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_20_19"> <sup>19</sup>“When you besiege a city for a long time, while making war against it to take it, you shall not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them; if you can eat of them, do not cut them down to use in the siege, for the tree of the field <i>is</i> man’s <i>food.</i></span>
<span class="verse phu_20_20"><sup>20</sup>Only the trees which you know <i>are</i> not trees for food you may destroy and cut down, to build siegeworks against the city that makes war with you, until it is subdued.<br/></span>
