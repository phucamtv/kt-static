<div class="title"><h1>29</h1><h3>The Covenant Renewed in Moab</h3></div>
<span class="verse phu_29_1"> <sup>1</sup>These <i>are</i> the words of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:46; Deut. 5:2, 3">⚓</a>covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He made with them in Horeb.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_29_2"> <sup>2</sup>Now Moses called all Israel and said to them: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:4; Deut. 11:7">⚓</a>“You have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land— </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:34; 7:19">⚓</a>the great trials which your eyes have seen, the signs, and those great wonders. </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_4"><sup>4</sup>Yet <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 6:9, 10; Ezek. 12:2); Matt. 13:14; (Acts 28:26, 27); Rom. 11:8; (Eph. 4:18)">⚓</a>the Lord has not given you a heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear, to this <i>very</i> day. </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:3; 8:2">⚓</a>And I have led you forty years in the wilderness. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:4">⚓</a>Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn out on your feet. </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:12; Deut. 8:3">⚓</a>You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or <i>similar</i> drink, that you may know that I <i>am</i> the Lord your God. </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_7"><sup>7</sup>And when you came to this place, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:23, 24; Deut. 2:26—3:3">⚓</a>Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us to battle, and we conquered them. </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_8"><sup>8</sup>We took their land and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:33; Deut. 3:12, 13">⚓</a>gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh. </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_9"><sup>9</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:6; 1 Kin. 2:3">⚓</a>keep the words of this covenant, and do them, that you may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:7">⚓</a>prosper in all that you do.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_29_10"> <sup>10</sup>“All of you stand today before the Lord your God: your leaders and your tribes and your elders and your officers, all the men of Israel, </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_11"><sup>11</sup>your little ones and your wives—also the stranger who <i>is</i> in your camp, from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:21, 23, 27">⚓</a>the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water— </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_12"><sup>12</sup>that you may enter into covenant with the Lord your God, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 10:29">⚓</a>into His oath, which the Lord your God makes with you today, </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_13"><sup>13</sup>that He may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:9">⚓</a>establish you today as a people for Himself, and <i>that</i> He may be God to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:7">⚓</a>just as He has spoken to you, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:7, 8">⚓</a>just as He has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_29_14"> <sup>14</sup>“I make this covenant and this oath, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 31:31; Heb. 8:7, 8)">⚓</a>not with you alone, </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_15"><sup>15</sup>but with <i>him</i> who stands here with us today before the Lord our God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:39">⚓</a>as well as with <i>him</i> who <i>is</i> not here with us today </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_16"><sup>16</sup>(for you know that we dwelt in the land of Egypt and that we came through the nations which you passed by, </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_17"><sup>17</sup>and you saw their abominations and their idols which <i>were</i> among them—wood and stone and silver and gold); </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_18"><sup>18</sup>so that there may not be among you man or woman or family or tribe, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 11:16">⚓</a>whose heart turns away today from the Lord our God, to go <i>and</i> serve the gods of these nations, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 12:15">⚓</a>and that there may not be among you a root bearing <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:32; Acts 8:23">⚓</a>bitterness or wormwood; </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_19"><sup>19</sup>and so it may not happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he blesses himself in his heart, saying, ‘I shall have peace, even though I follow the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 3:17; 7:24">⚓</a>dictates of my heart’—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 30:1">⚓</a>as though the drunkard could be included with the sober.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_29_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 14:7">⚓</a>“The Lord would not spare him; for then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 74:1">⚓</a>the anger of the Lord and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 79:5; Ezek. 23:25">⚓</a>His jealousy would burn against that man, and every curse that is written in this book would settle on him, and the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:33; Deut. 9:14; 2 Kin. 14:27">⚓</a>would blot out his name from under heaven. </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_21"><sup>21</sup>And the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 24:51)">⚓</a>would separate him from all the tribes of Israel for adversity, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 30:10">⚓</a>Law, </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_22"><sup>22</sup>so that the coming generation of your children who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a far land, would say, when they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 19:8; 49:17; 50:13">⚓</a>see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which the Lord has laid on it:<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_29_23"> <sup>23</sup>‘The whole land <i>is</i> brimstone, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 17:6; Zeph. 2:9">⚓</a>salt, and burning; it is not sown, nor does it bear, nor does any grass grow there, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:24, 25; Is. 1:9; Jer. 20:16; Hos. 11:8">⚓</a>like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which the Lord overthrew in His anger and His wrath.’ </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_24"><sup>24</sup>“All nations would say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:8; Jer. 22:8">⚓</a>‘Why has the Lord done so to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?’ </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_25"><sup>25</sup>Then <i>people</i> would say: ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt; </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_26"><sup>26</sup>for they went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods that they did not know and that He had not given to them. </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_27"><sup>27</sup>Then the anger of the Lord was aroused against this land, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:11">⚓</a>to bring on it every curse that is written in this book. </span>
<span class="verse phu_29_28"><sup>28</sup>And the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:15; 2 Chr. 7:20; Ps. 52:5; Prov. 2:22">⚓</a>uprooted them from their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as <i>it</i> <i>is</i> this day.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_29_29"> <sup>29</sup>“The secret <i>things</i> <i>belong</i> to the Lord our God, but those <i>things</i> <i>which</i> <i>are</i> revealed <i>belong</i> to us and to our children forever, that <i>we</i> may do all the words of this law.<br/></span>
