<div class="title"><h1>31</h1><h3>Joshua the New Leader of Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse phu_31_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_2"><sup>2</sup>And he said to them: “I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:7; Deut. 34:7">⚓</a><i>am</i> one hundred and twenty years old today. I can no longer <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:17; 1 Kin. 3:7">⚓</a>go out and come in. Also the Lord has said to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:12">⚓</a>‘You shall not cross over this Jordan.’ </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_3"><sup>3</sup>The Lord your God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:3; Josh. 11:23">⚓</a>Himself crosses over before you; He will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:18">⚓</a>Joshua himself crosses over before you, just <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:21">⚓</a>as the Lord has said. </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:21">⚓</a>And the Lord will do to them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:24, 33">⚓</a>as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites and their land, when He destroyed them. </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:2; 20:10–20">⚓</a>The Lord will give them over to you, that you may do to them according to every commandment which I have commanded you. </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:25; 1 Chr. 22:13">⚓</a>Be strong and of good courage, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:29">⚓</a>do not fear nor be afraid of them; for the Lord your God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:4">⚓</a>He <i>is</i> the One who goes with you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:5; Heb. 13:5">⚓</a>He will not leave you nor forsake you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_31_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:19; Deut. 31:23; Josh. 1:6">⚓</a>“Be strong and of good courage, for you must go with this people to the land which the Lord has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall cause them to inherit it. </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_8"><sup>8</sup>And the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:21">⚓</a>He <i>is</i> the One who goes before you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:6; Josh. 1:5; 1 Chr. 28:20; Heb. 13:5">⚓</a>He will be with you, He will not leave you nor forsake you; do not fear nor be dismayed.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Law to Be Read Every Seven Years</h3></div>
<span class="verse phu_31_9"> <sup>9</sup>So Moses wrote this law <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:18; 31:25, 26">⚓</a>and delivered it to the priests, the sons of Levi, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 4:5, 6, 15; Deut. 10:8; 31:25, 26; Josh. 3:3">⚓</a>who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_10"><sup>10</sup>And Moses commanded them, saying: “At the end of <i>every</i> seven years, at the appointed time in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 15:1, 2">⚓</a>year of release, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:34; Deut. 16:13">⚓</a>at the Feast of Tabernacles, </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_11"><sup>11</sup>when all Israel comes to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 16:16">⚓</a>appear before the Lord your God in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:5">⚓</a>place which He chooses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 8:34; 2 Kin. 23:2">⚓</a>you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing. </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:10">⚓</a>Gather the people together, men and women and little ones, and the stranger who <i>is</i> within your gates, that they may hear and that they may learn to fear the Lord your God and carefully observe all the words of this law, </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_13"><sup>13</sup>and <i>that</i> their children, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 11:2">⚓</a>who have not known it, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:6, 7">⚓</a>may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God as long as you live in the land which you cross the Jordan to possess.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Prediction of Israel’s Rebellion</h3></div>
<span class="verse phu_31_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then the Lord said to Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:13">⚓</a>“Behold, the days approach when you must die; call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of meeting, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:19; Deut. 3:28">⚓</a>I may inaugurate him.”<br/> So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of meeting. </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_15"><sup>15</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:9">⚓</a>the Lord appeared at the tabernacle in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood above the door of the tabernacle.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_31_16"> <sup>16</sup>And the Lord said to Moses: “Behold, you will rest with your fathers; and this people will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:22">⚓</a>rise and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:15; Deut. 4:25–28; Judg. 2:11, 12, 17">⚓</a>play the harlot with the gods of the foreigners of the land, where they go <i>to</i> <i>be</i> among them, and they will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:15">⚓</a>forsake Me and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:20">⚓</a>break My covenant which I have made with them. </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_17"><sup>17</sup>Then My anger shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:14; 6:13">⚓</a>aroused against them in that day, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 15:2">⚓</a>I will forsake them, and I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:20">⚓</a>hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured. And many evils and troubles shall befall them, so that they will say in that day, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:13">⚓</a>‘Have not these evils come upon us because our God <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:42">⚓</a>not among us?’ </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_18"><sup>18</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:17; (Is. 1:15, 16)">⚓</a>I will surely hide My face in that day because of all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other gods.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_31_19"> <sup>19</sup>“Now therefore, write down this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel; put it in their mouths, that this song may be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:22, 26">⚓</a>a witness for Me against the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_20"><sup>20</sup>When I have brought them to the land flowing with milk and honey, of which I swore to their fathers, and they have eaten and filled themselves <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:15–17">⚓</a>and grown fat, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:16">⚓</a>then they will turn to other gods and serve them; and they will provoke Me and break My covenant. </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_21"><sup>21</sup>Then it shall be, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:17">⚓</a>when many evils and troubles have come upon them, that this song will testify against them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten in the mouths of their descendants, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 5:3">⚓</a>I know the inclination <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 5:25, 26">⚓</a>of their behavior today, even before I have brought them to the land of which I swore <i>to</i> <i>give</i> <i>them.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_31_22"> <sup>22</sup>Therefore Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:23; Deut. 31:14">⚓</a>Then He inaugurated Joshua the son of Nun, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:7">⚓</a>“Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land of which I swore to them, and I will be with you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_31_24"> <sup>24</sup>So it was, when Moses had completed writing the words of this law in a book, when they were finished, </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_25"><sup>25</sup>that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying: </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_26"><sup>26</sup>“Take this Book of the Law, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 22:8">⚓</a>and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:19">⚓</a>as a witness against you; </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:7, 24">⚓</a>for I know your rebellion and your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:9; Deut. 9:6, 13">⚓</a>stiff neck. <i>If</i> today, while I am yet alive with you, you have been rebellious against the Lord, then how much more after my death? </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_28"><sup>28</sup>Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their hearing <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 30:19">⚓</a>and call heaven and earth to witness against them. </span>
<span class="verse phu_31_29"><sup>29</sup>For I know that after my death you will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:5; Judg. 2:19; (Acts 20:29, 30)">⚓</a>become utterly corrupt, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:15">⚓</a>evil will befall you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:1; Deut. 4:30">⚓</a>in the latter days, because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger through the work of your hands.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Song of Moses</h3></div>
<span class="verse phu_31_30"> <sup>30</sup>Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song until they were ended:<br/></span>
