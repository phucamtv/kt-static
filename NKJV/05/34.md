<span class="verse phu_34_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:12; Deut. 32:49">⚓</a>Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is across from Jericho. And the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead as far as Dan, </span>
<span class="verse phu_34_2"><sup>2</sup>all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea, </span>
<span class="verse phu_34_3"><sup>3</sup>the South, and the plain of the Valley of Jericho, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 28:15">⚓</a>the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. </span>
<span class="verse phu_34_4"><sup>4</sup>Then the Lord said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:7">⚓</a>“This <i>is</i> the land of which I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:27">⚓</a>I have caused you to see <i>it</i> with your eyes, but you shall not cross over there.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_34_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:12; Deut. 32:50; Josh. 1:1, 2">⚓</a>So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse phu_34_6"><sup>6</sup>And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth Peor; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jude 9">⚓</a>no one knows his grave to this day. </span>
<span class="verse phu_34_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:2">⚓</a>Moses <i>was</i> one hundred and twenty years old when he died. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:1; 48:10">⚓</a>His eyes were not dim nor his natural vigor diminished. </span>
<span class="verse phu_34_8"><sup>8</sup>And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:3, 10">⚓</a>thirty days. So the days of weeping <i>and</i> mourning for Moses ended.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_34_9"> <sup>9</sup>Now Joshua the son of Nun was full of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 11:2">⚓</a>spirit of wisdom, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:18, 23">⚓</a>Moses had laid his hands on him; so the children of Israel heeded him, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phu_34_10"> <sup>10</sup>But since then there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 18:15, 18">⚓</a>has not arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:11; Num. 12:8; Deut. 5:4">⚓</a>whom the Lord knew face to face, </span>
<span class="verse phu_34_11"><sup>11</sup>in all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:19">⚓</a>the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt, before Pharaoh, before all his servants, and in all his land, </span>
<span class="verse phu_34_12"><sup>12</sup>and by all that mighty power and all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.<br/></span>
