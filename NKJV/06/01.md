<span class="verse gios_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:13; Num. 13:16; 14:6, 29, 30, 37, 38; Deut. 1:38; Acts 7:45">⚓</a>assistant, saying: </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:7; Deut. 34:5">⚓</a>“Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them—the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 11:24; Josh. 11:23">⚓</a>Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you, as I said to Moses. </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:18; Ex. 23:31; Num. 34:3–12">⚓</a>From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the River Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your territory. </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:24">⚓</a>No man shall <i>be</i> <i>able</i> <i>to</i> stand before you all the days of your life; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:12">⚓</a>as I was with Moses, <i>so</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:8, 23">⚓</a>I will be with you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:6, 7; Heb. 13:5">⚓</a>I will not leave you nor forsake you. </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:7, 23">⚓</a>Be strong and of good courage, for to this people you shall divide as an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_7"><sup>7</sup>Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:23; Deut. 31:7; Josh. 11:15">⚓</a>which Moses My servant commanded you; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 5:32">⚓</a>do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go. </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:18, 19; 31:24, 26; Josh. 8:34">⚓</a>This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:9; Ps. 1:1–3">⚓</a>you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:7">⚓</a>Have I not commanded you?

<div class="title"><h3>The Order to Cross the Jordan</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_1_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_11"><sup>11</sup>“Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare provisions for yourselves, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:1; Josh. 3:17">⚓</a>within three days you will cross over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_1_12"> <sup>12</sup>And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh Joshua spoke, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_13"><sup>13</sup>“Remember <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:20–28">⚓</a>the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, ‘The Lord your God is giving you rest and is giving you this land.’ </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_14"><sup>14</sup>Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But you shall pass before your brethren armed, all your mighty men of valor, and help them, </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_15"><sup>15</sup>until the Lord has given your brethren rest, as He <i>gave</i> you, and they also have taken possession of the land which the Lord your God is giving them. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 22:1–4">⚓</a>Then you shall return to the land of your possession and enjoy it, which Moses the Lord’s servant gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrise.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_1_16"> <sup>16</sup>So they answered Joshua, saying, “All that you command us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_17"><sup>17</sup>Just as we heeded Moses in all things, so we will heed you. Only the Lord your God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:13; 1 Kin. 1:37">⚓</a>be with you, as He was with Moses. </span>
<span class="verse gios_1_18"><sup>18</sup>Whoever rebels against your command and does not heed your words, in all that you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.”<br/></span>
