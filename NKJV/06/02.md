<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Rahab Hides the Spies</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Joshua the son of Nun sent out two men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 25:1; Josh. 3:1">⚓</a>from Acacia Grove to spy secretly, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho.” So they went, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 11:31; James 2:25">⚓</a>came to the house of a harlot named <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:5">⚓</a>Rahab, and lodged there. </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_2"><sup>2</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:22">⚓</a>it was told the king of Jericho, saying, “Behold, men have come here tonight from the children of Israel to search out the country.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_2_3"> <sup>3</sup>So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the country.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_2_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:19, 20">⚓</a>Then the woman took the two men and hid them. So she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they <i>were</i> from. </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_5"><sup>5</sup>And it happened as the gate was being shut, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the men went I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_6"><sup>6</sup>(But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:17; 2 Sam. 17:19">⚓</a>she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.) </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_7"><sup>7</sup>Then the men pursued them by the road to the Jordan, to the fords. And as soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_2_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof, </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_9"><sup>9</sup>and said to the men: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:8">⚓</a>“I know that the Lord has given you the land, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:5; Ex. 23:27; Deut. 2:25; 11:25; Josh. 9:9, 10">⚓</a>the terror of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:15; Josh. 5:1">⚓</a>are fainthearted because of you. </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_10"><sup>10</sup>For we have heard how the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:21; Josh. 4:23">⚓</a>dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:21–35">⚓</a>what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who <i>were</i> on the other side of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:17; Josh. 6:21">⚓</a>utterly destroyed. </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_11"><sup>11</sup>And as soon as we <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:14, 15">⚓</a>heard <i>these</i> <i>things,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:1; 7:5; Ps. 22:14; Is. 13:7">⚓</a>our hearts melted; neither did there remain any more courage in anyone because of you, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:39">⚓</a>the Lord your God, He <i>is</i> God in heaven above and on earth beneath. </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_12"><sup>12</sup>Now therefore, I beg you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:14, 15, 17">⚓</a>swear to me by the Lord, since I have shown you kindness, that you also will show kindness to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 5:8">⚓</a>my father’s house, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:13; Josh. 2:18">⚓</a>give me a true token, </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_13"><sup>13</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 6:23–25">⚓</a>spare my father, my mother, my brothers, my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_2_14"> <sup>14</sup>So the men answered her, “Our lives for yours, if none of you tell this business of ours. And it shall be, when the Lord has given us the land, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:29; Judg. 1:24; (Matt. 5:7)">⚓</a>we will deal kindly and truly with you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_2_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then she <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:25">⚓</a>let them down by a rope through the window, for her house <i>was</i> on the city wall; she dwelt on the wall. </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_16"><sup>16</sup>And she said to them, “Get to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you. Hide there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward you may go your way.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_2_17"> <sup>17</sup>So the men said to her: “We <i>will</i> <i>be</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:7">⚓</a>blameless of this oath of yours which you have made us swear, </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:12">⚓</a>unless, <i>when</i> we come into the land, you bind this line of scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 6:23">⚓</a>and unless you bring your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household to your own home. </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_19"><sup>19</sup>So it shall be <i>that</i> whoever goes outside the doors of your house into the street, his blood <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> on his own head, and we <i>will</i> <i>be</i> guiltless. And whoever is with you in the house, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:32; Matt. 27:25">⚓</a>his blood <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> on our head if a hand is laid on him. </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_20"><sup>20</sup>And if you tell this business of ours, then we will be free from your oath which you made us swear.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_2_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then she said, “According to your words, so <i>be</i> it.” And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet cord in the window.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_2_22"> <sup>22</sup>They departed and went to the mountain, and stayed there three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers sought <i>them</i> all along the way, but did not find <i>them.</i></span>
<span class="verse gios_2_23"><sup>23</sup>So the two men returned, descended from the mountain, and crossed over; and they came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all that had befallen them. </span>
<span class="verse gios_2_24"><sup>24</sup>And they said to Joshua, “Truly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:31; Josh. 6:2; 21:44">⚓</a>the Lord has delivered all the land into our hands, for indeed all the inhabitants of the country are fainthearted because of us.”<br/></span>
