<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Israel Crosses the Jordan</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Joshua rose early in the morning; and they set out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:1">⚓</a>from Acacia Grove and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they crossed over. </span>
<span class="verse gios_3_2"><sup>2</sup>So it was, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:10, 11">⚓</a>after three days, that the officers went through the camp; </span>
<span class="verse gios_3_3"><sup>3</sup>and they commanded the people, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 10:33">⚓</a>“When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:9, 25">⚓</a>and the priests, the Levites, bearing it, then you shall set out from your place and go after it. </span>
<span class="verse gios_3_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:12">⚓</a>Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way by which you must go, for you have not passed <i>this</i> way before.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_3_5"> <sup>5</sup>And Joshua said to the people, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:10, 14, 15; Lev. 20:7; Num. 11:18; Josh. 7:13; 1 Sam. 16:5; Job 1:5; Joel 2:16">⚓</a>“Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_3_6"><sup>6</sup>Then Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 4:15">⚓</a>“Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over before the people.”<br/> So they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_3_7"> <sup>7</sup>And the Lord said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 4:14; 1 Chr. 29:25; 2 Chr. 1:1">⚓</a>exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:5, 9">⚓</a>as I was with Moses, <i>so</i> I will be with you. </span>
<span class="verse gios_3_8"><sup>8</sup>You shall command <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:3">⚓</a>the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you have come to the edge of the water of the Jordan, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:17">⚓</a>you shall stand in the Jordan.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_3_9"> <sup>9</sup>So Joshua said to the children of Israel, “Come here, and hear the words of the Lord your God.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_3_10"><sup>10</sup>And Joshua said, “By this you shall know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 5:26; Josh. 11:23; 1 Sam. 17:26; 2 Kin. 19:4; Hos. 1:10; Matt. 16:16; 1 Thess. 1:9">⚓</a>the living God <i>is</i> among you, and <i>that</i> He will without fail <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:2; Deut. 7:1; 18:12; Ps. 44:2">⚓</a>drive out from before you the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:19">⚓</a>Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perizzites and the Girgashites and the Amorites and the Jebusites: </span>
<span class="verse gios_3_11"><sup>11</sup>Behold, the ark of the covenant of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:13; Job 41:11; Ps. 24:1; Mic. 4:13; Zech. 4:14; 6:5">⚓</a>the Lord of all the earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan. </span>
<span class="verse gios_3_12"><sup>12</sup>Now therefore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 4:2, 4">⚓</a>take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from every tribe. </span>
<span class="verse gios_3_13"><sup>13</sup>And it shall come to pass, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:15, 16">⚓</a>as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:11">⚓</a>the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, <i>that</i> the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, the waters that come down from upstream, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:13; 114:3">⚓</a>shall stand as a heap.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_3_14"> <sup>14</sup>So it was, when the people set out from their camp to cross over the Jordan, with the priests bearing the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 132:8; Acts 7:44, 45">⚓</a>ark of the covenant before the people, </span>
<span class="verse gios_3_15"><sup>15</sup>and as those who bore the ark came to the Jordan, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:13">⚓</a>the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water (for the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 12:15; Jer. 12:5; 49:19">⚓</a>Jordan overflows all its banks <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 4:18; 5:10, 12">⚓</a>during the whole time of harvest), </span>
<span class="verse gios_3_16"><sup>16</sup>that the waters which came down from upstream stood <i>still, and</i> rose in a heap very far away at Adam, the city that <i>is</i> beside <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 4:12; 7:46">⚓</a>Zaretan. So the waters that went down <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:17">⚓</a>into the Sea of the Arabah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:3; Num. 34:3">⚓</a>the Salt Sea, failed, <i>and</i> were cut off; and the people crossed over opposite Jericho. </span>
<span class="verse gios_3_17"><sup>17</sup>Then the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:24; Ex. 3:8; 6:1–8; 14:21, 22, 29; 33:1; Deut. 6:10; Heb. 11:29">⚓</a>and all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until all the people had crossed completely over the Jordan.<br/></span>
