<span class="verse gios_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>And it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 27:2; Josh. 3:17">⚓</a>over the Jordan, that the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying: </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:12">⚓</a>“Take for yourselves twelve men from the people, one man from every tribe, </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_3"><sup>3</sup>and command them, saying, ‘Take for yourselves twelve stones from here, out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:13">⚓</a>the priests’ feet stood firm. You shall carry them over with you and leave them in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 4:19, 20">⚓</a>the lodging place where you lodge tonight.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_4_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the children of Israel, one man from every tribe; </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_5"><sup>5</sup>and Joshua said to them: “Cross over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of the Jordan, and each one of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_6"><sup>6</sup>that this may be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 27:2; Ps. 103:2">⚓</a>a sign among you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:26; 13:14; Deut. 6:20">⚓</a>when your children ask in time to come, saying, ‘What do these stones <i>mean</i> to you?’ </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_7"><sup>7</sup>Then you shall answer them that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:13, 16">⚓</a>the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it crossed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:14; Num. 16:40">⚓</a>a memorial to the children of Israel forever.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_4_8"> <sup>8</sup>And the children of Israel did so, just as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of the Jordan, as the Lord had spoken to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_9"><sup>9</sup>Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_4_10"> <sup>10</sup>So the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the Lord had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and crossed over. </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_11"><sup>11</sup>Then it came to pass, when all the people had completely crossed over, that the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:11; 6:11">⚓</a>ark of the Lord and the priests crossed over in the presence of the people. </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_12"><sup>12</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:17, 20, 27, 28; Josh. 1:14">⚓</a>the men of Reuben, the men of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses had spoken to them. </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_13"><sup>13</sup>About forty thousand prepared for war crossed over before the Lord for battle, to the plains of Jericho. </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_14"><sup>14</sup>On that day the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:7; 1 Chr. 29:25">⚓</a>exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_4_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_16"><sup>16</sup>“Command the priests who bear <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:16, 22">⚓</a>the ark of the Testimony to come up from the Jordan.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_17"><sup>17</sup>Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_18"><sup>18</sup>And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord had come from the midst of the Jordan, <i>and</i> the soles of the priests’ feet touched the dry land, that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:15; 1 Chr. 12:15">⚓</a>and overflowed all its banks as before.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_4_19"> <sup>19</sup>Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth <i>day</i> of the first month, and they camped <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:9">⚓</a>in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho. </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_20"><sup>20</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 11:30; Josh. 4:3; 5:9, 10">⚓</a>those twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal. </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_21"><sup>21</sup>Then he spoke to the children of Israel, saying: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 4:6">⚓</a>“When your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, ‘What <i>are</i> these stones?’ </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_22"><sup>22</sup>then you shall let your children know, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:26, 27; 13:8–14; Deut. 26:5–9">⚓</a>‘Israel crossed over this Jordan on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:17">⚓</a>dry land’; </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_23"><sup>23</sup>for the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:21">⚓</a>which He dried up before us until we had crossed over, </span>
<span class="verse gios_4_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:42; 2 Kin. 19:19; Ps. 106:8">⚓</a>that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of the Lord, that it <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:16; 1 Chr. 29:12; Ps. 89:13">⚓</a>mighty, that you may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:31; Deut. 6:2; Ps. 76:7; Jer. 10:7">⚓</a>fear the Lord your God forever.”<br/></span>
