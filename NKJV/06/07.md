<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>Defeat at Ai</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>But the children of Israel committed a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:20, 21">⚓</a>trespass regarding the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 6:17–19">⚓</a>accursed things, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 22:20">⚓</a>Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed things; so the anger of the Lord burned against the children of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_7_2"> <sup>2</sup>Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which <i>is</i> beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy out the country.” So the men went up and spied out Ai. </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_3"><sup>3</sup>And they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai. Do not weary all the people there, for <i>the</i> <i>people</i> <i>of</i> <i>Ai</i> <i>are</i> few.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_4"><sup>4</sup>So about three thousand men went up there from the people, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:17; Deut. 28:25">⚓</a>but they fled before the men of Ai. </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_5"><sup>5</sup>And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six men, for they chased them <i>from</i> before the gate as far as Shebarim, and struck them down on the descent; therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:36; Josh. 2:9, 11">⚓</a>the hearts of the people melted and became like water.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_7_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then Joshua <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:29, 34">⚓</a>tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of the Lord until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 4:12">⚓</a>put dust on their heads. </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_7"><sup>7</sup>And Joshua said, “Alas, Lord God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:3; Num. 21:5">⚓</a>why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all—to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? Oh, that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan! </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_8"><sup>8</sup>O Lord, what shall I say when Israel turns its back before its enemies? </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_9"><sup>9</sup>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear <i>it,</i> and surround us, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:26">⚓</a>cut off our name from the earth. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:12; Num. 14:13">⚓</a>what will You do for Your great name?”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Sin of Achan</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_7_10"> <sup>10</sup>So the Lord said to Joshua: “Get up! Why do you lie thus on your face? </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_11"><sup>11</sup>Israel has sinned, and they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 6:17–19">⚓</a>For they have even taken some of the accursed things, and have both stolen and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:1, 2">⚓</a>deceived; and they have also put <i>it</i> among their own stuff. </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:14">⚓</a>Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, <i>but</i> turned <i>their</i> backs before their enemies, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:26; (Hag. 2:13, 14)">⚓</a>they have become doomed to destruction. Neither will I be with you anymore, unless you destroy the accursed from among you. </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_13"><sup>13</sup>Get up, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:10">⚓</a>sanctify the people, and say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:5">⚓</a>‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, because thus says the Lord God of Israel: “<i>There</i> <i>is</i> an accursed thing in your midst, O Israel; you cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the accursed thing from among you.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_14"><sup>14</sup>In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes. And it shall be <i>that</i> the tribe which <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 16:33)">⚓</a>the Lord takes shall come according to families; and the family which the Lord takes shall come by households; and the household which the Lord takes shall come man by man. </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:38, 39">⚓</a>Then it shall be <i>that</i> he who is taken with the accursed thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:11">⚓</a>transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and because he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:7; Judg. 20:6">⚓</a>has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_7_16"> <sup>16</sup>So Joshua rose early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken. </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_17"><sup>17</sup>He brought the clan of Judah, and he took the family of the Zarhites; and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man, and Zabdi was taken. </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_18"><sup>18</sup>Then he brought his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:42">⚓</a>was taken.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_7_19"> <sup>19</sup>Now Joshua said to Achan, “My son, I beg you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 6:5; Jer. 13:16; John 9:24">⚓</a>give glory to the Lord God of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 5:6, 7; 2 Chr. 30:22; Ezra 10:10, 11; Ps. 32:5; Prov. 28:13; Jer. 3:12, 13; Dan. 9:4">⚓</a>and make confession to Him, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:43">⚓</a>tell me now what you have done; do not hide <i>it</i> from me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_7_20"> <sup>20</sup>And Achan answered Joshua and said, “Indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:34; 1 Sam. 15:24">⚓</a>I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and this is what I have done: </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_21"><sup>21</sup>When I saw among the spoils a beautiful Babylonian garment, two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. And there they are, hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, with the silver under it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_7_22"> <sup>22</sup>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver under it. </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_23"><sup>23</sup>And they took them from the midst of the tent, brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_24"><sup>24</sup>Then Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the garment, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:32, 33; Dan. 6:24">⚓</a>all that he had, and they brought them to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:26; 15:7">⚓</a>the Valley of Achor. </span>
<span class="verse gios_7_25"><sup>25</sup>And Joshua said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 6:18; 1 Chr. 2:7; (Gal. 5:12)">⚓</a>“Why have you troubled us? The Lord will trouble you this day.” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:5">⚓</a>So all Israel stoned him with stones; and they burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_7_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 8:29; 2 Sam. 18:17; Lam. 3:53">⚓</a>raised over him a great heap of stones, still there to this day. So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:17">⚓</a>the Lord turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:24; Is. 65:10; Hos. 2:15">⚓</a>the Valley of Achor to this day.<br/></span>
