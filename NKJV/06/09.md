<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>The Treaty with the Gibeonites</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>And it came to pass when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:29; Josh. 3:10">⚓</a>all the kings who <i>were</i> on this side of the Jordan, in the hills and in the lowland and in all the coasts of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 34:6">⚓</a>the Great Sea toward Lebanon—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:17; 23:23">⚓</a>the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite—heard <i>about</i> <i>it,</i></span>
<span class="verse gios_9_2"><sup>2</sup>that they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:5; Ps. 83:3, 5">⚓</a>gathered together to fight with Joshua and Israel with one accord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_9_3"> <sup>3</sup>But when the inhabitants of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:17, 22; 10:2; 21:17; 2 Sam. 21:1, 2">⚓</a>Gibeon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 6:27">⚓</a>heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_4"><sup>4</sup>they worked craftily, and went and pretended to be ambassadors. And they took old sacks on their donkeys, old wineskins torn and mended, </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_5"><sup>5</sup>old and patched sandals on their feet, and old garments on themselves; and all the bread of their provision was dry <i>and</i> moldy. </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_6"><sup>6</sup>And they went to Joshua, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:10">⚓</a>to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country; now therefore, make a covenant with us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_9_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then the men of Israel said to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:1; 11:19">⚓</a>Hivites, “Perhaps you dwell among us; so <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:32; Deut. 7:2">⚓</a>how can we make a covenant with you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_9_8"> <sup>8</sup>But they said to Joshua, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:11; 2 Kin. 10:5">⚓</a>“We <i>are</i> your servants.”<br/> And Joshua said to them, “Who <i>are</i> you, and where do you come from?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_9_9"> <sup>9</sup>So they said to him: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:15">⚓</a>“From a very far country your servants have come, because of the name of the Lord your God; for we have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:14; Josh. 2:9, 10; 5:1">⚓</a>heard of His fame, and all that He did in Egypt, </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_10"><sup>10</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:24, 33">⚓</a>all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who <i>were</i> beyond the Jordan—to Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth. </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_11"><sup>11</sup>Therefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, ‘Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, “We <i>are</i> your servants; now therefore, make a covenant with us.” ’ </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_12"><sup>12</sup>This bread of ours we took hot <i>for</i> our provision from our houses on the day we departed to come to you. But now look, it is dry and moldy. </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_13"><sup>13</sup>And these wineskins which we filled <i>were</i> new, and see, they are torn; and these our garments and our sandals have become old because of the very long journey.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_9_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then the men of Israel took some of their provisions; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:21; Is. 30:1">⚓</a>but they did not ask counsel of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_15"><sup>15</sup>So Joshua <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 21:2">⚓</a>made peace with them, and made a covenant with them to let them live; and the rulers of the congregation swore to them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_9_16"> <sup>16</sup>And it happened at the end of three days, after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they <i>were</i> their neighbors who dwelt near them. </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_17"><sup>17</sup>Then the children of Israel journeyed and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:25">⚓</a>Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjath Jearim. </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_18"><sup>18</sup>But the children of Israel did not attack them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 15:4">⚓</a>because the rulers of the congregation had sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel. And all the congregation complained against the rulers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_9_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then all the rulers said to all the congregation, “We have sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel; now therefore, we may not touch them. </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_20"><sup>20</sup>This we will do to them: We will let them live, lest <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 21:1, 2, 6; Ezek. 17:13, 15">⚓</a>wrath be upon us because of the oath which we swore to them.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_21"><sup>21</sup>And the rulers said to them, “Let them live, but let them be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:11">⚓</a>woodcutters and water carriers for all the congregation, as the rulers had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:15">⚓</a>promised them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_9_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:6, 9">⚓</a>‘We <i>are</i> very far from you,’ when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:16">⚓</a>you dwell near us? </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_23"><sup>23</sup>Now therefore, you <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:25">⚓</a>cursed, and none of you shall be freed from being slaves—woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_9_24"> <sup>24</sup>So they answered Joshua and said, “Because your servants were clearly told that the Lord your God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:31–33; Deut. 7:1, 2">⚓</a>commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:14">⚓</a>we were very much afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing. </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_25"><sup>25</sup>And now, here we are, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:6">⚓</a>in your hands; do with us as it seems good and right to do to us.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_26"><sup>26</sup>So he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, so that they did not kill them. </span>
<span class="verse gios_9_27"><sup>27</sup>And that day Joshua made them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:21, 23">⚓</a>woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:5">⚓</a>in the place which He would choose, even to this day.<br/></span>
