<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>The Sun Stands Still</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:1">⚓</a>heard how Joshua had taken <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 8:1">⚓</a>Ai and had utterly destroyed it—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 6:21">⚓</a>as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 8:22, 26, 28">⚓</a>Ai and its king—and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:15">⚓</a>how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them, </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_2"><sup>2</sup>that they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:14–16; Deut. 11:25; 1 Chr. 14:17">⚓</a>feared greatly, because Gibeon <i>was</i> a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it <i>was</i> greater than Ai, and all its men <i>were</i> mighty. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_3"><sup>3</sup>Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_4"><sup>4</sup>“Come up to me and help me, that we may attack Gibeon, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:15; 10:1">⚓</a>it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_5"><sup>5</sup>Therefore the five kings of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:29">⚓</a>Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, <i>and</i> the king of Eglon, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:2">⚓</a>gathered together and went up, they and all their armies, and camped before Gibeon and made war against it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_6"> <sup>6</sup>And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:10; 9:6">⚓</a>at Gilgal, saying, “Do not forsake your servants; come up to us quickly, save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the mountains have gathered together against us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_7"> <sup>7</sup>So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 8:1">⚓</a>all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_8"><sup>8</sup>And the Lord said to Joshua, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 11:6; Judg. 4:14">⚓</a>“Do not fear them, for I have delivered them into your hand; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:5, 9">⚓</a>not a man of them shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 21:44">⚓</a>stand before you.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_9"><sup>9</sup>Joshua therefore came upon them suddenly, having marched all night from Gilgal. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_10"><sup>10</sup>So the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 4:15; 1 Sam. 7:10, 12; Is. 28:21">⚓</a>routed them before Israel, killed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, chased them along the road that goes <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:3, 5">⚓</a>to Beth Horon, and struck them down as far as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:35">⚓</a>Azekah and Makkedah. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_11"><sup>11</sup>And it happened, as they fled before Israel <i>and</i> were on the descent of Beth Horon, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 30:30; Rev. 16:21">⚓</a>that the Lord cast down large hailstones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died. <i>There</i> <i>were</i> more who died from the hailstones than the children of Israel killed with the sword.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then Joshua spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 28:21; Hab. 3:11">⚓</a>“Sun, stand still over Gibeon;<br/>   And Moon, in the Valley of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 12:12">⚓</a>Aijalon.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_13">   <sup>13</sup>So the sun stood still,<br/>   And the moon stopped,<br/>   Till the people had revenge<br/>   Upon their enemies.<br/> <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:18">⚓</a><i>Is</i> this not written in the Book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go <i>down</i> for about a whole day. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_14"><sup>14</sup>And there has been <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 38:7, 8">⚓</a>no day like that, before it or after it, that the Lord heeded the voice of a man; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:14; Deut. 1:30; 20:4; Josh. 10:42; 23:3">⚓</a>the Lord fought for Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:43">⚓</a>Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Amorite Kings Executed</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_10_16"> <sup>16</sup>But these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in a cave at Makkedah. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_17"><sup>17</sup>And it was told Joshua, saying, “The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_18"> <sup>18</sup>So Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_19"><sup>19</sup>And do not stay <i>there</i> yourselves, <i>but</i> pursue your enemies, and attack their rear <i>guard.</i> Do not allow them to enter their cities, for the Lord your God has delivered them into your hand.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_20"><sup>20</sup>Then it happened, while Joshua and the children of Israel made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they had finished, that those who escaped entered fortified cities. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_21"><sup>21</sup>And all the people returned to the camp, to Joshua at Makkedah, in peace.<br/> <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 11:7">⚓</a>No one moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings to me from the cave.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_23"><sup>23</sup>And they did so, and brought out those five kings to him from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, <i>and</i> the king of Eglon.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_24"> <sup>24</sup>So it was, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” And they drew near and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 107:40; Is. 26:5, 6; Mal. 4:3">⚓</a>put their feet on their necks. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_25"><sup>25</sup>Then Joshua said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:6–8; Josh. 1:9">⚓</a>“Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:21; 7:19">⚓</a>thus the Lord will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_26"><sup>26</sup>And afterward Joshua struck them and killed them, and hanged them on five trees; and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 8:29; 2 Sam. 21:9">⚓</a>were hanging on the trees until evening. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_27"><sup>27</sup>So it was at the time of the going down of the sun <i>that</i> Joshua commanded, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 21:22, 23; Josh. 8:29">⚓</a>took them down from the trees, cast them into the cave where they had been hidden, and laid large stones against the cave’s mouth, <i>which</i> <i>remain</i> until this very day.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Conquest of the Southland</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_10_28"> <sup>28</sup>On that day Joshua took Makkedah, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword. He utterly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:2, 16">⚓</a>destroyed them—all the people who <i>were</i> in it. He let none remain. He also did to the king of Makkedah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 6:21">⚓</a>as he had done to the king of Jericho.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:42; 21:13; 2 Kin. 8:22; 19:8">⚓</a>Libnah; and they fought against Libnah. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_30"><sup>30</sup>And the Lord also delivered it and its king into the hand of Israel; he struck it and all the people who <i>were</i> in it with the edge of the sword. He let none remain in it, but did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish; and they encamped against it and fought against it. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_32"><sup>32</sup>And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and struck it and all the people who <i>were</i> in it with the edge of the sword, according to all that he had done to Libnah. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_33"><sup>33</sup>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he left him none remaining.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_34"> <sup>34</sup>From Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it and fought against it. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_35"><sup>35</sup>They took it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; all the people who <i>were</i> in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_36"> <sup>36</sup>So Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:22; Josh. 14:13–15; 15:13; Judg. 1:10, 20; 2 Sam. 5:1, 3, 5, 13; 2 Chr. 11:10">⚓</a>Hebron; and they fought against it. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_37"><sup>37</sup>And they took it and struck it with the edge of the sword—its king, all its cities, and all the people who <i>were</i> in it; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon, but utterly destroyed it and all the people who <i>were</i> in it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_38"> <sup>38</sup>Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:15; Judg. 1:11; 1 Chr. 6:58">⚓</a>Debir; and they fought against it. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_39"><sup>39</sup>And he took it and its king and all its cities; they struck them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the people who <i>were</i> in it. He left none remaining; as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and its king, as he had done also to Libnah and its king.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_10_40"> <sup>40</sup>So Joshua conquered all the land: the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:7">⚓</a>mountain country and the South and the lowland and the wilderness slopes, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:24">⚓</a>all their kings; he left none remaining, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:16, 17">⚓</a>utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord God of Israel had commanded. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_41"><sup>41</sup>And Joshua conquered them from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:26; Deut. 9:23">⚓</a>Kadesh Barnea as far as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 10:19; Josh. 11:22">⚓</a>Gaza, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 11:16; 15:51">⚓</a>and all the country of Goshen, even as far as Gibeon. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_42"><sup>42</sup>All these kings and their land Joshua took at one time, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:14">⚓</a>because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel. </span>
<span class="verse gios_10_43"><sup>43</sup>Then Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.<br/></span>
