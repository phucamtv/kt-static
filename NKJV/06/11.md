<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>The Northern Conquest</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor heard <i>these</i> <i>things,</i> that he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:3">⚓</a>sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:15">⚓</a>of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph, </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_2"><sup>2</sup>and to the kings who <i>were</i> from the north, in the mountains, in the plain south of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 34:11">⚓</a>Chinneroth, in the lowland, and in the heights <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 17:11; Judg. 1:27; 1 Kin. 4:11">⚓</a>of Dor on the west, </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_3"><sup>3</sup>to the Canaanites in the east and in the west, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:1">⚓</a>Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite in the mountains, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:1; Judg. 3:3, 5; 1 Kin. 9:20">⚓</a>and the Hivite below <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 11:17; 13:5, 11">⚓</a>Hermon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:49">⚓</a>in the land of Mizpah. </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_4"><sup>4</sup>So they went out, they and all their armies with them, <i>as</i> many people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:17; 32:12; Judg. 7:12; 1 Sam. 13:5">⚓</a><i>as</i> the sand that <i>is</i> on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots. </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_5"><sup>5</sup>And when all these kings had met together, they came and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_11_6"> <sup>6</sup>But the Lord said to Joshua, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:8">⚓</a>“Do not be afraid because of them, for tomorrow about this time I will deliver all of them slain before Israel. You shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:4">⚓</a>hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_7"><sup>7</sup>So Joshua and all the people of war with him came against them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and they attacked them. </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_8"><sup>8</sup>And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel, who defeated them and chased them to Greater <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:13">⚓</a>Sidon, to the Brook <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 13:6">⚓</a>Misrephoth, and to the Valley of Mizpah eastward; they attacked them until they left none of them remaining. </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_9"><sup>9</sup>So Joshua did to them as the Lord had told him: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_11_10"> <sup>10</sup>Joshua turned back at that time and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor was formerly the head of all those kingdoms. </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_11"><sup>11</sup>And they struck all the people who <i>were</i> in it with the edge of the sword, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:16">⚓</a>utterly destroying <i>them.</i> There was none left <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:40">⚓</a>breathing. Then he burned Hazor with fire.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_11_12"> <sup>12</sup>So all the cities of those kings, and all their kings, Joshua took and struck with the edge of the sword. He utterly destroyed them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:50–56; Deut. 7:2; 20:16">⚓</a>as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded. </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_13"><sup>13</sup>But <i>as</i> <i>for</i> the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only, <i>which</i> Joshua burned. </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_14"><sup>14</sup>And all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:14–18">⚓</a>spoil of these cities and the livestock, the children of Israel took as booty for themselves; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, and they left none breathing. </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:10–17">⚓</a>As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:7, 8">⚓</a>Moses commanded Joshua, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:7">⚓</a>so Joshua did. He left nothing undone of all that the Lord had commanded Moses.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Summary of Joshua’s Conquests</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_11_16"> <sup>16</sup>Thus Joshua took all this land: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 12:8">⚓</a>the mountain country, all the South, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:40, 41">⚓</a>all the land of Goshen, the lowland, and the Jordan plain—the mountains of Israel and its lowlands, </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 12:7">⚓</a>from Mount Halak and the ascent to Seir, even as far as Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:24">⚓</a>all their kings, and struck them down and killed them. </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_18"><sup>18</sup>Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_19"><sup>19</sup>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:3–7">⚓</a>the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. All <i>the</i> <i>others</i> they took in battle. </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_20"><sup>20</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:30">⚓</a>it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that He might utterly destroy them, <i>and</i> that they might receive no mercy, but that He might destroy them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:16, 17">⚓</a>as the Lord had commanded Moses.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_11_21"> <sup>21</sup>And at that time Joshua came and cut off <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:22, 33; Deut. 1:28; 9:2; Josh. 15:13, 14">⚓</a>the Anakim from the mountains: from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel; Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities. </span>
<span class="verse gios_11_22"><sup>22</sup>None of the Anakim were left in the land of the children of Israel; they remained only <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:4">⚓</a>in Gaza, in Gath, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:46; 1 Sam. 5:1; Is. 20:1">⚓</a>and in Ashdod.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_11_23"> <sup>23</sup>So Joshua took the whole land, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:2; Num. 34:2–15">⚓</a>according to all that the Lord had said to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:53; Josh. 14; 15">⚓</a>according to their divisions by their tribes. Then the land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:9, 10; 25:19; (Heb. 4:8)">⚓</a>rested from war.<br/></span>
