<div class="title"><h1>14</h1><h3>The Land Divided West of the Jordan</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_14_1"> <sup>1</sup>These <i>are</i> <i>the</i> <i>areas</i> which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 34:16–29">⚓</a>which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed as an inheritance to them. </span>
<span class="verse gios_14_2"><sup>2</sup>Their inheritance <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:55; 33:54; 34:13; Ps. 16:5">⚓</a>by lot, as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe. </span>
<span class="verse gios_14_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:33; Josh. 13:8, 32, 33">⚓</a>For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe on the other side of the Jordan; but to the Levites he had given no inheritance among them. </span>

<span class="verse gios_14_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:11, 12">⚓</a>Kenizzite said to him: “You know <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:24, 30">⚓</a>the word which the Lord said to Moses the man of God concerning <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:26">⚓</a>you and me in Kadesh Barnea. </span>
<span class="verse gios_14_7"><sup>7</sup>I <i>was</i> forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:6, 17; 14:6">⚓</a>sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land, and I brought back word to him as <i>it</i> <i>was</i> in my heart. </span>

<span class="verse gios_14_9"><sup>9</sup>So Moses swore on that day, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:23, 24">⚓</a>‘Surely the land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:22; Deut. 1:36">⚓</a>where your foot has trodden shall be your inheritance and your children’s forever, because you have wholly followed the Lord my God.’ </span>
<span class="verse gios_14_10"><sup>10</sup>And now, behold, the Lord has kept me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:24, 30, 38">⚓</a>alive, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:6; Neh. 9:21">⚓</a>as He said, these forty-five years, ever since the Lord spoke this word to Moses while Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now, here I am this day, eighty-five years old. </span>

<span class="verse gios_14_12"><sup>12</sup>Now therefore, give me this mountain of which the Lord spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:28, 33">⚓</a>the Anakim <i>were</i> there, and <i>that</i> the cities <i>were</i> great <i>and</i> fortified. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 8:31">⚓</a>It may be that the Lord<i>will</i> <i>be</i> with me, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:14; Judg. 1:20">⚓</a>I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said.”<br/></span>
