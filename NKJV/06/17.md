<div class="title"><h1>17</h1><h3>The Other Half-Tribe of Manasseh (West)</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he <i>was</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:51; 46:20; 48:18">⚓</a>firstborn of Joseph: <i>namely</i> for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:23; Judg. 5:14">⚓</a>Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war; therefore he was given <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:15">⚓</a>Gilead and Bashan. </span>
<span class="verse gios_17_2"><sup>2</sup>And there was <i>a</i> <i>lot</i> for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:29–33">⚓</a>the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 7:18">⚓</a>for the children of Abiezer, the children of Helek, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:31">⚓</a>the children of Asriel, the children of Shechem, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:32">⚓</a>the children of Hepher, and the children of Shemida; these <i>were</i> the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_17_3"> <sup>3</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:33; 27:1; 36:2">⚓</a>Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but only daughters. And these <i>are</i> the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. </span>
<span class="verse gios_17_4"><sup>4</sup>And they came near before <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 14:1">⚓</a>Eleazar the priest, before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the rulers, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:2–11">⚓</a>“The Lord commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” Therefore, according to the commandment of the Lord, he gave them an inheritance among their father’s brothers. </span>
<span class="verse gios_17_5"><sup>5</sup>Ten shares fell to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 22:7">⚓</a>Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which <i>were</i> on the other side of the Jordan, </span>
<span class="verse gios_17_6"><sup>6</sup>because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons; and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land of Gilead.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_17_7"> <sup>7</sup>And the territory of Manasseh was from Asher to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:6">⚓</a>Michmethath, that <i>lies</i> east of Shechem; and the border went along south to the inhabitants of En Tappuah. </span>
<span class="verse gios_17_8"><sup>8</sup>Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:8">⚓</a>Tappuah on the border of Manasseh <i>belonged</i> to the children of Ephraim. </span>
<span class="verse gios_17_9"><sup>9</sup>And the border descended to the Brook Kanah, southward to the brook. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:9">⚓</a>These cities of Ephraim <i>are</i> among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh <i>was</i> on the north side of the brook; and it ended at the sea.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_17_10"> <sup>10</sup>Southward <i>it</i> <i>was</i> Ephraim’s, northward <i>it</i> <i>was</i> Manasseh’s, and the sea was its border. Manasseh’s territory was adjoining Asher on the north and Issachar on the east. </span>
<span class="verse gios_17_11"><sup>11</sup>And in Issachar and in Asher, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 7:29">⚓</a>Manasseh had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:27; 1 Sam. 31:10; 1 Kin. 4:12">⚓</a>Beth Shean and its towns, Ibleam and its towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of En Dor and its towns, the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns—three hilly regions. </span>
<span class="verse gios_17_12"><sup>12</sup>Yet <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:19, 27, 28">⚓</a>the children of Manasseh could not drive out <i>the</i> <i>inhabitants</i> <i>of</i> those cities, but the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land. </span>
<span class="verse gios_17_13"><sup>13</sup>And it happened, when the children of Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:10">⚓</a>forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>More Land for Ephraim and Manasseh</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_17_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:4">⚓</a>Then the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given us <i>only</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:22">⚓</a>one lot and one share to inherit, since we <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:19; Num. 26:34, 37">⚓</a>a great people, inasmuch as the Lord has blessed us until now?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_17_15"> <sup>15</sup>So Joshua answered them, “If you <i>are</i> a great people, <i>then</i> go up to the forest <i>country</i> and clear a place for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and the giants, since the mountains of Ephraim are too confined for you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_17_16"> <sup>16</sup>But the children of Joseph said, “The mountain country is not enough for us; and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 17:18; Judg. 1:19; 4:3">⚓</a>chariots of iron, <i>both</i> <i>those</i> who <i>are</i> of Beth Shean and its towns and <i>those</i> who <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:18; 1 Kin. 4:12">⚓</a>of the Valley of Jezreel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_17_17"> <sup>17</sup>And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh—saying, “You <i>are</i> a great people and have great power; you shall not have <i>only</i> one lot, </span>
<span class="verse gios_17_18"><sup>18</sup>but the mountain country shall be yours. Although it <i>is</i> wooded, you shall cut it down, and its farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:1">⚓</a>though they have iron chariots <i>and</i> are strong.”<br/></span>
