<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>The Remainder of the Land Divided</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:51; 21:2; 22:9; Jer. 7:12">⚓</a>at Shiloh, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 18:31; 1 Sam. 1:3, 24; 4:3, 4">⚓</a>set up the tabernacle of meeting there. And the land was subdued before them. </span>
<span class="verse gios_18_2"><sup>2</sup>But there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not yet received their inheritance.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_18_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then Joshua said to the children of Israel: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 18:9">⚓</a>“How long will you neglect to go and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers has given you? </span>
<span class="verse gios_18_4"><sup>4</sup>Pick out from among you three men for <i>each</i> tribe, and I will send them; they shall rise and go through the land, survey it according to their inheritance, and come <i>back</i> to me. </span>
<span class="verse gios_18_5"><sup>5</sup>And they shall divide it into seven parts. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:1">⚓</a>Judah shall remain in their territory on the south, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:1—17:18">⚓</a>house of Joseph shall remain in their territory on the north. </span>
<span class="verse gios_18_6"><sup>6</sup>You shall therefore survey the land in seven parts and bring <i>the</i> <i>survey</i> here to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 14:2; 18:10">⚓</a>that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord our God. </span>
<span class="verse gios_18_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 18:7, 20; Josh. 13:33">⚓</a>But the Levites have no part among you, for the priesthood of the Lord<i>is</i> their inheritance. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 13:8">⚓</a>And Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_18_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then the men arose to go away; and Joshua charged those who went to survey the land, saying, “Go, walk <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:17">⚓</a>through the land, survey it, and come back to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the Lord in Shiloh.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_18_9"><sup>9</sup>So the men went, passed through the land, and wrote the survey in a book in seven parts by cities; and they came to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh. </span>
<span class="verse gios_18_10"><sup>10</sup>Then Joshua cast <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:19">⚓</a>lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord, and there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 34:16–29; Josh. 19:51">⚓</a>Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Land of Benjamin</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_18_11"> <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:21">⚓</a>Now the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot came out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. </span>
<span class="verse gios_18_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:1">⚓</a>Their border on the north side began at the Jordan, and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the mountains westward; it ended at the Wilderness of Beth Aven. </span>
<span class="verse gios_18_13"><sup>13</sup>The border went over from there toward Luz, to the side of Luz <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:19; Josh. 16:2; Judg. 1:23">⚓</a>(which <i>is</i> Bethel) southward; and the border descended to Ataroth Addar, near the hill that <i>lies</i> on the south side <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:3">⚓</a>of Lower Beth Horon.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_18_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then the border extended around the west side to the south, from the hill that <i>lies</i> before Beth Horon southward; and it ended at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:9">⚓</a>Kirjath Baal (which <i>is</i> Kirjath Jearim), a city of the children of Judah.

<span class="verse gios_18_16"><sup>16</sup>Then the border came down to the end of the mountain that <i>lies</i> before <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:8">⚓</a>the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, which <i>is</i> in the Valley of the Rephaim on the north, descended to the Valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite <i>city</i> on the south, and descended to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:7">⚓</a>En Rogel. </span>
<span class="verse gios_18_17"><sup>17</sup>And it went around from the north, went out to En Shemesh, and extended toward Geliloth, which is before the Ascent of Adummim, and descended to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:6">⚓</a>the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. </span>
<span class="verse gios_18_18"><sup>18</sup>Then it passed along toward the north side of Arabah, and went down to Arabah. </span>
<span class="verse gios_18_19"><sup>19</sup>And the border passed along to the north side of Beth Hoglah; then the border ended at the north bay at the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:2, 5">⚓</a>Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan.

<span class="verse gios_18_20"> <sup>20</sup>The Jordan was its border on the east side. This <i>was</i> the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, according to its boundaries all around, according to their families.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_18_21"> <sup>21</sup>Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, according to their families, were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz, </span>
