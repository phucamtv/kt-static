<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>The Cities of Refuge</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>The Lord also spoke to Joshua, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gios_20_2"><sup>2</sup>“Speak to the children of Israel, saying: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 21:13; Num. 35:6–34; Deut. 19:2, 9">⚓</a>‘Appoint for yourselves cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses, </span>
<span class="verse gios_20_3"><sup>3</sup>that the slayer who kills a person accidentally <i>or</i> unintentionally may flee there; and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood. </span>
<span class="verse gios_20_4"><sup>4</sup>And when he flees to one of those cities, and stands at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declares his case in the hearing of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city as one of them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. </span>
<span class="verse gios_20_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:12">⚓</a>Then if the avenger of blood pursues him, they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand, because he struck his neighbor unintentionally, but did not hate him beforehand. </span>
<span class="verse gios_20_6"><sup>6</sup>And he shall dwell in that city <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:12, 24, 25">⚓</a>until he stands before the congregation for judgment, <i>and</i> until the death of the one who is high priest in those days. Then the slayer may return and come to his own city and his own house, to the city from which he fled.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_20_7"> <sup>7</sup>So they appointed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 21:32; 1 Chr. 6:76">⚓</a>Kedesh in Galilee, in the mountains of Naphtali, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 21:21; 2 Chr. 10:1">⚓</a>Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 14:15; 21:11, 13">⚓</a>Kirjath Arba (which <i>is</i> Hebron) in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:39">⚓</a>the mountains of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse gios_20_8"><sup>8</sup>And on the other side of the Jordan, by Jericho eastward, they assigned <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:43; Josh. 21:36; 1 Chr. 6:78">⚓</a>Bezer in the wilderness on the plain, from the tribe of Reuben, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 21:38; 1 Kin. 22:3">⚓</a>Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 21:27">⚓</a>Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Manasseh. </span>
<span class="verse gios_20_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:15">⚓</a>These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel and for the stranger who dwelt among them, that whoever killed a person accidentally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 20:6">⚓</a>until he stood before the congregation.<br/></span>
