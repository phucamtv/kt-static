<div class="title"><h1>24</h1><h3>The Covenant at Shechem</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_24_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:4">⚓</a>Shechem and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 23:2">⚓</a>called for the elders of Israel, for their heads, for their judges, and for their officers; and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:19">⚓</a>presented themselves before God. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_2"><sup>2</sup>And Joshua said to all the people, “Thus says the Lord God of Israel: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 11:7–32">⚓</a>‘Your fathers, <i>including</i> Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, dwelt on the other side of the River in old times; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:14">⚓</a>they served other gods. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:1; Acts 7:2, 3">⚓</a>Then I took your father Abraham from the other side of the River, led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:1–8; (Ps. 127:3)">⚓</a>gave him Isaac. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_4"><sup>4</sup>To Isaac I gave <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:24–26">⚓</a>Jacob and Esau. To <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 36:8; Deut. 2:5">⚓</a>Esau I gave the mountains of Seir to possess, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:1, 3, 6">⚓</a>but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:10">⚓</a>Also I sent Moses and Aaron, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7—10">⚓</a>I plagued Egypt, according to what I did among them. Afterward I brought you out.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_24_6"> <sup>6</sup>‘Then I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:37, 51; 14:2–31">⚓</a>brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_7"><sup>7</sup>So they cried out to the Lord; and He put <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:20">⚓</a>darkness between you and the Egyptians, brought the sea upon them, and covered them. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:34">⚓</a>your eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Then you dwelt in the wilderness <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:6">⚓</a>a long time. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_8"><sup>8</sup>And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:21–35">⚓</a>and they fought with you. But I gave them into your hand, that you might possess their land, and I destroyed them from before you. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_9"><sup>9</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:25">⚓</a>Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose to make war against Israel, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:2–14">⚓</a>sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 23:5">⚓</a>But I would not listen to Balaam; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:11, 20; 24:10">⚓</a>therefore he continued to bless you. So I delivered you out of his hand. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_11"><sup>11</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:14, 17">⚓</a>you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 6:1; 10:1">⚓</a>the men of Jericho fought against you—<i>also</i> the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I delivered them into your hand. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:28; Deut. 7:20">⚓</a>I sent the hornet before you which drove them out from before you, <i>also</i> the two kings of the Amorites, <i>but</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 44:3">⚓</a>not with your sword or with your bow. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_13"><sup>13</sup>I have given you a land for which you did not labor, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:10, 11">⚓</a>cities which you did not build, and you dwell in them; you eat of the vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_24_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 10:12, 13; 1 Sam. 12:24">⚓</a>“Now therefore, fear the Lord, serve Him in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 1:12">⚓</a>sincerity and in truth, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:2, 23; Ezek. 20:18">⚓</a>put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the River and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 20:7, 8">⚓</a>in Egypt. Serve the Lord! </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_15"><sup>15</sup>And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:15; 1 Kin. 18:21">⚓</a>choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:2; Ezek. 20:39">⚓</a>the gods which your fathers served that <i>were</i> on the other side of the River, or <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:24, 32">⚓</a>the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:19; Ps. 101:2; (1 Tim. 3:4, 5)">⚓</a>But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_24_16"> <sup>16</sup>So the people answered and said: “Far be it from us that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods; </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_17"><sup>17</sup>for the Lord our God <i>is</i> He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way that we went and among all the people through whom we passed. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_18"><sup>18</sup>And the Lord drove out from before us all the people, including the Amorites who dwelt in the land. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 116:16">⚓</a>We also will serve the Lord, for He <i>is</i> our God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_24_19"> <sup>19</sup>But Joshua said to the people, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 6:24">⚓</a>“You cannot serve the Lord, for He <i>is</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:44, 45; 1 Sam. 6:20">⚓</a>holy God. He <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:5">⚓</a>a jealous God; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:21">⚓</a>He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 28:9; Ezra 8:22; Is. 1:28; 63:10; 65:11, 12; Jer. 17:13">⚓</a>If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:24–26; Josh. 23:15">⚓</a>then He will turn and do you harm and consume you, after He has done you good.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_24_21"> <sup>21</sup>And the people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve the Lord!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_24_22"> <sup>22</sup>So Joshua said to the people, “You <i>are</i> witnesses against yourselves that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 119:173">⚓</a>you have chosen the Lord for yourselves, to serve Him.”<br/> And they said, “<i>We</i> <i>are</i> witnesses!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_24_23"> <sup>23</sup>“Now therefore,” <i>he</i> <i>said,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:2; Josh. 24:14; Judg. 10:15, 16; 1 Sam. 7:3">⚓</a>“put away the foreign gods which <i>are</i> among you, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:57, 58; Ps. 119:36; 141:4">⚓</a>incline your heart to the Lord God of Israel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_24_24"> <sup>24</sup>And the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:8; 24:3, 7; Deut. 5:24–27">⚓</a>said to Joshua, “The Lord our God we will serve, and His voice we will obey!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_24_25"> <sup>25</sup>So Joshua <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:25">⚓</a>made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:1">⚓</a>in Shechem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_24_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then Joshua <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:24">⚓</a>wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. And he took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:6">⚓</a>a large stone, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:18">⚓</a>set it up there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:4">⚓</a>under the oak that <i>was</i> by the sanctuary of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_27"><sup>27</sup>And Joshua said to all the people, “Behold, this stone shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:48">⚓</a>a witness to us, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:1">⚓</a>it has heard all the words of the Lord which He spoke to us. It shall therefore be a witness to you, lest you deny your God.” </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_28"><sup>28</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:6, 7">⚓</a>Joshua let the people depart, each to his own inheritance.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Joshua and Eleazar</h3></div>
<span class="verse gios_24_29"> <sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:8">⚓</a>Now it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, <i>being</i> one hundred and ten years old. </span>
<span class="verse gios_24_30"><sup>30</sup>And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:50; Judg. 2:9">⚓</a>Timnath Serah, which <i>is</i> in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_24_31"> <sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:7">⚓</a>Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 11:2">⚓</a>known all the works of the Lord which He had done for Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_24_32"> <sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:25; Ex. 13:19; Heb. 11:22">⚓</a>The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried at Shechem, in the plot of ground <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:19; John 4:5">⚓</a>which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of silver, and which had become an inheritance of the children of Joseph.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gios_24_33"> <sup>33</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 28:1; Num. 20:28; Josh. 14:1">⚓</a>Eleazar the son of Aaron died.
