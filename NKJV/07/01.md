<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>The Continuing Conquest of Canaan</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now after the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:29">⚓</a>death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:21; Judg. 20:18">⚓</a>asked the Lord, saying, “Who shall be first to go up for us against the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 17:12, 13">⚓</a>Canaanites to fight against them?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_1_2"> <sup>2</sup>And the Lord said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:8, 9; Rev. 5:5">⚓</a>“Judah shall go up. Indeed I have delivered the land into his hand.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_1_3"> <sup>3</sup>So Judah said to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:1">⚓</a>Simeon his brother, “Come up with me to my allotted territory, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:17">⚓</a>I will likewise go with you to your allotted territory.” And Simeon went with him. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_4"><sup>4</sup>Then Judah went up, and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they killed ten thousand men at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 11:8">⚓</a>Bezek. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_5"><sup>5</sup>And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_6"><sup>6</sup>Then Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_7"><sup>7</sup>And Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather <i>scraps</i> under my table; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 24:19; 1 Sam. 15:33; (James 2:13)">⚓</a>as I have done, so God has repaid me.” Then they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_1_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:63; Judg. 1:21">⚓</a>the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it; they struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:36; 11:21; 15:13">⚓</a>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the mountains, in the South, and in the lowland. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_10"><sup>10</sup>Then Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:13–19">⚓</a>Hebron. (Now the name of Hebron <i>was</i> formerly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 14:15">⚓</a>Kirjath Arba.) And they killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_1_11"> <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:15">⚓</a>From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir <i>was</i> formerly Kirjath Sepher.)<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_1_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:16, 17">⚓</a>Then Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_13"><sup>13</sup>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:9">⚓</a>Caleb’s younger brother, took it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:18, 19">⚓</a>Now it happened, when she came <i>to</i> <i>him,</i> that she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from <i>her</i> donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you wish?” </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_15"><sup>15</sup>So she said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:11">⚓</a>“Give me a blessing; since you have given me land in the South, give me also springs of water.”<br/> And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_1_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 10:29–32; Judg. 4:11, 17; 1 Sam. 15:6; 1 Chr. 2:55">⚓</a>Now the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 34:3; Judg. 3:13">⚓</a>from the City of Palms with the children of Judah into the Wilderness of Judah, which <i>lies</i> in the South <i>near</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 12:14">⚓</a>Arad; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:6">⚓</a>and they went and dwelt among the people. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:3">⚓</a>And Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they attacked the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:3; Josh. 19:4">⚓</a>Hormah. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_18"><sup>18</sup>Also Judah took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 11:22">⚓</a>Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_19"><sup>19</sup>So the Lord was with Judah. And they drove out the mountaineers, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the lowland, because they had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 17:16, 18; Judg. 4:3, 13">⚓</a>chariots of iron. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:24; Josh. 14:9, 14">⚓</a>And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said. Then he expelled from there the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:14; Judg. 1:10">⚓</a>three sons of Anak. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:63; Judg. 1:8">⚓</a>But the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; so the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_1_22"> <sup>22</sup>And the house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:19">⚓</a>and the Lord<i>was</i> with them. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_23"><sup>23</sup>So the house of Joseph <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:1; 7:2">⚓</a>sent men to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city <i>was</i> formerly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:19">⚓</a>Luz.) </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_24"><sup>24</sup>And when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, “Please show us the entrance to the city, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:12, 14">⚓</a>we will show you mercy.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_25"><sup>25</sup>So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_26"><sup>26</sup>And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which <i>is</i> its name to this day.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Incomplete Conquest of the Land</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_1_27"> <sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 17:11–13">⚓</a>However, Manasseh did not drive out <i>the</i> <i>inhabitants</i> <i>of</i> Beth Shean and its villages, or <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 21:25">⚓</a>Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 17:11">⚓</a>Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_28"><sup>28</sup>And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites under tribute, but did not completely drive them out.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_1_29"> <sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:10; 1 Kin. 9:16">⚓</a>Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; so the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_1_30"> <sup>30</sup>Nor did <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:10–16">⚓</a>Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol; so the Canaanites dwelt among them, and were put under tribute.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_1_31"> <sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:24–31">⚓</a>Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob. </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_32"><sup>32</sup>So the Asherites <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 106:34, 35">⚓</a>dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_1_33"> <sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:32–39">⚓</a>Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but they dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were put under tribute to them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_1_34"> <sup>34</sup>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley; </span>
<span class="verse cac_1_35"><sup>35</sup>and the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:42">⚓</a>in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; yet when the strength of the house of Joseph became greater, they were put under tribute.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_1_36"> <sup>36</sup>Now the boundary of the Amorites <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 34:4; Josh. 15:3">⚓</a>from the Ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela, and upward.<br/></span>
