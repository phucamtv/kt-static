<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Israel’s Disobedience</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the Angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:2; Judg. 6:8, 9">⚓</a>“I led you up from Egypt and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:8">⚓</a>brought you to the land of which I swore to your fathers; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:7, 8; Lev. 26:42, 44; Deut. 7:9; Ps. 89:34">⚓</a>I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you. </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_2"><sup>2</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:32; Deut. 7:2">⚓</a>you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:12, 13; Deut. 12:3">⚓</a>you shall tear down their altars.’ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 106:34">⚓</a>But you have not obeyed My voice. Why have you done this? </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_3"><sup>3</sup>Therefore I also said, ‘I will not drive them out before you; but they shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:55; Josh. 23:13">⚓</a><i>thorns</i> in your side, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:6">⚓</a>their gods shall be a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:33; Deut. 7:16; Ps. 106:36">⚓</a>snare to you.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_4"><sup>4</sup>So it was, when the Angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voices and wept.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_6"><sup>6</sup>And when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 22:6; 24:28–31">⚓</a>Joshua had dismissed the people, the children of Israel went each to his own inheritance to possess the land.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Joshua</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_2_7"> <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:31">⚓</a>So the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the Lord which He had done for Israel. </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_8"><sup>8</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:29">⚓</a>Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died <i>when</i> <i>he</i> <i>was</i> one hundred and ten years old. </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:30">⚓</a>And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:49, 50">⚓</a>Timnath Heres, in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash. </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_10"><sup>10</sup>When all that generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 5:2; 1 Sam. 2:12; Gal. 4:8; (Titus 1:16)">⚓</a>did not know the Lord nor the work which He had done for Israel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel’s Unfaithfulness</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_2_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then the children of Israel did <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:7, 12; 4:1; 6:1">⚓</a>evil in the sight of the Lord, and served the Baals; </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_12"><sup>12</sup>and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:16; Judg. 8:33; 10:6">⚓</a>forsook the Lord God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; and they followed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:14">⚓</a>other gods from <i>among</i> the gods of the people who <i>were</i> all around them, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:5">⚓</a>bowed down to them; and they provoked the Lord to anger. </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_13"><sup>13</sup>They forsook the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:6; Ps. 106:36">⚓</a>and served Baal and the Ashtoreths. </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:17; Judg. 3:8; Ps. 106:40–42">⚓</a>And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel. So He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:20">⚓</a>delivered them into the hands of plunderers who despoiled them; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 50:1">⚓</a>He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:37; Josh. 7:12, 13">⚓</a>could no longer stand before their enemies. </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_15"><sup>15</sup>Wherever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for calamity, as the Lord had said, and as the Lord had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:14–26; Deut. 28:15–68">⚓</a>sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_2_16"> <sup>16</sup>Nevertheless, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:9, 10, 15; Ps. 106:43–45">⚓</a>the Lord raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them. </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_17"><sup>17</sup>Yet they would not listen to their judges, but they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:15">⚓</a>played the harlot with other gods, and bowed down to them. They turned quickly from the way in which their fathers walked, in obeying the commandments of the Lord; they did not do so. </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_18"><sup>18</sup>And when the Lord raised up judges for them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:5">⚓</a>the Lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 6:6">⚓</a>for the Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed them and harassed them. </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_19"><sup>19</sup>And it came to pass, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:12">⚓</a>when the judge was dead, that they reverted and behaved more corruptly than their fathers, by following other gods, to serve them and bow down to them. They did not cease from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_2_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and He said, “Because this nation has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Josh. 23:16)">⚓</a>transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not heeded My voice, </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_21"><sup>21</sup>I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 23:4, 5, 13">⚓</a>left when he died, </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_22"><sup>22</sup>so <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:1, 4">⚓</a>that through them I may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:2, 16; 13:3">⚓</a>test Israel, whether they will keep the ways of the Lord, to walk in them as their fathers kept <i>them,</i> or not.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_2_23"><sup>23</sup>Therefore the Lord left those nations, without driving them out immediately; nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua.<br/></span>
