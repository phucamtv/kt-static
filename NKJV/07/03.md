<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>The Nations Remaining in the Land</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now these <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:1; 2:21, 22">⚓</a>the nations which the Lord left, that He might test Israel by them, <i>that</i> <i>is,</i> all who had not known any of the wars in Canaan </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_2"><sup>2</sup>(<i>this</i> <i>was</i> only so that the generations of the children of Israel might be taught to know war, at least those who had not formerly known it), </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_3"><sup>3</sup><i>namely,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 13:3">⚓</a>five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who dwelt in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_4"><sup>4</sup>And they were <i>left, that He might</i> test Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of the Lord, which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_3_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 106:35">⚓</a>Thus the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_6"><sup>6</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:15, 16; Deut. 7:3, 4; Josh. 23:12">⚓</a>they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons; and they served their gods.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Othniel</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_3_7"> <sup>7</sup>So the children of Israel did <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:11">⚓</a>evil in the sight of the Lord. They <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:18">⚓</a>forgot the Lord their God, and served the Baals and Asherahs. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_8"><sup>8</sup>Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:30; Judg. 2:14">⚓</a>sold them into the hand of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hab. 3:7">⚓</a>Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_9"><sup>9</sup>When the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:15">⚓</a>cried out to the Lord, the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:16">⚓</a>raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel, who delivered them: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:13">⚓</a>Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:18; 1 Sam. 11:6; 2 Chr. 15:1">⚓</a>The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the Lord delivered Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cushan-Rishathaim. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_11"><sup>11</sup>So the land had rest for forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ehud</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_3_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:19">⚓</a>And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord. So the Lord strengthened <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:9">⚓</a>Eglon king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_13"><sup>13</sup>Then he gathered to himself the people of Ammon and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:14">⚓</a>Amalek, went and defeated Israel, and took possession of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 34:3; Judg. 1:16; 2 Chr. 28:15">⚓</a>the City of Palms. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_14"><sup>14</sup>So the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:48">⚓</a>served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_3_15"> <sup>15</sup>But when the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:34">⚓</a>cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:16">⚓</a>left-handed man. By him the children of Israel sent tribute to Eglon king of Moab. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_16"><sup>16</sup>Now Ehud made himself a dagger (it was double-edged and a cubit in length) and fastened it under his clothes on his right thigh. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_17"><sup>17</sup>So he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. (Now Eglon <i>was</i> a very fat man.) </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_18"><sup>18</sup>And when he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried the tribute. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_19"><sup>19</sup>But he himself turned back <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 4:20">⚓</a>from the stone images that <i>were</i> at Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.”<br/> He said, “Keep silence!” And all who attended him went out from him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_3_20"> <sup>20</sup>So Ehud came to him (now he was sitting upstairs in his cool private chamber). Then Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” So he arose from <i>his</i> seat. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_21"><sup>21</sup>Then Ehud reached with his left hand, took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_22"><sup>22</sup>Even the hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the dagger out of his belly; and his entrails came out. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_23"><sup>23</sup>Then Ehud went out through the porch and shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_3_24"> <sup>24</sup>When he had gone out, <i>Eglon’s</i> servants came to look, and <i>to</i> <i>their</i> surprise, the doors of the upper room were locked. So they said, “He is probably <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:3">⚓</a>attending to his needs in the cool chamber.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_25"><sup>25</sup>So they waited till they were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:17; 8:11">⚓</a>embarrassed, and still he had not opened the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened <i>them.</i> And there was their master, fallen dead on the floor.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_3_26"> <sup>26</sup>But Ehud had escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the stone images and escaped to Seirah. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_27"><sup>27</sup>And it happened, when he arrived, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:34; 1 Sam. 13:3">⚓</a>he blew the trumpet in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 17:15">⚓</a>mountains of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mountains; and he led them. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_28"><sup>28</sup>Then he said to them, “Follow <i>me,</i> for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:9, 15; 1 Sam. 17:47">⚓</a>the Lord has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” So they went down after him, seized the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:7; Judg. 12:5">⚓</a>fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross over. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_29"><sup>29</sup>And at that time they killed about ten thousand men of Moab, all stout men of valor; not a man escaped. </span>
<span class="verse cac_3_30"><sup>30</sup>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:11">⚓</a>the land had rest for eighty years.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Shamgar</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_3_31"> <sup>31</sup>After him was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:6">⚓</a>Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed six hundred men of the Philistines <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:47">⚓</a>with an ox goad; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:16">⚓</a>and he also delivered <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 4:1">⚓</a>Israel.<br/></span>
