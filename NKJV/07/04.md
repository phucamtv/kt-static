<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Deborah</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>When Ehud was dead, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:19">⚓</a>the children of Israel again did <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:11">⚓</a>evil in the sight of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse cac_4_2"><sup>2</sup>So the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:14">⚓</a>sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 11:1, 10">⚓</a>Hazor. The commander of his army <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:9; Ps. 83:9">⚓</a>Sisera, who dwelt in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 4:13, 16">⚓</a>Harosheth Hagoyim. </span>
<span class="verse cac_4_3"><sup>3</sup>And the children of Israel cried out to the Lord; for Jabin had nine hundred <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:1; Judg. 1:19">⚓</a>chariots of iron, and for twenty years <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 106:42">⚓</a>he had harshly oppressed the children of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_4_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, was judging Israel at that time. </span>
<span class="verse cac_4_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:8">⚓</a>And she would sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. And the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. </span>
<span class="verse cac_4_6"><sup>6</sup>Then she sent and called for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 11:32">⚓</a>Barak the son of Abinoam from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:37; 21:32">⚓</a>Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, “Has not the Lord God of Israel commanded, ‘Go and deploy <i>troops</i> at Mount <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:18">⚓</a>Tabor; take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun; </span>
<span class="verse cac_4_7"><sup>7</sup>and against you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:4">⚓</a>I will deploy Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude at the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:21; 1 Kin. 18:40; Ps. 83:9, 10">⚓</a>River Kishon; and I will deliver him into your hand’?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_4_8"> <sup>8</sup>And Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_4_9"> <sup>9</sup>So she said, “I will surely go with you; nevertheless there will be no glory for you in the journey you are taking, for the Lord will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:14">⚓</a>sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.” Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh. </span>
<span class="verse cac_4_10"><sup>10</sup>And Barak called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:18">⚓</a>Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; he went up with ten thousand men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 11:8; 1 Kin. 20:10">⚓</a>under his command, and Deborah went up with him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_4_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now Heber <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:16">⚓</a>the Kenite, of the children of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 10:29">⚓</a>Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the terebinth tree at Zaanaim, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 4:6">⚓</a>which <i>is</i> beside Kedesh.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_4_12"> <sup>12</sup>And they reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor. </span>
<span class="verse cac_4_13"><sup>13</sup>So Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who <i>were</i> with him, from Harosheth Hagoyim to the River Kishon.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_4_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then Deborah said to Barak, “Up! For this <i>is</i> the day in which the Lord has delivered Sisera into your hand. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:3; 31:3; 2 Sam. 5:24; Ps. 68:7; Is. 52:12">⚓</a>Has not the Lord gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him. </span>
<span class="verse cac_4_15"><sup>15</sup>And the Lord routed Sisera and all <i>his</i> chariots and all <i>his</i> army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from <i>his</i> chariot and fled away on foot. </span>
<span class="verse cac_4_16"><sup>16</sup>But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:28; Ps. 83:9">⚓</a>left.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_4_17"> <sup>17</sup>However, Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:6">⚓</a>Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for <i>there</i> <i>was</i> peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. </span>
<span class="verse cac_4_18"><sup>18</sup>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; do not fear.” And when he had turned aside with her into the tent, she covered him with a blanket.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_4_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then he said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:24–27">⚓</a>a jug of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him. </span>
<span class="verse cac_4_20"><sup>20</sup>And he said to her, “Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_4_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Jael, Heber’s wife, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:24–27">⚓</a>took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went down into the ground; for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died. </span>
<span class="verse cac_4_22"><sup>22</sup>And then, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, I will show you the man whom you seek.” And when he went into her <i>tent,</i> there lay Sisera, dead with the peg in his temple.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_4_23"> <sup>23</sup>So on that day God subdued Jabin king of Canaan in the presence of the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse cac_4_24"><sup>24</sup>And the hand of the children of Israel grew stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.<br/></span>
