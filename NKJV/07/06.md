<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Midianites Oppress Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the children of Israel did <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:11">⚓</a>evil in the sight of the Lord. So the Lord delivered them into the hand of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:4; 31:1–3">⚓</a>Midian for seven years, </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_2"><sup>2</sup>and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made for themselves the dens, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:6; Heb. 11:38">⚓</a>the caves, and the strongholds which <i>are</i> in the mountains. </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_3"><sup>3</sup>So it was, whenever Israel had sown, Midianites would come up; also Amalekites and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:12">⚓</a>people of the East would come up against them. </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_4"><sup>4</sup>Then they would encamp against them and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:16">⚓</a>destroy the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep nor ox nor <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:31">⚓</a>donkey. </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_5"><sup>5</sup>For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, coming in as numerous as locusts; both they and their camels were without number; and they would enter the land to destroy it. </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_6"><sup>6</sup>So Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 50:15; Hos. 5:15">⚓</a>cried out to the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_7"> <sup>7</sup>And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried out to the Lord because of the Midianites, </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_8"><sup>8</sup>that the Lord sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, “Thus says the Lord God of Israel: ‘I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:17">⚓</a>house of bondage; </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_9"><sup>9</sup>and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 44:2, 3">⚓</a>drove them out before you and gave you their land. </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_10"><sup>10</sup>Also I said to you, “I <i>am</i> the Lord your God; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:35, 37, 38; Jer. 10:2">⚓</a>do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.” But you have not obeyed My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:1, 2">⚓</a>voice.’ ”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Gideon</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_6_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth tree which <i>was</i> in Ophrah, which <i>belonged</i> to Joash <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 17:2; Judg. 6:15">⚓</a>the Abiezrite, while his son <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:1; Heb. 11:32">⚓</a>Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide <i>it</i> from the Midianites. </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_12"><sup>12</sup>And the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 13:3; Luke 1:11, 28">⚓</a>Angel of the Lord appeared to him, and said to him, “The Lord<i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:5">⚓</a>with you, you mighty man of valor!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_13"> <sup>13</sup>Gideon said to Him, “O my lord, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 59:1)">⚓</a>where <i>are</i> all His miracles <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 4:6, 21; Ps. 44:1">⚓</a>which our fathers told us about, saying, ‘Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the Lord has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:17; 2 Chr. 15:2; Ps. 44:9–16">⚓</a>forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then the Lord turned to him and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:11">⚓</a>“Go in this might of yours, and you shall save Israel from the hand of the Midianites. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:9">⚓</a>Have I not sent you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_15"> <sup>15</sup>So he said to Him, “O my Lord, how can I save Israel? Indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:21">⚓</a>my clan <i>is</i> the weakest in Manasseh, and I <i>am</i> the least in my father’s house.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_16"> <sup>16</sup>And the Lord said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:12; Josh. 1:5">⚓</a>“Surely I will be with you, and you shall defeat the Midianites as one man.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then he said to Him, “If now I have found favor in Your sight, then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:36, 37; 2 Kin. 20:8; Ps. 86:17; Is. 7:11; 38:7, 8">⚓</a>show me a sign that it is You who talk with me. </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:3, 5">⚓</a>Do not depart from here, I pray, until I come to You and bring out my offering and set <i>it</i> before You.”<br/> And He said, “I will wait until you come back.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_19"> <sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:6–8">⚓</a>So Gideon went in and prepared a young goat, and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot; and he brought <i>them</i> out to Him under the terebinth tree and presented <i>them.</i></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_20"><sup>20</sup>The Angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 13:19">⚓</a>lay <i>them</i> on this rock, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:33, 34">⚓</a>pour out the broth.” And he did so.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then the Angel of the Lord put out the end of the staff that <i>was</i> in His hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened bread; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 9:24">⚓</a>fire rose out of the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. And the Angel of the Lord departed out of his sight.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_22"> <sup>22</sup>Now Gideon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:30; Ex. 33:20; Judg. 13:21, 22">⚓</a>perceived that He <i>was</i> the Angel of the Lord. So Gideon said, “Alas, O Lord God! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:13">⚓</a>For I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then the Lord said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:19">⚓</a>“Peace <i>be</i> with you; do not fear, you shall not die.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_24"><sup>24</sup>So Gideon built an altar there to the Lord, and called it The-Lord-<i>Is</i>-Peace. To this day it <i>is</i> still <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:32">⚓</a>in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now it came to pass the same night that the Lord said to him, “Take your father’s young bull, the second bull of seven years old, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:2">⚓</a>tear down the altar of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:7">⚓</a>Baal that your father has, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:13; Deut. 7:5">⚓</a>cut down the wooden image that <i>is</i> beside it; </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_26"><sup>26</sup>and build an altar to the Lord your God on top of this rock in the proper arrangement, and take the second bull and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the image which you shall cut down.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_27"><sup>27</sup>So Gideon took ten men from among his servants and did as the Lord had said to him. But because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city too much to do <i>it</i> by day, he did <i>it</i> by night.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Gideon Destroys the Altar of Baal</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_6_28"> <sup>28</sup>And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, there was the altar of Baal, torn down; and the wooden image that <i>was</i> beside it was cut down, and the second bull was being offered on the altar <i>which</i> <i>had</i> <i>been</i> built. </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_29"><sup>29</sup>So they said to one another, “Who has done this thing?” And when they had inquired and asked, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_30"><sup>30</sup>Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has torn down the altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the wooden image that <i>was</i> beside it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_31"> <sup>31</sup>But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Would you plead for Baal? Would you save him? Let the one who would plead for him be put to death by morning! If he <i>is</i> a god, let him plead for himself, because his altar has been torn down!” </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_32"><sup>32</sup>Therefore on that day he called him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:1; 1 Sam. 12:11; 2 Sam. 11:21">⚓</a>Jerubbaal, saying, “Let Baal plead against him, because he has torn down his altar.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_6_33"> <sup>33</sup>Then all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:3">⚓</a>the Midianites and Amalekites, the people of the East, gathered together; and they crossed over and encamped in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 17:16; Hos. 1:5">⚓</a>the Valley of Jezreel. </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_34"><sup>34</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:10; 1 Chr. 12:18; 2 Chr. 24:20">⚓</a>the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon; then he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 10:3; Judg. 3:27">⚓</a>blew the trumpet, and the Abiezrites gathered behind him. </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_35"><sup>35</sup>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, who also gathered behind him. He also sent messengers to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:17; 7:23">⚓</a>Asher, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 4:6, 10; 5:18">⚓</a>Zebulun, and Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Sign of the Fleece</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_6_36"> <sup>36</sup>So Gideon said to God, “If You will save Israel by my hand as You have said— </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_37"><sup>37</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 4:3–7)">⚓</a>look, I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece only, and <i>it</i> <i>is</i> dry on all the ground, then I shall know that You will save Israel by my hand, as You have said.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_38"><sup>38</sup>And it was so. When he rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece together, he wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water. </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_39"><sup>39</sup>Then Gideon said to God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:32">⚓</a>“Do not be angry with me, but let me speak just once more: Let me test, I pray, just once more with the fleece; let it now be dry only on the fleece, but on all the ground let there be dew.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_6_40"><sup>40</sup>And God did so that night. It was dry on the fleece only, but there was dew on all the ground.<br/></span>
