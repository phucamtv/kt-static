<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>Gideon Subdues the Midianites</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 12:1; 2 Sam. 19:41">⚓</a>the men of Ephraim said to him, “Why have you done this to us by not calling us when you went to fight with the Midianites?” And they reprimanded him sharply.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_8_2"> <sup>2</sup>So he said to them, “What have I done now in comparison with you? <i>Is</i> not the gleaning <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>grapes</i> of Ephraim better than the vintage of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:11">⚓</a>Abiezer? </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:24, 25">⚓</a>God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And what was I able to do in comparison with you?” Then their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 15:1">⚓</a>anger toward him subsided when he said that.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_8_4"> <sup>4</sup>When Gideon came <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:25">⚓</a>to the Jordan, he and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:6">⚓</a>the three hundred men who <i>were</i> with him crossed over, exhausted but still in pursuit. </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_5"><sup>5</sup>Then he said to the men of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:17; Ps. 60:6">⚓</a>Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_8_6"> <sup>6</sup>And the leaders of Succoth said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 20:11; Judg. 8:15">⚓</a>“<i>Are</i> the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:11">⚓</a>we should give bread to your army?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_8_7"> <sup>7</sup>So Gideon said, “For this cause, when the Lord has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:16">⚓</a>then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers!” </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_8"><sup>8</sup>Then he went up from there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:30, 31; 1 Kin. 12:25">⚓</a>to Penuel and spoke to them in the same way. And the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_9"><sup>9</sup>So he also spoke to the men of Penuel, saying, “When I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:27">⚓</a>come back in peace, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:17">⚓</a>I will tear down this tower!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_8_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now Zebah and Zalmunna <i>were</i> at Karkor, and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand, all who were left of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:12">⚓</a>all the army of the people of the East; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:5">⚓</a>one hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword had fallen. </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_11"><sup>11</sup>Then Gideon went up by the road of those who dwell in tents on the east of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:35, 42">⚓</a>Nobah and Jogbehah; and he attacked the army while the camp felt <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 18:27; (1 Thess. 5:3)">⚓</a>secure. </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_12"><sup>12</sup>When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them; and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 83:11">⚓</a>took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and routed the whole army.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_8_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle, from the Ascent of Heres. </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_14"><sup>14</sup>And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth and interrogated him; and he wrote down for him the leaders of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men. </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_15"><sup>15</sup>Then he came to the men of Succoth and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:6">⚓</a>ridiculed me, saying, ‘<i>Are</i> the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your weary men?’ ” </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:7">⚓</a>And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:9">⚓</a>Then he tore down the tower of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:25">⚓</a>Penuel and killed the men of the city.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_8_18"> <sup>18</sup>And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men <i>were</i> <i>they</i> whom you killed at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 4:6; Ps. 89:12">⚓</a>Tabor?”<br/> So they answered, “As you <i>are,</i> so <i>were</i> they; each one resembled the son of a king.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_8_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then he said, “They <i>were</i> my brothers, the sons of my mother. <i>As</i> the Lord lives, if you had let them live, I would not kill you.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_20"><sup>20</sup>And he said to Jether his firstborn, “Rise, kill them!” But the youth would not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he <i>was</i> still a youth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_8_21"> <sup>21</sup>So Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise yourself, and kill us; for as a man <i>is, so is</i> his strength.” So Gideon arose and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 83:11">⚓</a>killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that <i>were</i> on their camels’ necks.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Gideon’s Ephod</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_8_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Judg. 9:8)">⚓</a>“Rule over us, both you and your son, and your grandson also; for you have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:9; 9:17">⚓</a>delivered us from the hand of Midian.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_8_23"> <sup>23</sup>But Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, nor shall my son rule over you; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:7; 10:19; 12:12; Ps. 10:16">⚓</a>the Lord shall rule over you.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_24"><sup>24</sup>Then Gideon said to them, “I would like to make a request of you, that each of you would give me the earrings from his plunder.” For they had golden earrings, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:25, 28">⚓</a>because they <i>were</i> Ishmaelites.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_8_25"> <sup>25</sup>So they answered, “We will gladly give <i>them.</i>” And they spread out a garment, and each man threw into it the earrings from his plunder. </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_26"><sup>26</sup>Now the weight of the gold earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred <i>shekels</i> of gold, besides the crescent ornaments, pendants, and purple robes which <i>were</i> on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that <i>were</i> around their camels’ necks. </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_27"><sup>27</sup>Then Gideon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 17:5">⚓</a>made it into an ephod and set it up in his city, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:11, 24">⚓</a>Ophrah. And all Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 106:39)">⚓</a>played the harlot with it there. It became <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:16">⚓</a>a snare to Gideon and to his house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_8_28"> <sup>28</sup>Thus Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted their heads no more. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:31">⚓</a>And the country was quiet for forty years in the days of Gideon.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Gideon</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_8_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:32; 7:1">⚓</a>Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_30"><sup>30</sup>Gideon had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:2, 5">⚓</a>seventy sons who were his own offspring, for he had many wives. </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_31"><sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:1">⚓</a>And his concubine who <i>was</i> in Shechem also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech. </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_32"><sup>32</sup>Now Gideon the son of Joash died <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:8; Job 5:26">⚓</a>at a good old age, and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:24; 8:27">⚓</a>in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_8_33"> <sup>33</sup>So it was, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:19">⚓</a>as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel again <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:17">⚓</a>played the harlot with the Baals, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:4, 46">⚓</a>and made Baal-Berith their god. </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_34"><sup>34</sup>Thus the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:9; Judg. 3:7; Ps. 78:11, 42; 106:13, 21">⚓</a>did not remember the Lord their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side; </span>
<span class="verse cac_8_35"><sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:16–18">⚓</a>nor did they show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal (Gideon) in accordance with the good he had done for Israel.<br/></span>
