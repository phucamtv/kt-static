<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>Abimelech’s Conspiracy</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:31, 35">⚓</a>his mother’s brothers, and spoke with them and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying, </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_2"><sup>2</sup>“Please speak in the hearing of all the men of Shechem: ‘Which is better for you, that all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:30; 9:5, 18">⚓</a>seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal reign over you, or that one reign over you?’ Remember that I <i>am</i> your own flesh and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:14">⚓</a>bone.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_3"> <sup>3</sup>And his mother’s brothers spoke all these words concerning him in the hearing of all the men of Shechem; and their heart was inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:15">⚓</a>brother.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_4"><sup>4</sup>So they gave him seventy <i>shekels</i> of silver from the temple of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:33">⚓</a>Baal-Berith, with which Abimelech hired <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:3; 2 Chr. 13:7; Acts 17:5">⚓</a>worthless and reckless men; and they followed him. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_5"><sup>5</sup>Then he went to his father’s house <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:24">⚓</a>at Ophrah and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:30; 9:2, 18; 2 Kin. 11:1, 2">⚓</a>killed his brothers, the seventy sons of Jerubbaal, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, because he hid himself. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_6"><sup>6</sup>And all the men of Shechem gathered together, all of Beth Millo, and they went and made Abimelech king beside the terebinth tree at the pillar that <i>was</i> in Shechem.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Trees</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_9_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now when they told Jotham, he went and stood on top of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 11:29; 27:12; Josh. 8:33; John 4:20">⚓</a>Mount Gerizim, and lifted his voice and cried out. And he said to them:<br/>  “Listen to me, you men of Shechem,<br/>   That God may listen to you!<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_8">  <sup>8</sup>“The<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:9">⚓</a> trees once went forth to anoint a king over them.<br/>   And they said to the olive tree,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:22, 23">⚓</a>‘Reign over us!’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_9">   <sup>9</sup>But the olive tree said to them,<br/>   ‘Should I cease giving my oil,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 5:23)">⚓</a>With which they honor God and men,<br/>   And go to sway over trees?’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_10">  <sup>10</sup>“Then the trees said to the fig tree,<br/>   ‘You come <i>and</i> reign over us!’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_11">   <sup>11</sup>But the fig tree said to them,<br/>   ‘Should I cease my sweetness and my good fruit,<br/>   And go to sway over trees?’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_12">  <sup>12</sup>“Then the trees said to the vine,<br/>   ‘You come <i>and</i> reign over us!’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_13">   <sup>13</sup>But the vine said to them,<br/>   ‘Should I cease my new wine,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 104:15">⚓</a>Which cheers <i>both</i> God and men,<br/>   And go to sway over trees?’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_14">  <sup>14</sup>“Then all the trees said to the bramble,<br/>   ‘You come <i>and</i> reign over us!’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_15">   <sup>15</sup>And the bramble said to the trees,<br/>   ‘If in truth you anoint me as king over you,<br/>   <i>Then</i> come <i>and</i> take shelter in my <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 30:2; Dan. 4:12; Hos. 14:7">⚓</a>shade;<br/>   But if not, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:28; Judg. 9:20; Ezek. 19:14">⚓</a>let fire come out of the bramble<br/>   And devour the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:9; Is. 2:13; Ezek. 31:3">⚓</a>cedars of Lebanon!’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_16"> <sup>16</sup>“Now therefore, if you have acted in truth and sincerity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:35">⚓</a>as he deserves— </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_17"><sup>17</sup>for my <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7">⚓</a>father fought for you, risked his life, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:22">⚓</a>delivered you out of the hand of Midian; </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:30, 35; 9:2, 5, 6">⚓</a>but you have risen up against my father’s house this day, and killed his seventy sons on one stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:31">⚓</a>female servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother— </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_19"><sup>19</sup>if then you have acted in truth and sincerity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, <i>then</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 8:6; (Phil. 3:3)">⚓</a>rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_20"><sup>20</sup>“But if not, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:15, 45, 56, 57">⚓</a>let fire come from Abimelech and devour the men of Shechem and Beth Millo; and let fire come from the men of Shechem and from Beth Millo and devour Abimelech!” </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_21"><sup>21</sup>And Jotham ran away and fled; and he went to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:16">⚓</a>Beer and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Downfall of Abimelech</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_9_22"> <sup>22</sup>After Abimelech had reigned over Israel three years, </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:15; Is. 19:14">⚓</a>God sent a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:14; 18:9, 10; 1 Kin. 22:22; 2 Chr. 18:22">⚓</a>spirit of ill will between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 33:1">⚓</a>dealt treacherously with Abimelech, </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:32; Esth. 9:25; Matt. 23:35, 36">⚓</a>that the crime <i>done</i> to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be settled and their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:33">⚓</a>blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who aided him in the killing of his brothers. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_25"><sup>25</sup>And the men of Shechem set men in ambush against him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way; and it was told Abimelech.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_26"> <sup>26</sup>Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_27"><sup>27</sup>So they went out into the fields, and gathered <i>grapes</i> from their vineyards and trod <i>them,</i> and made merry. And they went into <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:4">⚓</a>the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_28"><sup>28</sup>Then Gaal the son of Ebed said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:10; 1 Kin. 12:16">⚓</a>“Who <i>is</i> Abimelech, and who <i>is</i> Shechem, that we should serve him? <i>Is</i> <i>he</i> not the son of Jerubbaal, and <i>is</i> <i>not</i> Zebul his officer? Serve the men of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:2, 6; Josh. 24:32">⚓</a>Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him? </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_29"><sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:4">⚓</a>If only this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelech.” So he said to Abimelech, “Increase your army and come out!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_30"> <sup>30</sup>When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was aroused. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_31"><sup>31</sup>And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, “Take note! Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem; and here they are, fortifying the city against you. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_32"><sup>32</sup>Now therefore, get up by night, you and the people who <i>are</i> with you, and lie in wait in the field. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_33"><sup>33</sup>And it shall be, as soon as the sun is up in the morning, <i>that</i> you shall rise early and rush upon the city; and <i>when</i> he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may then do to them as you find opportunity.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_34"> <sup>34</sup>So Abimelech and all the people who <i>were</i> with him rose by night, and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_35"><sup>35</sup>When Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance to the city gate, Abimelech and the people who <i>were</i> with him rose from lying in wait. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_36"><sup>36</sup>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!”<br/> But Zebul said to him, “You see the shadows of the mountains as <i>if</i> <i>they</i> <i>were</i> men.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_37"> <sup>37</sup>So Gaal spoke again and said, “See, people are coming down from the center of the land, and another company is coming from the Diviners’ Terebinth Tree.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_38"> <sup>38</sup>Then Zebul said to him, “Where indeed <i>is</i> your mouth now, with which you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:28, 29">⚓</a>said, ‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ <i>Are</i> not these the people whom you despised? Go out, if you will, and fight with them now.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_39"> <sup>39</sup>So Gaal went out, leading the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_40"><sup>40</sup>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled from him; and many fell wounded, to the <i>very</i> entrance of the gate. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_41"><sup>41</sup>Then Abimelech dwelt at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, so that they would not dwell in Shechem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_42"> <sup>42</sup>And it came about on the next day that the people went out into the field, and they told Abimelech. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_43"><sup>43</sup>So he took his people, divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the field. And he looked, and there were the people, coming out of the city; and he rose against them and attacked them. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_44"><sup>44</sup>Then Abimelech and the company that <i>was</i> with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city; and the <i>other</i> two companies rushed upon all who <i>were</i> in the fields and killed them. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_45"><sup>45</sup>So Abimelech fought against the city all that day; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:20">⚓</a>he took the city and killed the people who <i>were</i> in it; and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:23; 2 Kin. 3:25">⚓</a>demolished the city and sowed it with salt.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_46"> <sup>46</sup>Now when all the men of the tower of Shechem had heard <i>that,</i> they entered the stronghold of the temple <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:33">⚓</a>of the god Berith. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_47"><sup>47</sup>And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_48"><sup>48</sup>Then Abimelech went up to Mount <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 68:14">⚓</a>Zalmon, he and all the people who <i>were</i> with him. And Abimelech took an ax in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it and laid <i>it</i> on his shoulder; then he said to the people who were with him, “What you have seen me do, make haste <i>and</i> do as I <i>have</i> <i>done.</i>” </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_49"><sup>49</sup>So each of the people likewise cut down his own bough and followed Abimelech, put <i>them</i> against the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire above them, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_50"> <sup>50</sup>Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and he encamped against Thebez and took it. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_51"><sup>51</sup>But there was a strong tower in the city, and all the men and women—all the people of the city—fled there and shut themselves in; then they went up to the top of the tower. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_52"><sup>52</sup>So Abimelech came as far as the tower and fought against it; and he drew near the door of the tower to burn it with fire. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_53"><sup>53</sup>But a certain woman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 11:21">⚓</a>dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_54"><sup>54</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:4">⚓</a>he called quickly to the young man, his armorbearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, lest men say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ ” So his young man thrust him through, and he died. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_55"><sup>55</sup>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed, every man to his place.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_9_56"> <sup>56</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:24; Job 31:3; Prov. 5:22">⚓</a>Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers. </span>
<span class="verse cac_9_57"><sup>57</sup>And all the evil of the men of Shechem God returned on their own heads, and on them came <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:20">⚓</a>the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.<br/></span>
