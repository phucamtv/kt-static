<span class="verse cac_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>After Abimelech there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:16">⚓</a>arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the mountains of Ephraim. </span>
<span class="verse cac_10_2"><sup>2</sup>He judged Israel twenty-three years; and he died and was buried in Shamir.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jair</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_10_3"> <sup>3</sup>After him arose Jair, a Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty-two years. </span>
<span class="verse cac_10_4"><sup>4</sup>Now he had thirty sons who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:10; 12:14">⚓</a>rode on thirty donkeys; they also had thirty towns, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:14">⚓</a>which are called “Havoth Jair” to this day, which <i>are</i> in the land of Gilead. </span>
<span class="verse cac_10_5"><sup>5</sup>And Jair died and was buried in Camon.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel Oppressed Again</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_10_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:11; 3:7; 6:1; 13:1">⚓</a>the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:13">⚓</a>served the Baals and the Ashtoreths, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:12">⚓</a>the gods of Syria, the gods of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:33; Ps. 106:36">⚓</a>Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the people of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; and they forsook the Lord and did not serve Him. </span>
<span class="verse cac_10_7"><sup>7</sup>So the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:14; 4:2; 1 Sam. 12:9">⚓</a>sold them into the hands of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 13:1">⚓</a>Philistines and into the hands of the people of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:13">⚓</a>Ammon. </span>
<span class="verse cac_10_8"><sup>8</sup>From that year they harassed and oppressed the children of Israel for eighteen years—all the children of Israel who <i>were</i> on the other side of the Jordan in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:33">⚓</a>land of the Amorites, in Gilead. </span>
<span class="verse cac_10_9"><sup>9</sup>Moreover the people of Ammon crossed over the Jordan to fight against Judah also, against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was severely distressed.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_10_10"> <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:6; 1 Sam. 12:10">⚓</a>And the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, saying, “We have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:41">⚓</a>sinned against You, because we have both forsaken our God and served the Baals!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_10_11"> <sup>11</sup>So the Lord said to the children of Israel, “<i>Did</i> <i>I</i> not <i>deliver</i> <i>you</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:30">⚓</a>from the Egyptians and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:21, 24, 25">⚓</a>from the Amorites and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:12, 13">⚓</a>from the people of Ammon and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:31">⚓</a>from the Philistines? </span>
<span class="verse cac_10_12"><sup>12</sup>Also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:31; 5:19">⚓</a>the Sidonians <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:3; 7:12">⚓</a>and Amalekites and Maonites <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 106:42, 43">⚓</a>oppressed you; and you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hand. </span>
<span class="verse cac_10_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 32:15; Judg. 2:12; Jer. 2:13)">⚓</a>Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods. Therefore I will deliver you no more. </span>
<span class="verse cac_10_14"><sup>14</sup>“Go and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:37, 38">⚓</a>cry out to the gods which you have chosen; let them deliver you in your time of distress.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_10_15"> <sup>15</sup>And the children of Israel said to the Lord, “We have sinned! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:18; 2 Sam. 15:26">⚓</a>Do to us whatever seems best to You; only deliver us this day, we pray.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_10_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 7:14; Jer. 18:7, 8">⚓</a>So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the Lord.

<span class="verse cac_10_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then the people of Ammon gathered together and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled together and encamped in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:49; Judg. 11:11, 29">⚓</a>Mizpah. </span>
<span class="verse cac_10_18"><sup>18</sup>And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said to one another, “Who <i>is</i> the man who will begin the fight against the people of Ammon? He shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:8, 11">⚓</a>be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”<br/></span>
