<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>Jephthah</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 11:32">⚓</a>Jephthah the Gileadite was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:12; 2 Kin. 5:1">⚓</a>a mighty man of valor, but he <i>was</i> the son of a harlot; and Gilead begot Jephthah. </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_2"><sup>2</sup>Gilead’s wife bore sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out, and said to him, “You shall have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:10; Deut. 23:2">⚓</a>no inheritance in our father’s house, for you <i>are</i> the son of another woman.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and dwelt in the land of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 10:6, 8">⚓</a>Tob; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 22:2">⚓</a>worthless men banded together with Jephthah and went out <i>raiding</i> with him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_11_4"> <sup>4</sup>It came to pass after a time that the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:9, 17">⚓</a>people of Ammon made war against Israel. </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_5"><sup>5</sup>And so it was, when the people of Ammon made war against Israel, that the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob. </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_6"><sup>6</sup>Then they said to Jephthah, “Come and be our commander, that we may fight against the people of Ammon.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_11_7"> <sup>7</sup>So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:27">⚓</a>“Did you not hate me, and expel me from my father’s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_11_8"> <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:18">⚓</a>And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “That is why we have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 17:4)">⚓</a>turned again to you now, that you may go with us and fight against the people of Ammon, and be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:18">⚓</a>our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_11_9"> <sup>9</sup>So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you take me back home to fight against the people of Ammon, and the Lord delivers them to me, shall I be your head?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_11_10"> <sup>10</sup>And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:49, 50; Jer. 29:23; 42:5">⚓</a>“The Lord will be a witness between us, if we do not do according to your words.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_11"><sup>11</sup>Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:8">⚓</a>head and commander over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:17; 20:1; 1 Sam. 10:17">⚓</a>before the Lord in Mizpah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_11_12"> <sup>12</sup>Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:10">⚓</a>“What do you have against me, that you have come to fight against me in my land?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_11_13"> <sup>13</sup>And the king of the people of Ammon answered the messengers of Jephthah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:24–26">⚓</a>“Because Israel took away my land when they came up out of Egypt, from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 13:9">⚓</a>the Arnon as far as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:22">⚓</a>the Jabbok, and to the Jordan. Now therefore, restore those <i>lands</i> peaceably.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_11_14"> <sup>14</sup>So Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the people of Ammon, </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_15"><sup>15</sup>and said to him, “Thus says Jephthah: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:9, 19">⚓</a>‘Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the people of Ammon; </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_16"><sup>16</sup>for when Israel came up from Egypt, they walked through the wilderness as far as the Red Sea and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:26; 20:1">⚓</a>came to Kadesh. </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_17"><sup>17</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:14">⚓</a>Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, “Please let me pass through your land.” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:14–21">⚓</a>But the king of Edom would not heed. And in like manner they sent to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:9">⚓</a>king of Moab, but he would not <i>consent.</i> So Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:1">⚓</a>remained in Kadesh. </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_18"><sup>18</sup>And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:9, 18, 19">⚓</a>went along through the wilderness and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:4">⚓</a>bypassed the land of Edom and the land of Moab, came to the east side of the land of Moab, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the border of Moab, for the Arnon <i>was</i> the border of Moab. </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_19"><sup>19</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:21; Deut. 2:26–36">⚓</a>Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, “Please <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:22; Deut. 2:27">⚓</a>let us pass through your land into our place.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:23; Deut. 2:27">⚓</a>But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. So Sihon gathered all his people together, encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_21"><sup>21</sup>And the Lord God of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:8">⚓</a>delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:24, 25">⚓</a>defeated them. Thus Israel gained possession of all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited that country. </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_22"><sup>22</sup>They took possession of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:36, 37">⚓</a>all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_11_23"> <sup>23</sup>‘And now the Lord God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel; should you then possess it? </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_24"><sup>24</sup>Will you not possess whatever <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:29; 1 Kin. 11:7; Jer. 48:7">⚓</a>Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whatever <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 9:4, 5; Josh. 3:10)">⚓</a>the Lord our God takes possession of before us, we will possess. </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_25"><sup>25</sup>And now, <i>are</i> you any better than <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:2; Josh. 24:9; Mic. 6:5">⚓</a>Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel? Did he ever fight against them? </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_26"><sup>26</sup>While Israel dwelt in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:25, 26">⚓</a>Heshbon and its villages, in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:36">⚓</a>Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the banks of the Arnon, for three hundred years, why did you not recover <i>them</i> within that time? </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_27"><sup>27</sup>Therefore I have not sinned against you, but you wronged me by fighting against me. May the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:25">⚓</a>the Judge, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:5; 31:53; (1 Sam. 24:12, 15)">⚓</a>render judgment this day between the children of Israel and the people of Ammon.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_28"><sup>28</sup>However, the king of the people of Ammon did not heed the words which Jephthah sent him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jephthah’s Vow and Victory</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_11_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:10">⚓</a>the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and passed through Mizpah of Gilead; and from Mizpah of Gilead he advanced <i>toward</i> the people of Ammon. </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_30"><sup>30</sup>And Jephthah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:20; Num. 30:2; 1 Sam. 1:11">⚓</a>made a vow to the Lord, and said, “If You will indeed deliver the people of Ammon into my hands, </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_31"><sup>31</sup>then it will be that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the people of Ammon, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 27:2, 3, 28; 1 Sam. 1:11">⚓</a>shall surely be the Lord’s, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 66:13">⚓</a>and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_11_32"> <sup>32</sup>So Jephthah advanced toward the people of Ammon to fight against them, and the Lord delivered them into his hands. </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_33"><sup>33</sup>And he defeated them from Aroer as far as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 27:17">⚓</a>Minnith—twenty cities—and to Abel Keramim, with a very great slaughter. Thus the people of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jephthah’s Daughter</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_11_34"> <sup>34</sup>When Jephthah came to his house at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:17; 11:11">⚓</a>Mizpah, there was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:20; 1 Sam. 18:6; Ps. 68:25; Jer. 31:4">⚓</a>his daughter, coming out to meet him with timbrels and dancing; and she <i>was</i> <i>his</i> only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter. </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_35"><sup>35</sup>And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:29, 34">⚓</a>tore his clothes, and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low! You are among those who trouble me! For I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 5:2, 4, 5">⚓</a>have given my word to the Lord, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 30:2">⚓</a>I cannot go back on it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_11_36"> <sup>36</sup>So she said to him, “My father, <i>if</i> you have given your word to the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 30:2">⚓</a>do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 18:19, 31">⚓</a>the Lord has avenged you of your enemies, the people of Ammon.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_37"><sup>37</sup>Then she said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me: let me alone for two months, that I may go and wander on the mountains and bewail my virginity, my friends and I.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_11_38"> <sup>38</sup>So he said, “Go.” And he sent her away <i>for</i> two months; and she went with her friends, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains. </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_39"><sup>39</sup>And it was so at the end of two months that she returned to her father, and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:31">⚓</a>carried out his vow with her which he had vowed. She knew no man.<br/> And it became a custom in Israel </span>
<span class="verse cac_11_40"><sup>40</sup><i>that</i> the daughters of Israel went four days each year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.<br/></span>
