<div class="title"><h1>13</h1><h3>The Birth of Samson</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>Again the children of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:11">⚓</a>did evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord delivered them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:7; 1 Sam. 12:9">⚓</a>into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_2"> <sup>2</sup>Now there was a certain man from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:41; Judg. 16:31">⚓</a>Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name <i>was</i> Manoah; and his wife <i>was</i> barren and had no children. </span>
<span class="verse cac_13_3"><sup>3</sup>And the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:12">⚓</a>Angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and said to her, “Indeed now, you are barren and have borne no children, but you shall conceive and bear a son. </span>
<span class="verse cac_13_4"><sup>4</sup>Now therefore, please be careful <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 6:2, 3, 20; Judg. 13:4; Luke 1:15">⚓</a>not to drink wine or <i>similar</i> drink, and not to eat anything unclean. </span>
<span class="verse cac_13_5"><sup>5</sup>For behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. And no <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 6:5; 1 Sam. 1:11">⚓</a>razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 6:2">⚓</a>a Nazirite to God from the womb; and he shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:13; 2 Sam. 8:1; 1 Chr. 18:1">⚓</a>begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_6"> <sup>6</sup>So the woman came and told her husband, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:24–30">⚓</a>“A Man of God came to me, and His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:3; Luke 9:29; Acts 6:15">⚓</a>countenance <i>was</i> like the countenance of the Angel of God, very awesome; but I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 13:17, 18">⚓</a>did not ask Him where He <i>was</i> from, and He did not tell me His name. </span>
<span class="verse cac_13_7"><sup>7</sup>And He said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. Now drink no wine or <i>similar</i> drink, nor eat anything unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Manoah prayed to the Lord, and said, “O my Lord, please let the Man of God whom You sent come to us again and teach us what we shall do for the child who will be born.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_9"> <sup>9</sup>And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the Angel of God came to the woman again as she was sitting in the field; but Manoah her husband <i>was</i> not with her. </span>
<span class="verse cac_13_10"><sup>10</sup>Then the woman ran in haste and told her husband, and said to him, “Look, the Man who came to me the <i>other</i> day has just now appeared to me!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_11"> <sup>11</sup>So Manoah arose and followed his wife. When he came to the Man, he said to Him, “Are You the Man who spoke to this woman?”<br/> And He said, “I <i>am.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_12"> <sup>12</sup>Manoah said, “Now let Your words come <i>to</i> <i>pass!</i> What will be the boy’s rule of life, and his work?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_13"> <sup>13</sup>So the Angel of the Lord said to Manoah, “Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful. </span>
<span class="verse cac_13_14"><sup>14</sup>She may not eat anything that comes from the vine, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 6:3, 4; Judg. 13:4">⚓</a>nor may she drink wine or <i>similar</i> drink, nor eat anything unclean. All that I commanded her let her observe.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then Manoah said to the Angel of the Lord, “Please <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:5; Judg. 6:18">⚓</a>let us detain You, and we will prepare a young goat for You.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_16"> <sup>16</sup>And the Angel of the Lord said to Manoah, “Though you detain Me, I will not eat your food. But if you offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the Lord.” (For Manoah did not know He <i>was</i> the Angel of the Lord.)<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Manoah said to the Angel of the Lord, “What <i>is</i> Your name, that when Your words come <i>to</i> <i>pass</i> we may honor You?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_18"> <sup>18</sup>And the Angel of the Lord said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:29">⚓</a>“Why do you ask My name, seeing it <i>is</i> wonderful?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_19"> <sup>19</sup>So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:19–21">⚓</a>and offered it upon the rock to the Lord. And He did a wondrous thing while Manoah and his wife looked on— </span>
<span class="verse cac_13_20"><sup>20</sup>it happened as the flame went up toward heaven from the altar—the Angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar! When Manoah and his wife saw <i>this,</i> they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 9:24; 1 Chr. 21:16; Ezek. 1:28; Matt. 17:6">⚓</a>fell on their faces to the ground. </span>
<span class="verse cac_13_21"><sup>21</sup>When the Angel of the Lord appeared no more to Manoah and his wife, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:22">⚓</a>then Manoah knew that He <i>was</i> the Angel of the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_22"> <sup>22</sup>And Manoah said to his wife, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:30; Ex. 33:20; Deut. 5:26; Judg. 6:22, 23">⚓</a>“We shall surely die, because we have seen God!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_23"> <sup>23</sup>But his wife said to him, “If the Lord had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these <i>things,</i> nor would He have told us <i>such</i> <i>things</i> as these at this time.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_13_24"> <sup>24</sup>So the woman bore a son and called his name <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 11:32">⚓</a>Samson; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:19; Luke 1:80">⚓</a>the child grew, and the Lord blessed him. </span>
<span class="verse cac_13_25"><sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:10; 1 Sam. 11:6; Matt. 4:1">⚓</a>And the Spirit of the Lord began to move upon him at Mahaneh Dan <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:33; Judg. 18:11">⚓</a>between Zorah and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 16:31">⚓</a>Eshtaol.<br/></span>
