<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>Samson Defeats the Philistines</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>After a while, in the time of wheat harvest, it happened that Samson visited his wife with a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 38:17">⚓</a>young goat. And he said, “Let me go in to my wife, into <i>her</i> room.” But her father would not permit him to go in.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_15_2"> <sup>2</sup>Her father said, “I really thought that you thoroughly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 14:20">⚓</a>hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. <i>Is</i> not her younger sister better than she? Please, take her instead.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_15_3"> <sup>3</sup>And Samson said to them, “This time I shall be blameless regarding the Philistines if I harm them!” </span>
<span class="verse cac_15_4"><sup>4</sup>Then Samson went and caught three hundred foxes; and he took torches, turned <i>the</i> <i>foxes</i> tail to tail, and put a torch between each pair of tails. </span>
<span class="verse cac_15_5"><sup>5</sup>When he had set the torches on fire, he let <i>the</i> <i>foxes</i> go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burned up both the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards <i>and</i> olive groves.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_15_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?”<br/> And they answered, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion.” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 14:15">⚓</a>So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_15_7"> <sup>7</sup>Samson said to them, “Since you would do a thing like this, I will surely take revenge on you, and after that I will cease.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_15_8"><sup>8</sup>So he attacked them hip and thigh with a great slaughter; then he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 11:6">⚓</a>Etam.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_15_9"> <sup>9</sup>Now the Philistines went up, encamped in Judah, and deployed themselves <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 15:19">⚓</a>against Lehi. </span>
<span class="verse cac_15_10"><sup>10</sup>And the men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?”<br/> So they answered, “We have come up to arrest Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_15_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, “Do you not know that the Philistines <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:25; Deut. 28:43; Judg. 13:1; 14:4; Ps. 106:40–42">⚓</a>rule over us? What <i>is</i> this you have done to us?”<br/> And he said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_15_12"> <sup>12</sup>But they said to him, “We have come down to arrest you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.”<br/> Then Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_15_13"> <sup>13</sup>So they spoke to him, saying, “No, but we will tie you securely and deliver you into their hand; but we will surely not kill you.” And they bound him with two <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 16:11, 12">⚓</a>new ropes and brought him up from the rock.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_15_14"> <sup>14</sup>When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting against him. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:10; 14:6">⚓</a>the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him; and the ropes that <i>were</i> on his arms became like flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds broke loose from his hands. </span>
<span class="verse cac_15_15"><sup>15</sup>He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:8; Josh. 23:10; Judg. 3:31">⚓</a>killed a thousand men with it. </span>
<span class="verse cac_15_16"><sup>16</sup>Then Samson said:<br/>  “With the jawbone of a donkey,<br/>   Heaps upon heaps,<br/>   With the jawbone of a donkey<br/>   I have slain a thousand men!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_15_17"> <sup>17</sup>And so it was, when he had finished speaking, that he threw the jawbone from his hand, and called that place Ramath Lehi.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_15_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then he became very thirsty; so he cried out to the Lord and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 3:7">⚓</a>“You have given this great deliverance by the hand of Your servant; and now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?” </span>
<span class="verse cac_15_19"><sup>19</sup>So God split the hollow place that <i>is</i> in Lehi, and water came out, and he drank; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:27; Is. 40:29">⚓</a>his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore he called its name En Hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day. </span>
<span class="verse cac_15_20"><sup>20</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:2; 12:7–14">⚓</a>he judged Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 16:31">⚓</a>twenty years <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 13:1">⚓</a>in the days of the Philistines.<br/></span>
