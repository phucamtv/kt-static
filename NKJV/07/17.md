<div class="title"><h1>17</h1><h3>Micah’s Idolatry</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now there was a man from the mountains of Ephraim, whose name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 18:2">⚓</a>Micah. </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_2"><sup>2</sup>And he said to his mother, “The eleven hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver that were taken from you, and on which you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 5:1">⚓</a>put a curse, even saying it in my ears—here <i>is</i> the silver with me; I took it.”<br/> And his mother said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:19">⚓</a>“<i>May</i> <i>you</i> <i>be</i> blessed by the Lord, my son!” </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_3"><sup>3</sup>So when he had returned the eleven hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver to his mother, his mother said, “I had wholly dedicated the silver from my hand to the Lord for my son, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:4, 23; 34:17; Lev. 19:4">⚓</a>make a carved image and a molded image; now therefore, I will return it to you.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_4"><sup>4</sup>Thus he returned the silver to his mother. Then his mother <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 46:6">⚓</a>took two hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver and gave them to the silversmith, and he made it into a carved image and a molded image; and they were in the house of Micah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_17_5"> <sup>5</sup>The man Micah had a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 18:24">⚓</a>shrine, and made an <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:27; 18:14">⚓</a>ephod and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:19, 30; Hos. 3:4">⚓</a>household idols; and he consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 18:1; 19:1">⚓</a>In those days <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no king in Israel; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:8; Judg. 21:25">⚓</a>everyone did <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in his own eyes.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_17_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now there was a young man from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:15; Judg. 19:1; Ruth 1:1, 2; Mic. 5:2; Matt. 2:1, 5, 6">⚓</a>Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah; he <i>was</i> a Levite, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 18:6">⚓</a>was staying there. </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_8"><sup>8</sup>The man departed from the city of Bethlehem in Judah to stay wherever he could find <i>a</i> <i>place.</i> Then he came to the mountains of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_9"><sup>9</sup>And Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?”<br/> So he said to him, “I <i>am</i> a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am on my way to find <i>a</i> <i>place</i> to stay.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_17_10"> <sup>10</sup>Micah said to him, “Dwell with me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 18:19">⚓</a>and be a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:8; Job 29:16">⚓</a>father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten <i>shekels</i> of silver per year, a suit of clothes, and your sustenance.” So the Levite went in. </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_11"><sup>11</sup>Then the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man became like one of his sons to him. </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_12"><sup>12</sup>So Micah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 17:5">⚓</a>consecrated the Levite, and the young man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 18:30">⚓</a>became his priest, and lived in the house of Micah. </span>
<span class="verse cac_17_13"><sup>13</sup>Then Micah said, “Now I know that the Lord will be good to me, since I have a Levite as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 18:4">⚓</a>priest!”<br/></span>
