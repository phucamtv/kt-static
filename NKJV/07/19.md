<div class="title"><h1>19</h1><h3>The Levite’s Concubine</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>And it came to pass in those days, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 17:6; 18:1; 21:25">⚓</a>when <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite staying in the remote mountains of Ephraim. He took for himself a concubine from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 17:7; Ruth 1:1">⚓</a>Bethlehem in Judah. </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_2"><sup>2</sup>But his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father’s house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there four whole months. </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_3"><sup>3</sup>Then her husband arose and went after her, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:3; 50:21">⚓</a>speak kindly to her <i>and</i> bring her back, having his servant and a couple of donkeys with him. So she brought him into her father’s house; and when the father of the young woman saw him, he was glad to meet him. </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_4"><sup>4</sup>Now his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, detained him; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_19_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then it came to pass on the fourth day that they arose early in the morning, and he stood to depart; but the young woman’s father said to his son-in-law, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:5; Judg. 19:8; Ps. 104:15">⚓</a>“Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_19_6"> <sup>6</sup>So they sat down, and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the young woman’s father said to the man, “Please be content to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_7"><sup>7</sup>And when the man stood to depart, his father-in-law urged him; so he lodged there again. </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_8"><sup>8</sup>Then he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, but the young woman’s father said, “Please refresh your heart.” So they delayed until afternoon; and both of them ate.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_19_9"> <sup>9</sup>And when the man stood to depart—he and his concubine and his servant—his father-in-law, the young woman’s father, said to him, “Look, the day is now drawing toward evening; please spend the night. See, the day is coming to an end; lodge here, that your heart may be merry. Tomorrow go your way early, so that you may get home.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_19_10"> <sup>10</sup>However, the man was not willing to spend that night; so he rose and departed, and came opposite <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:28; 1 Chr. 11:4, 5">⚓</a>Jebus (that <i>is,</i> Jerusalem). With him were the two saddled donkeys; his concubine <i>was</i> also with him. </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_11"><sup>11</sup>They <i>were</i> near Jebus, and the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, “Come, please, and let us turn aside into this city <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:8, 63; Judg. 1:21; 2 Sam. 5:6">⚓</a>of the Jebusites and lodge in it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_19_12"> <sup>12</sup>But his master said to him, “We will not turn aside here into a city of foreigners, who <i>are</i> not of the children of Israel; we will go on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:28">⚓</a>to Gibeah.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_13"><sup>13</sup>So he said to his servant, “Come, let us draw near to one of these places, and spend the night in Gibeah or in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:25">⚓</a>Ramah.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_14"><sup>14</sup>And they passed by and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin. </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_15"><sup>15</sup>They turned aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah. And when he went in, he sat down in the open square of the city, for no one would <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 25:43">⚓</a>take them into <i>his</i> house to spend the night.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_19_16"> <sup>16</sup>Just then an old man came in from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 104:23">⚓</a>his work in the field at evening, who also <i>was</i> from the mountains of Ephraim; he was staying in Gibeah, whereas the men of the place <i>were</i> Benjamites. </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_17"><sup>17</sup>And when he raised his eyes, he saw the traveler in the open square of the city; and the old man said, “Where are you going, and where do you come from?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_19_18"> <sup>18</sup>So he said to him, “We <i>are</i> passing from Bethlehem in Judah toward the remote mountains of Ephraim; I <i>am</i> from there. I went to Bethlehem in Judah; <i>now</i> I am going to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:1; Judg. 18:31; 20:18; 1 Sam. 1:3, 7">⚓</a>the house of the Lord. But there <i>is</i> no one who will take me into his house, </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_19"><sup>19</sup>although we have both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for myself, for your female servant, and for the young man <i>who</i> <i>is</i> with your servant; <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no lack of anything.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_19_20"> <sup>20</sup>And the old man said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:23; Judg. 6:23; 1 Sam. 25:6">⚓</a>“Peace <i>be</i> with you! However, <i>let</i> all your needs <i>be</i> my responsibility; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:2">⚓</a>only do not spend the night in the open square.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:32; 43:24">⚓</a>So he brought him into his house, and gave fodder to the donkeys. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:4; John 13:5">⚓</a>And they washed their feet, and ate and drank.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Gibeah’s Crime</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_19_22"> <sup>22</sup>As they were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 16:25; 19:6, 9">⚓</a>enjoying themselves, suddenly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:4, 5; Judg. 20:5; Hos. 9:9; 10:9">⚓</a>certain men of the city, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:13; 1 Sam. 2:12; 1 Kin. 21:10; (2 Cor. 6:15)">⚓</a>perverted men, surrounded the house <i>and</i> beat on the door. They spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:5; (Rom. 1:26, 27)">⚓</a>“Bring out the man who came to your house, that we may know him <i>carnally!</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_19_23"> <sup>23</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:6, 7">⚓</a>the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, “No, my brethren! I beg you, do not act <i>so</i> wickedly! Seeing this man has come into my house, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:7; Deut. 22:21; Judg. 20:6, 10; 2 Sam. 13:12">⚓</a>do not commit this outrage. </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:8">⚓</a>Look, <i>here</i> <i>is</i> my virgin daughter and <i>the</i> <i>man’s</i> concubine; let me bring them out now. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:2; Deut. 21:14">⚓</a>Humble them, and do with them as you please; but to this man do not do such a vile thing!” </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_25"><sup>25</sup>But the men would not heed him. So the man took his concubine and brought <i>her</i> out to them. And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:1">⚓</a>knew her and abused her all night until morning; and when the day began to break, they let her go.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_19_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then the woman came as the day was dawning, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her master <i>was,</i> till it was light.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_19_27"> <sup>27</sup>When her master arose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way, there was his concubine, fallen <i>at</i> the door of the house with her hands on the threshold. </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_28"><sup>28</sup>And he said to her, “Get up and let us be going.” But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:5">⚓</a>there was no answer. So the man lifted her onto the donkey; and the man got up and went to his place.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_19_29"> <sup>29</sup>When he entered his house he took a knife, laid hold of his concubine, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:6; 1 Sam. 11:7">⚓</a>divided her into twelve pieces, limb by limb, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse cac_19_30"><sup>30</sup>And so it was that all who saw it said, “No such deed has been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up from the land of Egypt until this day. Consider it, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:7; Prov. 13:10">⚓</a>confer, and speak up!”<br/></span>
