<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>Israel’s War with the Benjamites</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 22:12; Judg. 20:11; 21:5">⚓</a>all the children of Israel came out, from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 18:29; 1 Sam. 3:20; 2 Sam. 3:10; 24:2">⚓</a>Dan to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:2">⚓</a>Beersheba, as well as from the land of Gilead, and the congregation gathered together as one man before the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:17; 1 Sam. 7:5">⚓</a>at Mizpah. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_2"><sup>2</sup>And the leaders of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand foot soldiers <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:10">⚓</a>who drew the sword. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_3"><sup>3</sup>(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.)<br/> Then the children of Israel said, “Tell <i>us,</i> how did this wicked deed happen?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_20_4"> <sup>4</sup>So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, “My concubine and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:15">⚓</a>I went into Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, to spend the night. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:22">⚓</a>And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:25, 26">⚓</a>but instead they ravished my concubine so that she died. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_6"><sup>6</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:29">⚓</a>I took hold of my concubine, cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of the inheritance of Israel, because they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:15">⚓</a>committed lewdness and outrage in Israel. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_7"><sup>7</sup>Look! All of you <i>are</i> children of Israel; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:30">⚓</a>give your advice and counsel here and now!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_20_8"> <sup>8</sup>So all the people arose as one man, saying, “None <i>of</i> <i>us</i> will go to his tent, nor will any turn back to his house; </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_9"><sup>9</sup>but now this <i>is</i> the thing which we will do to Gibeah: <i>We</i> <i>will</i> <i>go</i> <i>up</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:3">⚓</a>against it by lot. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_10"><sup>10</sup>We will take ten men out of <i>every</i> hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, a hundred out of <i>every</i> thousand, and a thousand out of <i>every</i> ten thousand, to make provisions for the people, that when they come to Gibeah in Benjamin, they may repay all the vileness that they have done in Israel.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_11"><sup>11</sup>So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united together as one man.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_20_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:14; Josh. 22:13, 16">⚓</a>Then the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What <i>is</i> this wickedness that has occurred among you? </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_13"><sup>13</sup>Now therefore, deliver up the men, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:13; Judg. 19:22">⚓</a>the perverted men who <i>are</i> in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:12; 1 Cor. 5:13">⚓</a>remove the evil from Israel!” But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_14"><sup>14</sup>Instead, the children of Benjamin gathered together from their cities to Gibeah, to go to battle against the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_15"><sup>15</sup>And from their cities at that time <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 1:36, 37; 2:23; 26:41">⚓</a>the children of Benjamin numbered twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered seven hundred select men. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_16"><sup>16</sup>Among all this people <i>were</i> seven hundred select men <i>who</i> <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:15; 1 Chr. 12:2">⚓</a>left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair’s <i>breadth</i> and not miss. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_17"><sup>17</sup>Now besides Benjamin, the men of Israel numbered four hundred thousand men who drew the sword; all of these <i>were</i> men of war.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_20_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then the children of Israel arose and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:23, 26">⚓</a>went up to the house of God to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:21">⚓</a>inquire of God. They said, “Which of us shall go up first to battle against the children of Benjamin?”<br/> The Lord said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:1, 2">⚓</a>“Judah first!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_20_19"> <sup>19</sup>So the children of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_20"><sup>20</sup>And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel put themselves in battle array to fight against them at Gibeah. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_21"><sup>21</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 49:27)">⚓</a>the children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and on that day cut down to the ground twenty-two thousand men of the Israelites. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_22"><sup>22</sup>And the people, that is, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and again formed the battle line at the place where they had put themselves in array on the first day. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:26, 27">⚓</a>Then the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until evening, and asked counsel of the Lord, saying, “Shall I again draw near for battle against the children of my brother Benjamin?”<br/> And the Lord said, “Go up against him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_20_24"> <sup>24</sup>So the children of Israel approached the children of Benjamin on the second day. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_25"><sup>25</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:21">⚓</a>Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah on the second day, and cut down to the ground eighteen thousand more of the children of Israel; all these drew the sword.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_20_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then all the children of Israel, that is, all the people, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:18, 23; 21:2">⚓</a>went up and came to the house of God and wept. They sat there before the Lord and fasted that day until evening; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_27"><sup>27</sup>So the children of Israel inquired of the Lord (<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:1; 1 Sam. 1:3; 3:3; 4:3, 4">⚓</a>the ark of the covenant of God <i>was</i> there in those days, </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_28"><sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 25:7, 13; Josh. 24:33">⚓</a>and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 10:8; 18:5">⚓</a>stood before it in those days), saying, “Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of my brother Benjamin, or shall I cease?”<br/> And the Lord said, “Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_20_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 8:4">⚓</a>set men in ambush all around Gibeah. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_30"><sup>30</sup>And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in battle array against Gibeah as at the other times. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_31"><sup>31</sup>So the children of Benjamin went out against the people, <i>and</i> were drawn away from the city. They began to strike down <i>and</i> kill some of the people, as at the other times, in the highways <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 21:19">⚓</a>(one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah) and in the field, about thirty men of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_32"><sup>32</sup>And the children of Benjamin said, “They <i>are</i> defeated before us, as at first.”<br/> But the children of Israel said, “Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_33"><sup>33</sup>So all the men of Israel rose from their place and put themselves in battle array at Baal Tamar. Then Israel’s men in ambush burst forth from their position in the plain of Geba. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_34"><sup>34</sup>And ten thousand select men from all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 8:14; Job 21:13; Is. 47:11">⚓</a>But <i>the</i> <i>Benjamites</i> did not know that disaster <i>was</i> upon them. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_35"><sup>35</sup>The Lord defeated Benjamin before Israel. And the children of Israel destroyed that day twenty-five thousand one hundred Benjamites; all these drew the sword.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_20_36"> <sup>36</sup>So the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 8:15">⚓</a>The men of Israel had given ground to the Benjamites, because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_37"><sup>37</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 8:19">⚓</a>And the men in ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah; the men in ambush spread out and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_38"><sup>38</sup>Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 8:20">⚓</a>smoke rise up from the city, </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_39"><sup>39</sup>whereupon the men of Israel would turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike <i>and</i> kill about thirty of the men of Israel. For they said, “Surely they are defeated before us, as <i>in</i> the first battle.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_40"><sup>40</sup>But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, the Benjamites <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 8:20">⚓</a>looked behind them, and there was the whole city going up <i>in</i> <i>smoke</i> to heaven. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_41"><sup>41</sup>And when the men of Israel turned back, the men of Benjamin panicked, for they saw that disaster had come upon them. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_42"><sup>42</sup>Therefore they turned <i>their</i> <i>backs</i> before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them, and whoever <i>came</i> out of the cities they destroyed in their midst. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_43"><sup>43</sup>They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, <i>and</i> easily trampled them down as far as the front of Gibeah toward the east. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_44"><sup>44</sup>And eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these <i>were</i> men of valor. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_45"><sup>45</sup>Then they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:32; 1 Chr. 6:77; Zech. 14:10">⚓</a>Rimmon; and they cut down five thousand of them on the highways. Then they pursued them relentlessly up to Gidom, and killed two thousand of them. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_46"><sup>46</sup>So all who fell of Benjamin that day were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these <i>were</i> men of valor.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_20_47"> <sup>47</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 21:13">⚓</a>But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they stayed at the rock of Rimmon for four months. </span>
<span class="verse cac_20_48"><sup>48</sup>And the men of Israel turned back against the children of Benjamin, and struck them down with the edge of the sword—from <i>every</i> city, men and beasts, all who were found. They also set fire to all the cities they came to.<br/></span>
