<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>Wives Provided for the Benjamites</h3></div>
<span class="verse cac_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:1">⚓</a>the men of Israel had sworn an oath at Mizpah, saying, “None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_2"><sup>2</sup>Then the people came <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:18, 26">⚓</a>to the house of God, and remained there before God till evening. They lifted up their voices and wept bitterly, </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_3"><sup>3</sup>and said, “O Lord God of Israel, why has this come to pass in Israel, that today there should be one tribe <i>missing</i> in Israel?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_21_4"> <sup>4</sup>So it was, on the next morning, that the people rose early and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:5; 2 Sam. 24:25">⚓</a>built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_5"><sup>5</sup>The children of Israel said, “Who <i>is</i> <i>there</i> among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up with the assembly to the Lord?” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:1–3">⚓</a>For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the Lord at Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_6"><sup>6</sup>And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, “One tribe is cut off from Israel today. </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_7"><sup>7</sup>What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters as wives?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_21_8"> <sup>8</sup>And they said, “What one <i>is</i> <i>there</i> from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord?” And, in fact, no one had come to the camp from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 11:1; 31:11">⚓</a>Jabesh Gilead to the assembly. </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_9"><sup>9</sup>For when the people were counted, indeed, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead <i>was</i> there. </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_10"><sup>10</sup>So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 31:17; Judg. 5:23; 1 Sam. 11:7">⚓</a>“Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children. </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_11"><sup>11</sup>And this <i>is</i> the thing that you shall do: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 31:17; Deut. 20:13, 14">⚓</a>You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man intimately.” </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_12"><sup>12</sup>So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:1; Judg. 18:31">⚓</a>Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_21_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then the whole congregation sent <i>word</i> to the children of Benjamin <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:47">⚓</a>who <i>were</i> at the rock of Rimmon, and announced peace to them. </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_14"><sup>14</sup>So Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_21_15"> <sup>15</sup>And the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 21:6">⚓</a>grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a void in the tribes of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_21_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then the elders of the congregation said, “What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?” </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_17"><sup>17</sup>And they said, “<i>There</i> <i>must</i> <i>be</i> an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel. </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_18"><sup>18</sup>However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:35; 21:1">⚓</a>for the children of Israel have sworn an oath, saying, ‘Cursed <i>be</i> the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_19"><sup>19</sup>Then they said, “In fact, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> a yearly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:2">⚓</a>feast of the Lord in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:5; Josh. 18:1; Judg. 18:31; 1 Sam. 1:3">⚓</a>Shiloh, which <i>is</i> north of Bethel, on the east side of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:31">⚓</a>highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_21_20"> <sup>20</sup>Therefore they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, “Go, lie in wait in the vineyards, </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_21"><sup>21</sup>and watch; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:20; Judg. 11:34; 1 Sam. 18:6">⚓</a>to perform their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; then go to the land of Benjamin. </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_22"><sup>22</sup>Then it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, ‘Be kind to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for <i>it</i> <i>is</i> not <i>as</i> <i>though</i> you have given the <i>women</i> to them at this time, making yourselves guilty of your oath.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_21_23"> <sup>23</sup>And the children of Benjamin did so; they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:48">⚓</a>rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them. </span>
<span class="verse cac_21_24"><sup>24</sup>So the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they went out from there, every man to his inheritance.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cac_21_25"> <sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 17:6; 18:1; 19:1">⚓</a>In those days <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no king in Israel; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:8; Judg. 17:6">⚓</a>everyone did <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in his own eyes.<br/></span>
