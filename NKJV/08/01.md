<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>Elimelech’s Family Goes to Moab</h3></div>
<span class="verse ru_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass, in the days when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:16–18">⚓</a>the judges ruled, that there was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:10; 26:1; 2 Kin. 8:1">⚓</a>a famine in the land. And a certain man of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 17:8; Mic. 5:2">⚓</a>Bethlehem, Judah, went to dwell in the country of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:37">⚓</a>Moab, he and his wife and his two sons. </span>
<span class="verse ru_1_2"><sup>2</sup>The name of the man <i>was</i> Elimelech, the name of his wife <i>was</i> Naomi, and the names of his two sons <i>were</i> Mahlon and Chilion—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:19; 1 Sam. 1:1; 1 Kin. 11:26">⚓</a>Ephrathites of Bethlehem, Judah. And they went <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:30">⚓</a>to the country of Moab and remained there. </span>
<span class="verse ru_1_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons. </span>
<span class="verse ru_1_4"><sup>4</sup>Now they took wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one <i>was</i> Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years. </span>
<span class="verse ru_1_5"><sup>5</sup>Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; so the woman survived her two sons and her husband.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Naomi Returns with Ruth</h3></div>
<span class="verse ru_1_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the Lord had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:16; 4:31; Jer. 29:10; Zeph. 2:7; Luke 1:68">⚓</a>visited His people by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 132:15; Matt. 6:11">⚓</a>giving them bread. </span>
<span class="verse ru_1_7"><sup>7</sup>Therefore she went out from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse ru_1_8"><sup>8</sup>And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:15">⚓</a>“Go, return each to her mother’s house. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 1:16–18">⚓</a>The Lord deal kindly with you, as you have dealt <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 2:20">⚓</a>with the dead and with me. </span>
<span class="verse ru_1_9"><sup>9</sup>The Lord grant that you may find <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 3:1">⚓</a>rest, each in the house of her husband.”<br/> So she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept. </span>
<span class="verse ru_1_10"><sup>10</sup>And they said to her, “Surely we will return with you to your people.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_1_11"> <sup>11</sup>But Naomi said, “Turn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? <i>Are</i> there still sons in my womb, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 38:11; Deut. 25:5">⚓</a>that they may be your husbands? </span>
<span class="verse ru_1_12"><sup>12</sup>Turn back, my daughters, go—for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, <i>if</i> I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons, </span>
<span class="verse ru_1_13"><sup>13</sup>would you wait for them till they were grown? Would you restrain yourselves from having husbands? No, my daughters; for it grieves me very much for your sakes that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:15; Job 19:21; Ps. 32:4; 38:2">⚓</a>the hand of the Lord has gone out against me!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_1_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 17:17)">⚓</a>clung to her.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_1_15"> <sup>15</sup>And she said, “Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:24">⚓</a>her people and to her gods; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:15">⚓</a>return after your sister-in-law.” </span>
<span class="verse ru_1_16"><sup>16</sup>But Ruth said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:2, 4, 6">⚓</a>“Entreat me not to leave you,<br/>   <i>Or</i> <i>to</i> turn back from following after you;<br/>   For wherever you go, I will go;<br/>   And wherever you lodge, I will lodge;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 2:11, 12">⚓</a>Your people <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> my people,<br/>   And your God, my God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_1_17">   <sup>17</sup>Where you die, I will die,<br/>   And there will I be buried.<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:17; 2 Sam. 19:13; 2 Kin. 6:31">⚓</a>The Lord do so to me, and more also,<br/>   If <i>anything</i> <i>but</i> death parts you and me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_1_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:14">⚓</a>When she saw that she was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_1_19"> <sup>19</sup>Now the two of them went until they came to Bethlehem. And it happened, when they had come to Bethlehem, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:10">⚓</a>all the city was excited because of them; and the women said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 23:7; Lam. 2:15">⚓</a>“<i>Is</i> this Naomi?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_1_20"> <sup>20</sup>But she said to them, “Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. </span>
<span class="verse ru_1_21"><sup>21</sup>I went out full, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:21">⚓</a>and the Lord has brought me home again empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the Lord has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_1_22"> <sup>22</sup>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab. Now they came to Bethlehem <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 2:23; 2 Sam. 21:9">⚓</a>at the beginning of barley harvest.<br/></span>
