<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Ruth Meets Boaz</h3></div>
<span class="verse ru_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>There was a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 3:2, 12">⚓</a>relative of Naomi’s husband, a man of great wealth, of the family of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:2">⚓</a>Elimelech. His name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 4:21">⚓</a>Boaz. </span>
<span class="verse ru_2_2"><sup>2</sup>So Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:9, 10; 23:22; Deut. 24:19">⚓</a>field, and glean heads of grain after <i>him</i> in whose sight I may find favor.”<br/> And she said to her, “Go, my daughter.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then she left, and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to the part of the field <i>belonging</i> to Boaz, who <i>was</i> of the family of Elimelech.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now behold, Boaz came from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:1">⚓</a>Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 129:7, 8; Luke 1:28; 2 Thess. 3:16">⚓</a>“The Lord<i>be</i> with you!”<br/> And they answered him, “The Lord bless you!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose young woman <i>is</i> this?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_6"> <sup>6</sup>So the servant who was in charge of the reapers answered and said, “It <i>is</i> the young Moabite woman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:22">⚓</a>who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. </span>
<span class="verse ru_2_7"><sup>7</sup>And she said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came and has continued from morning until now, though she rested a little in the house.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Boaz said to Ruth, “You will listen, my daughter, will you not? Do not go to glean in another field, nor go from here, but stay close by my young women. </span>
<span class="verse ru_2_9"><sup>9</sup><i>Let</i> your eyes <i>be</i> on the field which they reap, and go after them. Have I not commanded the young men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink from what the young men have drawn.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_10"> <sup>10</sup>So she <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:23">⚓</a>fell on her face, bowed down to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:18">⚓</a>favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I <i>am</i> a foreigner?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_11"> <sup>11</sup>And Boaz answered and said to her, “It has been fully reported to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:14–18">⚓</a>all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and <i>how</i> you have left your father and your mother and the land of your birth, and have come to a people whom you did not know before. </span>
<span class="verse ru_2_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:19; Ps. 58:11">⚓</a>The Lord repay your work, and a full reward be given you by the Lord God of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:16; Ps. 17:8; 36:7; 57:1; 61:4; 63:7; 91:4">⚓</a>under whose wings you have come for refuge.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then she said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:15; 1 Sam. 1:18">⚓</a>“Let me find favor in your sight, my lord; for you have comforted me, and have spoken kindly to your maidservant, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:41">⚓</a>though I am not like one of your maidservants.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_14"> <sup>14</sup>Now Boaz said to her at mealtime, “Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed parched <i>grain</i> to her; and she ate and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 2:18">⚓</a>was satisfied, and kept some back. </span>
<span class="verse ru_2_15"><sup>15</sup>And when she rose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her. </span>
<span class="verse ru_2_16"><sup>16</sup>Also let <i>grain</i> from the bundles fall purposely for her; leave <i>it</i> that she may glean, and do not rebuke her.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_17"> <sup>17</sup>So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:22">⚓</a>barley. </span>
<span class="verse ru_2_18"><sup>18</sup>Then she took <i>it</i> up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned.<br/> So she brought out and gave to her <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 2:14">⚓</a>what she had kept back after she had been satisfied.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_19"> <sup>19</sup>And her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? And where did you work? Blessed be the one who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 2:10; (Ps. 41:1)">⚓</a>took notice of you.”<br/> So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, “The man’s name with whom I worked today <i>is</i> Boaz.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 3:10; 2 Sam. 2:5">⚓</a>“Blessed <i>be</i> he of the Lord, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 17:17">⚓</a>has not forsaken His kindness to the living and the dead!” And Naomi said to her, “This man <i>is</i> a relation of ours, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 3:9; 4:4, 6">⚓</a>one of our close relatives.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_21"> <sup>21</sup>Ruth the Moabitess said, “He also said to me, ‘You shall stay close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_2_22"> <sup>22</sup>And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, and that people do not meet you in any other field.” </span>
<span class="verse ru_2_23"><sup>23</sup>So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz, to glean until the end of barley harvest and wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.<br/></span>
