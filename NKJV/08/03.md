<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Ruth’s Redemption Assured</h3></div>
<span class="verse ru_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 7:36; 1 Tim. 5:8">⚓</a>shall I not seek <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:9">⚓</a>security for you, that it may be well with you? </span>
<span class="verse ru_3_2"><sup>2</sup>Now Boaz, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 2:3, 8">⚓</a>whose young women you were with, <i>is</i> <i>he</i> not our relative? In fact, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. </span>
<span class="verse ru_3_3"><sup>3</sup>Therefore wash yourself and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 14:2">⚓</a>anoint yourself, put on your <i>best</i> garment and go down to the threshing floor; <i>but</i> do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. </span>
<span class="verse ru_3_4"><sup>4</sup>Then it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies; and you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lie down; and he will tell you what you should do.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_3_5"> <sup>5</sup>And she said to her, “All that you say to me I will do.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_3_6"> <sup>6</sup>So she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law instructed her. </span>
<span class="verse ru_3_7"><sup>7</sup>And after Boaz had eaten and drunk, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:6, 9, 22; 2 Sam. 13:28; Esth. 1:10">⚓</a>his heart was cheerful, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came softly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_3_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now it happened at midnight that the man was startled, and turned himself; and there, a woman was lying at his feet. </span>
<span class="verse ru_3_9"><sup>9</sup>And he said, “Who <i>are</i> you?”<br/> So she answered, “I <i>am</i> Ruth, your maidservant. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 16:8">⚓</a>Take your maidservant under your wing, for you are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 2:20; 3:12">⚓</a>a close relative.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_3_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 2:20">⚓</a>“Blessed <i>are</i> you of the Lord, my daughter! For you have shown more kindness at the end than <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:8">⚓</a>at the beginning, in that you did not go after young men, whether poor or rich. </span>
<span class="verse ru_3_11"><sup>11</sup>And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you request, for all the people of my town know that you <i>are</i> a virtuous woman. </span>
<span class="verse ru_3_12"><sup>12</sup>Now it is true that I <i>am</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 12:4; 31:10–31">⚓</a>close relative; however, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 3:9">⚓</a>there is a relative closer than I. </span>
<span class="verse ru_3_13"><sup>13</sup>Stay this night, and in the morning it shall be <i>that</i> if he will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 4:1">⚓</a>perform the duty of a close relative for you—good; let him do it. But if he does not want to perform the duty for you, then I will perform the duty for you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 25:5–10; Ruth 4:5, 10; Matt. 22:24">⚓</a><i>as</i> the Lord lives! Lie down until morning.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_3_14"> <sup>14</sup>So she lay at his feet until morning, and she arose before one could recognize another. Then he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:19; Jer. 4:2; 12:16">⚓</a>“Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.” </span>
<span class="verse ru_3_15"><sup>15</sup>Also he said, “Bring the shawl that <i>is</i> on you and hold it.” And when she held it, he measured six <i>ephahs</i> of barley, and laid <i>it</i> on her. Then she went into the city.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_3_16"> <sup>16</sup>When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “<i>Is</i> that you, my daughter?”<br/> Then she told her all that the man had done for her. </span>
<span class="verse ru_3_17"><sup>17</sup>And she said, “These six <i>ephahs</i> of barley he gave me; for he said to me, ‘Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_3_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then she said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 12:17; 14:16; 1 Cor. 10:32; 2 Cor. 8:21; 1 Thess. 5:22)">⚓</a>“Sit still, my daughter, until you know how the matter will turn out; for the man will not rest until he has concluded the matter this day.”<br/></span>
