<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Boaz Redeems Ruth</h3></div>
<span class="verse ru_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there; and behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 37:3, 5)">⚓</a>the close relative of whom Boaz had spoken came by. So Boaz said, “Come aside, friend, sit down here.” So he came aside and sat down. </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_2"><sup>2</sup>And he took ten men of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 3:12">⚓</a>the elders of the city, and said, “Sit down here.” So they sat down. </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_3"><sup>3</sup>Then he said to the close relative, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, sold the piece of land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:8; Prov. 31:23">⚓</a>which <i>belonged</i> to our brother Elimelech. </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_4"><sup>4</sup>And I thought to inform you, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 25:25">⚓</a>‘Buy <i>it</i> back <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 32:7, 8">⚓</a>in the presence of the inhabitants and the elders of my people. If you will redeem <i>it,</i> redeem <i>it;</i> but if you will not redeem <i>it, then</i> tell me, that I may know; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 23:18">⚓</a>for <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no one but you to redeem <i>it,</i> and I <i>am</i> next after you.’ ”<br/> And he said, “I will redeem <i>it.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_4_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must also buy <i>it</i> from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 25:25">⚓</a>to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_4_6"> <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 38:8; Deut. 25:5, 6; Ruth 3:13; Matt. 22:24">⚓</a>And the close relative said, “I cannot redeem <i>it</i> for myself, lest I ruin my own inheritance. You redeem my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot redeem <i>it.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_4_7"> <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 3:12, 13; Job 19:14">⚓</a>Now this <i>was</i> <i>the</i> <i>custom</i> in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging, to confirm anything: one man took off his sandal and gave <i>it</i> to the other, and this <i>was</i> a confirmation in Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_4_8"> <sup>8</sup>Therefore the close relative said to Boaz, “Buy <i>it</i> for yourself.” So he took off his sandal. </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_9"><sup>9</sup>And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You <i>are</i> witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that <i>was</i> Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, from the hand of Naomi. </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_10"><sup>10</sup>Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have acquired as my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 25:7–10">⚓</a>that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from his position at the gate. You <i>are</i> witnesses this day.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_4_11"> <sup>11</sup>And all the people who <i>were</i> at the gate, and the elders, said, “<i>We</i> <i>are</i> witnesses. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 25:6">⚓</a>The Lord make the woman who is coming to your house like Rachel and Leah, the two who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 127:3; 128:3">⚓</a>built the house of Israel; and may you prosper in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:25–30; Deut. 25:9">⚓</a>Ephrathah and be famous in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:16–18">⚓</a>Bethlehem. </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_12"><sup>12</sup>May your house be like the house of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:4–13; Mic. 5:2; Matt. 2:1–8">⚓</a>Perez, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 2:4; Matt. 1:3">⚓</a>whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 38:6–29">⚓</a>the offspring which the Lord will give you from this young woman.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Descendants of Boaz and Ruth</h3></div>
<span class="verse ru_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>So Boaz <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:20">⚓</a>took Ruth and she became his wife; and when he went in to her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 3:11">⚓</a>the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son. </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_14"><sup>14</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:31; 33:5; Matt. 1:5">⚓</a>the women said to Naomi, “Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord, who has not left you this day without a close relative; and may his name be famous in Israel! </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_15"><sup>15</sup>And may he be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:58; (Rom. 12:15)">⚓</a>better to you than seven sons, has borne him.” </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_16"><sup>16</sup>Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her bosom, and became a nurse to him. </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:8">⚓</a>Also the neighbor women gave him a name, saying, “There is a son born to Naomi.” And they called his name Obed. He <i>is</i> the father of Jesse, the father of David.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ru_4_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:58">⚓</a>Now this <i>is</i> the genealogy of Perez: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 2:4, 5; Matt. 1:1–7">⚓</a>Perez begot Hezron; </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_19"><sup>19</sup>Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab; </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_20"><sup>20</sup>Amminadab begot <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:20, 21">⚓</a>Nahshon, and Nahshon begot <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 1:7">⚓</a>Salmon; </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_21"><sup>21</sup>Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed; </span>
<span class="verse ru_4_22"><sup>22</sup>Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:4">⚓</a>David.<br/></span>
