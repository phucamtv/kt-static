<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>The Family of Elkanah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim, of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 2:15; Matt. 1:6">⚓</a>mountains of Ephraim, and his name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 17:17, 18; 24:33">⚓</a>Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 6:27, 33–38">⚓</a>an Ephraimite. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_2"><sup>2</sup>And he had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:2">⚓</a>two wives: the name of one <i>was</i> Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_3"><sup>3</sup>This man went up from his city <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 21:15–17">⚓</a>yearly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:14, 23; Judg. 21:19; 1 Sam. 1:21; Luke 2:41">⚓</a>to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:5–7; 16:16">⚓</a>Shiloh. Also the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, <i>were</i> there. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_4"><sup>4</sup>And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:1">⚓</a>offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_5"><sup>5</sup>But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:17, 18">⚓</a>although the Lord had closed her womb. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_6"><sup>6</sup>And her rival also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:1; 30:1, 2">⚓</a>provoked her severely, to make her miserable, because the Lord had closed her womb. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_7"><sup>7</sup>So it was, year by year, when she went up to the house of the Lord, that she provoked her; therefore she wept and did not eat.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Hannah’s Vow</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? And why is your heart grieved? <i>Am</i> I not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 24:21">⚓</a>better to you than ten sons?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_9"> <sup>9</sup>So Hannah arose after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 4:15">⚓</a>the tabernacle of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:3">⚓</a>And she <i>was</i> in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the Lord and wept in anguish. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_11"><sup>11</sup>Then she <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 7:11">⚓</a>made a vow and said, “O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:20; Num. 30:6–11">⚓</a>look on the affliction of Your maidservant and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 25:18">⚓</a>remember me, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 8:1">⚓</a>no razor shall come upon his head.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_12"> <sup>12</sup>And it happened, as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli watched her mouth. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_13"><sup>13</sup>Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_14"><sup>14</sup>So Eli said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away from you!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_15"> <sup>15</sup>But Hannah answered and said, “No, my lord, I <i>am</i> a woman of sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 6:5; Judg. 13:5">⚓</a>poured out my soul before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_16"><sup>16</sup>“Do not consider your maidservant a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 30:16; Ps. 42:4; 62:8; Lam. 2:19">⚓</a>wicked woman, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have spoken until now.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Eli answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:13">⚓</a>“Go in peace, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 18:6; 1 Sam. 25:35; 2 Kin. 5:19; Mark 5:34; Luke 7:50">⚓</a>the God of Israel grant your petition which you have asked of Him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_18"> <sup>18</sup>And she said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 20:3–5">⚓</a>“Let your maidservant find favor in your sight.” So the woman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:15; Ruth 2:13">⚓</a>went her way and ate, and her face was no longer <i>sad.</i><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Samuel Is Born and Dedicated</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then they rose early in the morning and worshiped before the Lord, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 15:13; Eccl. 9:7; Rom. 15:13">⚓</a>knew Hannah his wife, and the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:1">⚓</a>remembered her. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_20"><sup>20</sup>So it came to pass in the process of time that Hannah conceived and bore a son, and called his name Samuel, <i>saying,</i> “Because I have asked for him from the Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_21"> <sup>21</sup>Now the man Elkanah and all his house <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:1; 30:22">⚓</a>went up to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_22"><sup>22</sup>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “<i>Not</i> until the child is weaned; then I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:11; 1 Sam. 1:3">⚓</a>take him, that he may appear before the Lord and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:22">⚓</a>remain there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:11, 28">⚓</a>forever.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_23"> <sup>23</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 21:6">⚓</a>Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him. Only let the Lord establish His word.” Then the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_24"> <sup>24</sup>Now when she had weaned him, she <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 30:7, 10, 11">⚓</a>took him up with her, with three bulls, one ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and brought him to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 15:9, 10; Deut. 12:5, 6">⚓</a>the house of the Lord in Shiloh. And the child <i>was</i> young. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_25"><sup>25</sup>Then they slaughtered a bull, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:1; 1 Sam. 4:3, 4">⚓</a>brought the child to Eli. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_26"><sup>26</sup>And she said, “O my lord! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:22">⚓</a>As your soul lives, my lord, I <i>am</i> the woman who stood by you here, praying to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:2, 4, 6; 4:30">⚓</a>For this child I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my petition which I asked of Him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_1_28"><sup>28</sup>Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the Lord.” So they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 7:7)">⚓</a>worshiped the Lord there.<br/></span>
