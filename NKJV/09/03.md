<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Samuel’s First Prophecy</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:27">⚓</a>the boy Samuel ministered to the Lord before Eli. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:11, 18">⚓</a>the word of the Lord was rare in those days; <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no widespread revelation. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_2"><sup>2</sup>And it came to pass at that time, while Eli <i>was</i> lying down in his place, and when his eyes had begun to grow <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 74:9; Ezek. 7:26; Amos 8:11, 12">⚓</a>so dim that he could not see, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_3"><sup>3</sup>and before <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:1; 48:10; 1 Sam. 4:15">⚓</a>the lamp of God went out in the tabernacle of the Lord where the ark of God <i>was,</i> and while Samuel was lying down, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_4"><sup>4</sup>that the Lord called Samuel. And he answered, “Here I am!” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_5"><sup>5</sup>So he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.”<br/> And he said, “I did not call; lie down again.” And he went and lay down.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then the Lord called yet again, “Samuel!”<br/> So Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” He answered, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_7"><sup>7</sup>(Now Samuel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 27:20, 21">⚓</a>did not yet know the Lord, nor was the word of the Lord yet revealed to him.)<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_8"> <sup>8</sup>And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. So he arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you did call me.”<br/> Then Eli perceived that the Lord had called the boy. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_9"><sup>9</sup>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down; and it shall be, if He calls you, that you must say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:12; Acts 19:2; 1 Cor. 13:11">⚓</a>‘Speak, Lord, for Your servant hears.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now the Lord came and stood and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!”<br/> And Samuel answered, “Speak, for Your servant hears.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then the Lord said to Samuel: “Behold, I will do something in Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:17">⚓</a>at which both ears of everyone who hears it will tingle. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_12"><sup>12</sup>In that day I will perform against Eli <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 21:12; Jer. 19:3">⚓</a>all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:27–36; Ezek. 12:25; Luke 21:33">⚓</a>For I have told him that I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:29–31">⚓</a>judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:22; Ezek. 7:3; 18:30">⚓</a>his sons made themselves vile, and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:12, 17, 22">⚓</a>did not restrain them. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_14"><sup>14</sup>And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:23, 25">⚓</a>shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_15"> <sup>15</sup>So Samuel lay down until morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord. And Samuel was afraid to tell Eli the vision. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_16"><sup>16</sup>Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!”<br/> He answered, “Here I am.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_17"> <sup>17</sup>And he said, “What <i>is</i> the word that <i>the</i> <i>Lord</i> spoke to you? Please do not hide <i>it</i> from me. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 15:30, 31; Is. 22:14; Heb. 10:4, 26–31">⚓</a>God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that He said to you.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_18"><sup>18</sup>Then Samuel told him everything, and hid nothing from him. And he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:17">⚓</a>“It <i>is</i> the Lord. Let Him do what seems good to Him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_19"> <sup>19</sup>So Samuel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:50; Ex. 34:5–7; Lev. 10:3; Is. 39:8; Acts 5:39">⚓</a>grew, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:21">⚓</a>the Lord was with him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:22; 28:15; 39:2, 21, 23">⚓</a>and let none of his words fall to the ground. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_20"><sup>20</sup>And all Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:6">⚓</a>from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel <i>had</i> <i>been</i> established as a prophet of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_3_21"><sup>21</sup>Then the Lord appeared again in Shiloh. For the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:1">⚓</a>the word of the Lord.<br/></span>
