<span class="verse 1sa_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Ark of God Captured</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_1"> Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines, and encamped beside <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:1, 4">⚓</a>Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_2"><sup>2</sup>Then the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:12">⚓</a>Philistines put themselves in battle array against Israel. And when they joined battle, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_3"><sup>3</sup>And when the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the Lord defeated us today before the Philistines? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:9">⚓</a>Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Shiloh to us, that when it comes among us it may save us from the hand of our enemies.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_4"><sup>4</sup>So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 10:35; Josh. 6:6–21">⚓</a>who dwells <i>between</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:18–21; 1 Sam. 6:2; Ps. 80:1">⚓</a>the cherubim. And the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 7:89">⚓</a>two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, <i>were</i> there with the ark of the covenant of God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_5"> <sup>5</sup>And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel shouted so loudly that the earth shook. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_6"><sup>6</sup>Now when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What <i>does</i> the sound of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews <i>mean?</i>” Then they understood that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_7"><sup>7</sup>So the Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp!” And they said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:12">⚓</a>“Woe to us! For such a thing has never happened before. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_8"><sup>8</sup>Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These <i>are</i> the gods who struck the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:14">⚓</a>Be strong and conduct yourselves like men, you Philistines, that you do not become servants of the Hebrews, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 16:13">⚓</a>as they have been to you. Conduct yourselves like men, and fight!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_10"> <sup>10</sup>So the Philistines fought, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 13:1; 1 Sam. 14:21">⚓</a>Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent. There was a very great slaughter, and there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_11"><sup>11</sup>Also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:17; Deut. 28:15, 25; 1 Sam. 4:2; 2 Sam. 18:17; 19:8; 2 Kin. 14:12; 2 Chr. 25:22">⚓</a>the ark of God was captured; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:32; Ps. 78:60, 61">⚓</a>the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Eli</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then a man of Benjamin ran from the battle line the same day, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:34; Ps. 78:64">⚓</a>came to Shiloh with his clothes torn and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:2">⚓</a>dirt on his head. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_13"><sup>13</sup>Now when he came, there was Eli, sitting on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:6; 2 Sam. 13:19; 15:32; Neh. 9:1; Job 2:12">⚓</a>a seat by the wayside watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told <i>it,</i> all the city cried out. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_14"><sup>14</sup>When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said, “What <i>does</i> the sound of this tumult <i>mean?</i>” And the man came quickly and told Eli. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_15"><sup>15</sup>Eli was ninety-eight years old, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:9; 4:18">⚓</a>his eyes were so dim that he could not see.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then the man said to Eli, “I <i>am</i> he who came from the battle. And I fled today from the battle line.”<br/> And he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:2; 1 Kin. 14:4">⚓</a>“What happened, my son?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_17"> <sup>17</sup>So the messenger answered and said, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead; and the ark of God has been captured.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then it happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that Eli fell off the seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for the man was old and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ichabod</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_19"> <sup>19</sup>Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was with child, <i>due</i> to be delivered; and when she heard the news that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth, for her labor pains came upon her. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_20"><sup>20</sup>And about the time of her death <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:4">⚓</a>the women who stood by her said to her, “Do not fear, for you have borne a son.” But she did not answer, nor did she regard <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_21"><sup>21</sup>Then she named the child <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:16–19">⚓</a>Ichabod, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:3">⚓</a>“The glory has departed from Israel!” because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_4_22"><sup>22</sup>And she said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.”<br/></span>
