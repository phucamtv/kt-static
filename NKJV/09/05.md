<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>The Philistines and the Ark</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 26:8; 78:61; (Jer. 2:11)">⚓</a>from Ebenezer to Ashdod. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_5_2"><sup>2</sup>When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 4:1; 7:12">⚓</a>Dagon and set it by Dagon. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_5_3"><sup>3</sup>And when the people of Ashdod arose early in the morning, there was Dagon, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 16:23–30; 1 Chr. 10:8–10">⚓</a>fallen on its face to the earth before the ark of the Lord. So they took Dagon and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 19:1; 46:1, 2">⚓</a>set it in its place again. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_5_4"><sup>4</sup>And when they arose early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen on its face to the ground before the ark of the Lord. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 46:7">⚓</a>The head of Dagon and both the palms of its hands <i>were</i> broken off on the threshold; only Dagon’s <i>torso</i> was left of it. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_5_5"><sup>5</sup>Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon’s house <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 50:2; Ezek. 6:4, 6; Mic. 1:7">⚓</a>tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_5_6"> <sup>6</sup>But the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zeph. 1:9">⚓</a>hand of the Lord was heavy on the people of Ashdod, and He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:3; Deut. 2:15; 1 Sam. 5:7; 7:13; Ps. 32:4; 145:20; 147:6">⚓</a>ravaged them and struck them with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 6:5">⚓</a>tumors, <i>both</i> Ashdod and its <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:27; Ps. 78:66">⚓</a>territory. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_5_7"><sup>7</sup>And when the men of Ashdod saw how <i>it</i> <i>was,</i> they said, “The ark of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:46, 47">⚓</a>God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand is harsh toward us and Dagon our god.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_5_8"><sup>8</sup>Therefore they sent and gathered to themselves all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 6:5">⚓</a>lords of the Philistines, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?”<br/> And they answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried away to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 6:4">⚓</a>Gath.” So they carried the ark of the God of Israel away. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_5_9"><sup>9</sup>So it was, after they had carried it away, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 11:22">⚓</a>the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction; and He struck the men of the city, both small and great, and tumors broke out on them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_5_10"> <sup>10</sup>Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. So it was, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people!” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_5_11"><sup>11</sup>So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its own place, so that it does not kill us and our people.” For there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_5_12"><sup>12</sup>And the men who did not die were stricken with the tumors, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:15; 1 Sam. 5:11; 7:13; 12:15">⚓</a>cry of the city went up to heaven.<br/></span>
