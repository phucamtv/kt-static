<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>The Ark Returned to Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines seven months. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_2"><sup>2</sup>And the Philistines <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:16; Jer. 14:2">⚓</a>called for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? Tell us how we should send it to its place.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_3"> <sup>3</sup>So they said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:8; Ex. 7:11; Is. 2:6; 47:13; Dan. 2:2; 5:7">⚓</a>empty; but by all means return <i>it</i> to Him <i>with</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:15; Deut. 16:16">⚓</a>a trespass offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then they said, “What <i>is</i> the trespass offering which we shall return to Him?”<br/> They answered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 5:15, 16">⚓</a>“Five golden tumors and five golden rats, <i>according</i> <i>to</i> the number of the lords of the Philistines. For the same plague <i>was</i> on all of you and on your lords. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_5"><sup>5</sup>Therefore you shall make images of your tumors and images of your rats that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 5:6, 9, 12; 6:17">⚓</a>ravage the land, and you shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 5:6">⚓</a>give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:19; 1 Chr. 16:28, 29; Is. 42:12; Jer. 13:16; Mal. 2:2; Rev. 14:7">⚓</a>lighten His hand from you, from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 5:6, 11; Ps. 39:10">⚓</a>your gods, and from your land. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_6"><sup>6</sup>Why then do you harden your hearts <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 5:3, 4, 7">⚓</a>as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He did mighty things among them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:13; 8:15; 9:34; 14:17">⚓</a>did they not let the people go, that they might depart? </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_7"><sup>7</sup>Now therefore, make <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:31">⚓</a>a new cart, take two milk cows <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:3">⚓</a>which have never been yoked, and hitch the cows to the cart; and take their calves home, away from them. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_8"><sup>8</sup>Then take the ark of the Lord and set it on the cart; and put <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 19:2; Deut. 21:3, 4">⚓</a>the articles of gold which you are returning to Him <i>as</i> a trespass offering in a chest by its side. Then send it away, and let it go. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_9"><sup>9</sup>And watch: if it goes up the road to its own territory, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 6:4, 5">⚓</a>Beth Shemesh, <i>then</i> He has done us this great evil. But if not, then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:10; 21:16">⚓</a>we shall know that <i>it</i> <i>is</i> not His hand <i>that</i> struck us—it happened to us by chance.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then the men did so; they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_11"><sup>11</sup>And they set the ark of the Lord on the cart, and the chest with the gold rats and the images of their tumors. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_12"><sup>12</sup>Then the cows headed straight for the road to Beth Shemesh, <i>and</i> went along the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 6:3">⚓</a>highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right hand or the left. And the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth Shemesh.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now <i>the</i> <i>people</i> <i>of</i> Beth Shemesh <i>were</i> reaping their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:19">⚓</a>wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_14"><sup>14</sup>Then the cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and stood there; a large stone <i>was</i> there. So they split the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_15"><sup>15</sup>The Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the chest that <i>was</i> with it, in which <i>were</i> the articles of gold, and put <i>them</i> on the large stone. Then the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices the same day to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_16"><sup>16</sup>So when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:17">⚓</a>the five lords of the Philistines had seen <i>it,</i> they returned to Ekron the same day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 13:3; Judg. 3:3">⚓</a>These <i>are</i> the golden tumors which the Philistines returned <i>as</i> a trespass offering to the Lord: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 6:4">⚓</a>Gath, one for Ekron; </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_18"><sup>18</sup>and the golden rats, <i>according</i> <i>to</i> the number of all the cities of the Philistines <i>belonging</i> to the five lords, <i>both</i> fortified cities and country villages, even as far as the large <i>stone</i> <i>of</i> Abel on which they set the ark of the Lord, <i>which</i> <i>stone</i> <i>remains</i> to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 5:8">⚓</a>He struck the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord. He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:21; Num. 4:5, 15, 16, 20">⚓</a>struck fifty thousand and seventy men of the people, and the people lamented because the Lord had struck the people with a great slaughter.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Ark at Kirjath Jearim</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_20"> <sup>20</sup>And the men of Beth Shemesh said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:7">⚓</a>“Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God? And to whom shall it go up from us?” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_6_21"><sup>21</sup>So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:44, 45; Ps. 24:3, 4; Mal. 3:2; Rev. 6:17">⚓</a>Kirjath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have brought back the ark of the Lord; come down <i>and</i> take it up with you.”<br/></span>
