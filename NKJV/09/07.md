<span class="verse 1sa_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the men of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:17; 15:9, 60; 18:14; Judg. 18:12; 1 Chr. 13:5, 6">⚓</a>Kirjath Jearim came and took the ark of the Lord, and brought it into the house of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 6:21; Ps. 132:6">⚓</a>Abinadab on the hill, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:3, 4">⚓</a>consecrated Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the Lord.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Samuel Judges Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_2"> <sup>2</sup>So it was that the ark remained in Kirjath Jearim a long time; it was there twenty years. And all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 21:8">⚓</a>return to the Lord with all your hearts, <i>then</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 30:2–10; 1 Kin. 8:48; Is. 55:7; Hos. 6:1; Joel 2:12–14">⚓</a>put away the foreign gods and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:2; Josh. 24:14, 23; Judg. 10:16">⚓</a>Ashtoreths from among you, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:13; 1 Sam. 31:10">⚓</a>prepare your hearts for the Lord, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:19; Job 11:13">⚓</a>serve Him only; and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_4"><sup>4</sup>So the children of Israel put away the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:13; 10:20; 13:4; Josh. 24:14; Matt. 4:10; Luke 4:8">⚓</a>Baals and the Ashtoreths, and served the Lord only.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_5"> <sup>5</sup>And Samuel said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:11; 10:16">⚓</a>“Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:17; 20:1; 1 Sam. 10:17">⚓</a>I will pray to the Lord for you.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_6"><sup>6</sup>So they gathered together at Mizpah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:17–19">⚓</a>drew water, and poured <i>it</i> out before the Lord. And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 14:14">⚓</a>fasted that day, and said there, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:26; Neh. 9:1, 2; Dan. 9:3–5; Joel 2:12">⚓</a>“We have sinned against the Lord.” And Samuel judged the children of Israel at Mizpah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel had gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard <i>of</i> <i>it,</i> they were afraid of the Philistines. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_8"><sup>8</sup>So the children of Israel said to Samuel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:10; 1 Sam. 12:10; 1 Kin. 8:47; Ps. 106:6">⚓</a>“Do not cease to cry out to the Lord our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_9"> <sup>9</sup>And Samuel took a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:19–24; Is. 37:4">⚓</a>suckling lamb and offered <i>it</i> <i>as</i> a whole burnt offering to the Lord. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 22:27">⚓</a>Samuel cried out to the Lord for Israel, and the Lord answered him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_10"><sup>10</sup>Now as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:18; Ps. 99:6; Jer. 15:1">⚓</a>But the Lord thundered with a loud thunder upon the Philistines that day, and so confused them that they were overcome before Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_11"><sup>11</sup>And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and drove them back as far as below Beth Car. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_12"><sup>12</sup>Then Samuel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:10; 2 Sam. 22:14, 15; Ps. 18:13, 14">⚓</a>took a stone and set <i>it</i> up between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer, saying, “Thus far the Lord has helped us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:18; 35:14; Josh. 4:9; 24:26">⚓</a>So the Philistines were subdued, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 13:1">⚓</a>did not come anymore into the territory of Israel. And the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_14"><sup>14</sup>Then the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel recovered its territory from the hands of the Philistines. Also there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_15"> <sup>15</sup>And Samuel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:5">⚓</a>judged Israel all the days of his life. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_16"><sup>16</sup>He went from year to year on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and judged Israel in all those places. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_7_17"><sup>17</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:11">⚓</a>he always returned to Ramah, for his home <i>was</i> there. There he judged Israel, and there he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:4">⚓</a>built an altar to the Lord.<br/></span>
