<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>Israel Demands a King</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass when Samuel was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 21:4">⚓</a>old that he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:2">⚓</a>made his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 16:18, 19; 2 Chr. 19:5">⚓</a>sons judges over Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_2"><sup>2</sup>The name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; <i>they</i> <i>were</i> judges in Beersheba. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_3"><sup>3</sup>But his sons <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:4">⚓</a>did not walk in his ways; they turned aside <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 22:15–17">⚓</a>after dishonest gain, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:21">⚓</a>took bribes, and perverted justice.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_5"><sup>5</sup>and said to him, “Look, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:6–8; Deut. 16:19; 1 Sam. 12:3">⚓</a>make us a king to judge us like all the nations.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_6"> <sup>6</sup>But the thing <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:14, 15; Hos. 13:10, 11; Acts 13:21">⚓</a>displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” So Samuel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:17">⚓</a>prayed to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_7"><sup>7</sup>And the Lord said to Samuel, “Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:9">⚓</a>they have not rejected you, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:8">⚓</a>they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_8"><sup>8</sup>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt, even to this day—with which they have forsaken Me and served other gods—so they are doing to you also. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_9"><sup>9</sup>Now therefore, heed their voice. However, you shall solemnly forewarn them, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:19">⚓</a>show them the behavior of the king who will reign over them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_10"> <sup>10</sup>So Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people who asked him for a king. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_11"><sup>11</sup>And he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:11–18">⚓</a>“This will be the behavior of the king who will reign over you: He will take your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:14–20">⚓</a>sons and appoint <i>them</i> for his own <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:52">⚓</a>chariots and <i>to</i> <i>be</i> his horsemen, and <i>some</i> will run before his chariots. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_12"><sup>12</sup>He will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:1">⚓</a>appoint captains over his thousands and captains over his fifties, <i>will</i> <i>set</i> <i>some</i> to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and <i>some</i> to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_13"><sup>13</sup>He will take your daughters <i>to</i> <i>be</i> perfumers, cooks, and bakers. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_14"><sup>14</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 22:7">⚓</a>he will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give <i>them</i> to his servants. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_15"><sup>15</sup>He will take a tenth of your grain and your vintage, and give it to his officers and servants. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_16"><sup>16</sup>And he will take your male servants, your female servants, your finest young men, and your donkeys, and put <i>them</i> to his work. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_17"><sup>17</sup>He will take a tenth of your sheep. And you will be his servants. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_18"><sup>18</sup>And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:7; (Ezek. 46:18)">⚓</a>will not hear you in that day.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_19"> <sup>19</sup>Nevertheless the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 1:25–28; Is. 1:15; Mic. 3:4">⚓</a>refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No, but we will have a king over us, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_20"><sup>20</sup>that we also may be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 66:4; Jer. 44:16">⚓</a>like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_21"> <sup>21</sup>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he repeated them in the hearing of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_8_22"><sup>22</sup>So the Lord said to Samuel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:5">⚓</a>“Heed their voice, and make them a king.”<br/> And Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Every man go to his city.”<br/></span>
