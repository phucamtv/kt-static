<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>Saul Chosen to Be King</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>There was a man of Benjamin whose name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:7; Hos. 13:11">⚓</a>Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_2"><sup>2</sup>And he had a choice and handsome son whose name <i>was</i> Saul. <i>There</i> <i>was</i> not a more handsome person than he among the children of Israel. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:51; 1 Chr. 8:33; 9:36–39">⚓</a>From his shoulders upward <i>he</i> <i>was</i> taller than any of the people.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_3"> <sup>3</sup>Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. And Kish said to his son Saul, “Please take one of the servants with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_4"><sup>4</sup>So he passed through the mountains of Ephraim and through the land of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:23">⚓</a>Shalisha, but they did not find <i>them.</i> Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and <i>they</i> <i>were</i> not <i>there.</i> Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find <i>them.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_5"> <sup>5</sup>When they had come to the land of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:42">⚓</a>Zuph, Saul said to his servant who <i>was</i> with him, “Come, let <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:1">⚓</a>us return, lest my father cease <i>caring</i> about the donkeys and become worried about us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_6"> <sup>6</sup>And he said to him, “Look now, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> in this city <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:2">⚓</a>a man of God, and <i>he</i> <i>is</i> an honorable man; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:1; 1 Kin. 13:1; 2 Kin. 5:8">⚓</a>all that he says surely comes to pass. So let us go there; perhaps he can show us the way that we should go.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then Saul said to his servant, “But look, <i>if</i> we go, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:19">⚓</a>what shall we bring the man? For the bread in our vessels is all gone, and <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_8"> <sup>8</sup>And the servant answered Saul again and said, “Look, I have here at hand one-fourth of a shekel of silver. I will give <i>that</i> to the man of God, to tell us our way.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_9"><sup>9</sup>(Formerly in Israel, when a man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:18; 13:17; 1 Kin. 14:3; 2 Kin. 4:42; 8:8">⚓</a>went to inquire of God, he spoke thus: “Come, let us go to the seer”; for <i>he</i> <i>who</i> <i>is</i> now <i>called</i> a prophet was formerly called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:22">⚓</a>a seer.)<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God <i>was.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_11"> <sup>11</sup>As they went up the hill to the city, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:11; 2 Kin. 17:13; 1 Chr. 26:28; 29:29; 2 Chr. 16:7, 10; Is. 30:10; Amos 7:12">⚓</a>they met some young women going out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_12"> <sup>12</sup>And they answered them and said, “Yes, there he is, just ahead of you. Hurry now; for today he came to this city, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:11, 15; 29:8, 9; Ex. 2:16">⚓</a>there is a sacrifice of the people today <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:54; 1 Sam. 16:2">⚓</a>on the high place. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_13"><sup>13</sup>As soon as you come into the city, you will surely find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now therefore, go up, for about this time you will find him.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_14"><sup>14</sup>So they went up to the city. As they were coming into the city, there was Samuel, coming out toward them on his way up to the high place.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:17; 10:5; 1 Kin. 3:2">⚓</a>Now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear the day before Saul came, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_16"><sup>16</sup>“Tomorrow about this time <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:1">⚓</a>I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:15">⚓</a>and you shall anoint him commander over My people Israel, that he may save My people from the hand of the Philistines; for I have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:1">⚓</a>looked upon My people, because their cry has come to Me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_17"> <sup>17</sup>So when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:23–25; 3:7, 9">⚓</a>“There he is, the man of whom I spoke to you. This one shall reign over My people.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_18"><sup>18</sup>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, “Please tell me, where <i>is</i> the seer’s house?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_19"> <sup>19</sup>Samuel answered Saul and said, “I <i>am</i> the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and tomorrow I will let you go and will tell you all that <i>is</i> in your heart. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_20"><sup>20</sup>But as for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:12; Hos. 13:11">⚓</a>your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not be anxious about them, for they have been found. And on whom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:3">⚓</a><i>is</i> all the desire of Israel? <i>Is</i> <i>it</i> not on you and on all your father’s house?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_21"> <sup>21</sup>And Saul answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:5, 19; 12:13">⚓</a>“<i>Am</i> I not a Benjamite, of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:17">⚓</a>smallest of the tribes of Israel, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:46–48; Ps. 68:27">⚓</a>my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then do you speak like this to me?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_22"> <sup>22</sup>Now Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and had them sit in the place of honor among those who were invited; there <i>were</i> about thirty persons. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_23"><sup>23</sup>And Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, ‘Set it apart.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_24"><sup>24</sup>So the cook took up <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:15">⚓</a>the thigh with its upper part and set <i>it</i> before Saul. And <i>Samuel</i> said, “Here it is, what was kept back. <i>It</i> was set apart for you. Eat; for until this time it has been kept for you, since I said I invited the people.” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_25"> <sup>25</sup>When they had come down from the high place into the city, <i>Samuel</i> spoke with Saul on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:22, 27; Lev. 7:32, 33; Num. 18:18; Ezek. 24:4">⚓</a>the top of the house. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_26"><sup>26</sup>They arose early; and it was about the dawning of the day that Samuel called to Saul on the top of the house, saying, “Get up, that I may send you on your way.” And Saul arose, and both of them went outside, he and Samuel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Saul Anointed King</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_9_27"> <sup>27</sup>As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.” And he went on. “But you stand here awhile, that I may announce to you the word of God.”<br/></span>
