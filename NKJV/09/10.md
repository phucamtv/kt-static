<span class="verse 1sa_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 22:8; 2 Sam. 11:2; Luke 5:19; Acts 10:9">⚓</a>Samuel took a flask of oil and poured <i>it</i> on his head, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:23–33; 1 Sam. 9:16; 16:13; 2 Kin. 9:3, 6">⚓</a>and kissed him and said: “<i>Is</i> <i>it</i> not because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:12">⚓</a>the Lord has anointed you commander over <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:2; Acts 13:21">⚓</a>His inheritance? </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_2"><sup>2</sup>When you have departed from me today, you will find two men by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:9; Deut. 32:9; Ps. 78:71">⚓</a>Rachel’s tomb in the territory of Benjamin <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:16–20; 48:7">⚓</a>at Zelzah; and they will say to you, ‘The donkeys which you went to look for have been found. And now your father has ceased caring about the donkeys and is worrying about <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:28">⚓</a>you, saying, “What shall I do about my son?” ’ </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_3"><sup>3</sup>Then you shall go on forward from there and come to the terebinth tree of Tabor. There three men going up <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:3–5">⚓</a>to God at Bethel will meet you, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_4"><sup>4</sup>And they will greet you and give you two <i>loaves</i> of bread, which you shall receive from their hands. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_5"><sup>5</sup>After that you shall come to the hill of God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:22; 35:1, 3, 7">⚓</a>where the Philistine garrison <i>is.</i> And it will happen, when you have come there to the city, that you will meet a group of prophets coming down <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:2, 3">⚓</a>from the high place with a stringed instrument, a tambourine, a flute, and a harp before them; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:12, 20; 2 Kin. 2:3, 5, 15">⚓</a>and they will be prophesying. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_6"><sup>6</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:20, 21; 2 Kin. 3:15; 1 Chr. 25:1–6; 1 Cor. 14:1">⚓</a>the Spirit of the Lord will come upon you, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:25, 29; Judg. 14:6; 1 Sam. 16:13">⚓</a>you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_7"><sup>7</sup>And let it be, when these <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:10; 19:23, 24">⚓</a>signs come to you, <i>that</i> you do as the occasion demands; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:8; Luke 2:12">⚓</a>God <i>is</i> with you. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_8"><sup>8</sup>You shall go down before me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:5; Judg. 6:12; 1 Sam. 3:19; (Heb. 13:5)">⚓</a>to Gilgal; and surely I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings <i>and</i> make sacrifices of peace offerings. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 11:14, 15; 13:8">⚓</a>Seven days you shall wait, till I come to you and show you what you should do.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_9"> <sup>9</sup>So it was, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, that God gave him another heart; and all those signs came to pass that day. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:8–10">⚓</a>When they came there to the hill, there was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:5">⚓</a>a group of prophets to meet him; then the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_11"><sup>11</sup>And it happened, when all who knew him formerly saw that he indeed prophesied among the prophets, that the people said to one another, “What <i>is</i> this <i>that</i> has come upon the son of Kish? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:20">⚓</a><i>Is</i> Saul also among the prophets?” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_12"><sup>12</sup>Then a man from there answered and said, “But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:24; Amos 7:14, 15; Matt. 13:54–57; John 7:15; Acts 4:13">⚓</a>who <i>is</i> their father?” Therefore it became a proverb: “<i>Is</i> Saul also among the prophets?” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_13"><sup>13</sup>And when he had finished prophesying, he went to the high place.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then Saul’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 5:30, 36">⚓</a>uncle said to him and his servant, “Where did you go?”<br/> So he said, “To look for the donkeys. When we saw that <i>they</i> <i>were</i> nowhere <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>found,</i> we went to Samuel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_15"> <sup>15</sup>And Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me, please, what Samuel said to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_16"> <sup>16</sup>So Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys had been <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:50">⚓</a>found.” But about the matter of the kingdom, he did not tell him what Samuel had said.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Saul Proclaimed King</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Samuel called the people together <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:20">⚓</a>to the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:1">⚓</a>at Mizpah, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_18"><sup>18</sup>and said to the children of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:5, 6">⚓</a>“Thus says the Lord God of Israel: ‘I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians <i>and</i> from the hand of all kingdoms and from those who oppressed you.’ </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:8, 9; 1 Sam. 8:8; 12:6, 8">⚓</a>But you have today rejected your God, who Himself saved you from all your adversities and your tribulations; and you have said to Him, ‘No, set a king over us!’ Now therefore, present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and by your clans.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_20"> <sup>20</sup>And when Samuel had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:7, 19; 12:12">⚓</a>caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_21"><sup>21</sup>When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was chosen. And Saul the son of Kish was chosen. But when they sought him, he could not be found. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_22"><sup>22</sup>Therefore they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:24, 26">⚓</a>inquired of the Lord further, “Has the man come here yet?”<br/> And the Lord answered, “There he is, hidden among the equipment.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_23"> <sup>23</sup>So they ran and brought him from there; and when he stood among the people, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 23:2, 4, 10, 11">⚓</a>he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_24"><sup>24</sup>And Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:2">⚓</a>whom the Lord has chosen, that <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no one like him among all the people?”<br/> So all the people shouted and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:15; 1 Sam. 9:16; 2 Sam. 21:6">⚓</a>“Long live the king!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Samuel explained to the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:25, 39">⚓</a>the behavior of royalty, and wrote <i>it</i> in a book and laid <i>it</i> up before the Lord. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_26"><sup>26</sup>And Saul also went home <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:14–20; 1 Sam. 8:11–18">⚓</a>to Gibeah; and valiant <i>men</i> went with him, whose hearts God had touched. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_10_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:14">⚓</a>But some <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 11:12">⚓</a>rebels said, “How can this man save us?” So they despised him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:13; 1 Sam. 25:17">⚓</a>and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.<br/></span>
