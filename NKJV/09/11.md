<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>Saul Saves Jabesh Gilead</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:2; 1 Kin. 4:21; 10:25; 2 Chr. 17:5; Matt. 2:11">⚓</a>Nahash the Ammonite came up and encamped against <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:12">⚓</a>Jabesh Gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 21:8; 1 Sam. 31:11">⚓</a>“Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_2"> <sup>2</sup>And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, “On this <i>condition</i> I will make <i>a</i> <i>covenant</i> with you, that I may put out all your right eyes, and bring <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 26:28; 1 Kin. 20:34; Job 41:4; Ezek. 17:13">⚓</a>reproach on all Israel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then the elders of Jabesh said to him, “Hold off for seven days, that we may send messengers to all the territory of Israel. And then, if <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no one to save us, we will come out to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_4"> <sup>4</sup>So the messengers came <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:14; 1 Sam. 17:26; Ps. 44:13">⚓</a>to Gibeah of Saul and told the news in the hearing of the people. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:26; 15:34; 2 Sam. 21:6">⚓</a>all the people lifted up their voices and wept. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_5"><sup>5</sup>Now there was Saul, coming behind the herd from the field; and Saul said, “What <i>troubles</i> the people, that they weep?” And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:38; Judg. 2:4; 20:23, 26; 21:2; 1 Sam. 30:4">⚓</a>Then the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard this news, and his anger was greatly aroused. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_7"><sup>7</sup>So he took a yoke of oxen and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 13:25; 14:6; 1 Sam. 10:10; 16:13">⚓</a>cut them in pieces, and sent <i>them</i> throughout all the territory of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:29">⚓</a>“Whoever does not go out with Saul and Samuel to battle, so it shall be done to his oxen.”<br/> And the fear of the Lord fell on the people, and they came out with one consent. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_8"><sup>8</sup>When he numbered them in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 21:5, 8, 10">⚓</a>Bezek, the children <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:5">⚓</a>of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_9"><sup>9</sup>And they said to the messengers who came, “Thus you shall say to the men of Jabesh Gilead: ‘Tomorrow, by <i>the</i> <i>time</i> the sun is hot, you shall have help.’ ” Then the messengers came and reported <i>it</i> to the men of Jabesh, and they were glad. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_10"><sup>10</sup>Therefore the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you may do with us whatever seems good to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_11"> <sup>11</sup>So it was, on the next day, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:9">⚓</a>Saul put the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:11">⚓</a>in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and killed Ammonites until the heat of the day. And it happened that those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then the people said to Samuel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:16, 20">⚓</a>“Who <i>is</i> he who said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:27">⚓</a>Bring the men, that we may put them to death.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_13"> <sup>13</sup>But Saul said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 19:27">⚓</a>“Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:27; 2 Sam. 19:22">⚓</a>the Lord has accomplished salvation in Israel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:13, 30; 1 Sam. 19:5">⚓</a>to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_11_15"><sup>15</sup>So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:16; 10:8">⚓</a>before the Lord in Gilgal. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:17">⚓</a>There they made sacrifices of peace offerings before the Lord, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.<br/></span>
