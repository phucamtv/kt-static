<div class="title"><h1>13</h1><h3>Saul’s Unlawful Sacrifice</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_2"><sup>2</sup>Saul chose for himself three thousand <i>men</i> of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:36">⚓</a>Michmash and in the mountains of Bethel, and a thousand were with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:5, 31">⚓</a>Jonathan in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:1">⚓</a>Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent away, every man to his tent.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_3"> <sup>3</sup>And Jonathan attacked <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:26">⚓</a>the garrison of the Philistines that <i>was</i> in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:5">⚓</a>Geba, and the Philistines heard <i>of</i> <i>it.</i> Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_4"><sup>4</sup>Now all Israel heard it said <i>that</i> Saul had attacked a garrison of the Philistines, and <i>that</i> Israel had also become an abomination to the Philistines. And the people were called together to Saul at Gilgal.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the Philistines gathered together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen, and people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:25">⚓</a>as the sand which <i>is</i> on the seashore in multitude. And they came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:12">⚓</a>Beth Aven. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_6"><sup>6</sup>When the men of Israel saw that they were in danger (for the people were distressed), then the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:2; 1 Sam. 14:23">⚓</a>hid in caves, in thickets, in rocks, in holes, and in pits. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_7"><sup>7</sup>And <i>some</i> <i>of</i> the Hebrews crossed over the Jordan to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:2; 1 Sam. 14:11">⚓</a>land of Gad and Gilead.<br/> As for Saul, he <i>was</i> still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:1–42">⚓</a>Then he waited seven days, according to the time set by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_9"><sup>9</sup>So Saul said, “Bring a burnt offering and peace offerings here to me.” And he offered the burnt offering. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_10"><sup>10</sup>Now it happened, as soon as he had finished presenting the burnt offering, that Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_11"> <sup>11</sup>And Samuel said, “What have you done?”<br/> Saul said, “When I saw that the people were scattered from me, and <i>that</i> you did not come within the days appointed, and <i>that</i> the Philistines gathered together at Michmash, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_12"><sup>12</sup>then I said, ‘The Philistines will now come down on me at Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the Lord.’ Therefore I felt compelled, and offered a burnt offering.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_13"> <sup>13</sup>And Samuel said to Saul, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:8">⚓</a>“You have done foolishly. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 16:9">⚓</a>You have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God, which He commanded you. For now the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:11, 22, 28">⚓</a>But now your kingdom shall not continue. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:28; 31:6">⚓</a>The Lord has sought for Himself a man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:1">⚓</a>after His own heart, and the Lord has commanded him <i>to</i> <i>be</i> commander over His people, because you have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 89:20; Acts 7:46; 13:22">⚓</a>not kept what the Lord commanded you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people present with him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:11, 19">⚓</a>about six hundred men.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>No Weapons for the Army</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_16"> <sup>16</sup>Saul, Jonathan his son, and the people present with them remained in Gibeah of Benjamin. But the Philistines encamped in Michmash. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_17"><sup>17</sup>Then raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies. One company turned onto the road to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:2, 6, 7; 14:2">⚓</a>Ophrah, to the land of Shual, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_18"><sup>18</sup>another company turned to the road <i>to</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:23">⚓</a>Beth Horon, and another company turned <i>to</i> the road of the border that overlooks the Valley of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:3; 18:13, 14">⚓</a>Zeboim toward the wilderness.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_19"> <sup>19</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:2; Neh. 11:34">⚓</a>there was no blacksmith to be found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_20"><sup>20</sup>But all the Israelites would go down to the Philistines to sharpen each man’s plowshare, his mattock, his ax, and his sickle; </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_21"><sup>21</sup>and the charge for a sharpening was a pim for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to set the points of the goads. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_22"><sup>22</sup>So it came about, on the day of battle, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:8; 2 Kin. 24:14; Jer. 24:1; 29:2">⚓</a>there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who <i>were</i> with Saul and Jonathan. But they were found with Saul and Jonathan his son.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_13_23"> <sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:8">⚓</a>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.<br/></span>
