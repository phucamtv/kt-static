<div class="title"><h1>14</h1><h3>Jonathan Defeats the Philistines</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it happened one day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison that <i>is</i> on the other side.” But he did not tell his father. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_2"><sup>2</sup>And Saul was sitting in the outskirts of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:1, 4">⚓</a>Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which <i>is</i> in Migron. The people who <i>were</i> with him <i>were</i> about six hundred men. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:15, 16">⚓</a>Ahijah the son of Ahitub, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 22:9, 11, 20">⚓</a>Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the Lord’s priest in Shiloh, was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 4:21">⚓</a>wearing an ephod. But the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_4"> <sup>4</sup>Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:28">⚓</a>to the Philistines’ garrison, <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a sharp rock on one side and a sharp rock on the other side. And the name of one <i>was</i> Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_5"><sup>5</sup>The front of one faced northward opposite Michmash, and the other southward opposite Gibeah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:23">⚓</a>uncircumcised; it may be that the Lord will work for us. For nothing restrains the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:26, 36; Jer. 9:25, 26">⚓</a>from saving by many or by few.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_7"> <sup>7</sup>So his armorbearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Go then; here I am with you, according to your heart.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Jonathan said, “Very well, let us cross over to <i>these</i> men, and we will show ourselves to them. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_9"><sup>9</sup>If they say thus to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand still in our place and not go up to them. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_10"><sup>10</sup>But if they say thus, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up. For the Lord has delivered them into our hand, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:4, 7; 1 Sam. 17:46, 47; 2 Chr. 14:11; (Ps. 115:3; 135:6; Zech. 4:6; Matt. 19:26; Rom. 8:31)">⚓</a>this <i>will</i> <i>be</i> a sign to us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_11"> <sup>11</sup>So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, “Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:14; Judg. 6:36–40">⚓</a>hidden.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_12"><sup>12</sup>Then the men of the garrison called to Jonathan and his armorbearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you something.”<br/> Jonathan said to his armorbearer, “Come up after me, for the Lord has delivered them into the hand of Israel.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_13"><sup>13</sup>And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and knees with his armorbearer after him; and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:6; 14:22">⚓</a>fell before Jonathan. And as he came after him, his armorbearer killed them. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_14"><sup>14</sup>That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armorbearer made was about twenty men within about half an acre of land.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_15"> <sup>15</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:8; Josh. 23:10">⚓</a>there was trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:7; 2 Kin. 7:6, 7; Job 18:11">⚓</a>the raiders also trembled; and the earth quaked, so that it was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:17">⚓</a>a very great trembling. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_16"><sup>16</sup>Now the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and <i>there</i> was the multitude, melting away; and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:5">⚓</a>went here and there. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_17"><sup>17</sup>Then Saul said to the people who <i>were</i> with him, “Now call the roll and see who has gone from us.” And when they had called the roll, surprisingly, Jonathan and his armorbearer <i>were</i> not <i>there.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_18"><sup>18</sup>And Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here” (for at that time the ark of God was with the children of Israel). </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_19"><sup>19</sup>Now it happened, while Saul <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:20">⚓</a>talked to the priest, that the noise which <i>was</i> in the camp of the Philistines continued to increase; so Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_20"><sup>20</sup>Then Saul and all the people who <i>were</i> with him assembled, and they went to the battle; and indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:21">⚓</a>every man’s sword was against his neighbor, <i>and</i> <i>there</i> <i>was</i> very great confusion. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_21"><sup>21</sup>Moreover the Hebrews <i>who</i> were with the Philistines before that time, who went up with them into the camp <i>from</i> <i>the</i> surrounding <i>country,</i> they also joined the Israelites who <i>were</i> with Saul and Jonathan. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_22"><sup>22</sup>Likewise all the men of Israel who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:22; 2 Chr. 20:23">⚓</a>had hidden in the mountains of Ephraim, <i>when</i> they heard that the Philistines fled, they also followed hard after them in the battle. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:6">⚓</a>So the Lord saved Israel that day, and the battle shifted <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:30; 2 Chr. 32:22; Hos. 1:7">⚓</a>to Beth Aven.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Saul’s Rash Oath</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_24"> <sup>24</sup>And the men of Israel were distressed that day, for Saul had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:5">⚓</a>placed the people under oath, saying, “Cursed <i>is</i> the man who eats <i>any</i> food until evening, before I have taken vengeance on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_25"><sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 6:26">⚓</a>Now all <i>the</i> <i>people</i> of the land came to a forest; and there was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:28; Matt. 3:5">⚓</a>honey on the ground. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_26"><sup>26</sup>And when the people had come into the woods, there was the honey, dripping; but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_27"><sup>27</sup>But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath; therefore he stretched out the end of the rod that <i>was</i> in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his countenance brightened. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_28"><sup>28</sup>Then one of the people said, “Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed <i>is</i> the man who eats food this day.’ ” And the people were faint.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_29"> <sup>29</sup>But Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. Look now, how my countenance has brightened because I tasted a little of this honey. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_30"><sup>30</sup>How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now would there not have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_31"> <sup>31</sup>Now they had driven back the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. So the people were very faint. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_32"><sup>32</sup>And the people rushed on the spoil, and took sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered <i>them</i> on the ground; and the people ate <i>them</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:8; Num. 13:27; Matt. 3:4">⚓</a>with the blood. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_33"><sup>33</sup>Then they told Saul, saying, “Look, the people are sinning against the Lord by eating with the blood!”<br/> So he said, “You have dealt treacherously; roll a large stone to me this day.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_34"><sup>34</sup>Then Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, ‘Bring me here every man’s ox and every man’s sheep, slaughter <i>them</i> here, and eat; and do not sin against the Lord by eating with the blood.’ ” So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night, and slaughtered <i>it</i> there. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_35"><sup>35</sup>Then Saul <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:4; Lev. 3:17; 17:10–14; 19:26; Deut. 12:16, 23, 24; Acts 15:20">⚓</a>built an altar to the Lord. This was the first altar that he built to the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_36"> <sup>36</sup>Now Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and plunder them until the morning light; and let us not leave a man of them.”<br/> And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.”<br/> Then the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_37"> <sup>37</sup>So Saul <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:12, 17; 2 Sam. 24:25">⚓</a>asked counsel of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:18">⚓</a>He did not answer him that day. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_38"><sup>38</sup>And Saul said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 28:6">⚓</a>“Come over here, all you chiefs of the people, and know and see what this sin was today. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_39"><sup>39</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:14; 1 Sam. 10:19">⚓</a><i>as</i> the Lord lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But not a man among all the people answered him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_40"><sup>40</sup>Then he said to all Israel, “You be on one side, and my son Jonathan and I will be on the other side.”<br/> And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_41"> <sup>41</sup>Therefore Saul said to the Lord God of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:24, 44; 2 Sam. 12:5">⚓</a>“Give a perfect <i>lot.</i>” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 16:33; Acts 1:24–26">⚓</a>So Saul and Jonathan were taken, but the people escaped. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_42"><sup>42</sup>And Saul said, “Cast <i>lots</i> between my son Jonathan and me.” So Jonathan was taken. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_43"><sup>43</sup>Then Saul said to Jonathan, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:16; 1 Sam. 10:20, 21">⚓</a>“Tell me what you have done.”<br/> And Jonathan told him, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:19">⚓</a>“I only tasted a little honey with the end of the rod that <i>was</i> in my hand. So now I must die!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_44"> <sup>44</sup>Saul answered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:27">⚓</a>“God do so and more also; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:17; 1 Sam. 25:22">⚓</a>for you shall surely die, Jonathan.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_45"> <sup>45</sup>But the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has accomplished this great deliverance in Israel? Certainly not! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:39">⚓</a>As the Lord lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for he has worked <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 14:11; 1 Kin. 1:52; Luke 21:18; Acts 27:34">⚓</a>with God this day.” So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_46"> <sup>46</sup>Then Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Saul’s Continuing Wars</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_47"> <sup>47</sup>So Saul established his sovereignty over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the people of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 6:1; Phil. 2:12, 13)">⚓</a>Ammon, against Edom, against the kings of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 11:1–13">⚓</a>Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he harassed <i>them.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_48"><sup>48</sup>And he gathered an army and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 10:6">⚓</a>attacked the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_49"> <sup>49</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:16; 1 Sam. 15:3–7">⚓</a>The sons of Saul were Jonathan, Jishui, and Malchishua. And the names of his two daughters <i>were</i> <i>these:</i> the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:2; 1 Chr. 8:33">⚓</a>Michal. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_50"><sup>50</sup>The name of Saul’s wife <i>was</i> Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army <i>was</i> Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:17–20, 27; 19:12">⚓</a>uncle. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_51"><sup>51</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:14">⚓</a>Kish <i>was</i> the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner <i>was</i> the son of Abiel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_14_52"> <sup>52</sup>Now there was fierce war with the Philistines all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any strong man or any valiant man, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:1, 21">⚓</a>he took him for himself.<br/></span>
