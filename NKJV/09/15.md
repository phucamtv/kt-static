<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>Saul Spares King Agag</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>Samuel also said to Saul, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:11">⚓</a>“The Lord sent me to anoint you king over His people, over Israel. Now therefore, heed the voice of the words of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_2"><sup>2</sup>Thus says the Lord of hosts: ‘I will punish Amalek <i>for</i> what he did to Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:16; 10:1">⚓</a>how he ambushed him on the way when he came up from Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_3"><sup>3</sup>Now go and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:8, 14; Num. 24:20; Deut. 25:17–19">⚓</a>attack Amalek, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 25:19">⚓</a>utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them. But kill both man and woman, infant and nursing child, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_4"> <sup>4</sup>So Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_5"><sup>5</sup>And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and lay in wait in the valley.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then Saul said to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 27:28, 29; Num. 24:20; Deut. 20:16–18; Josh. 6:17–21">⚓</a>the Kenites, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 24:21; Judg. 1:16; 4:11–22; 1 Chr. 2:55">⚓</a>“Go, depart, get down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them. For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:25; 19:12, 14; Rev. 18:4">⚓</a>you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:10, 19; Num. 10:29, 32">⚓</a>And Saul attacked the Amalekites, from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:48">⚓</a>Havilah all the way to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:11; 25:17, 18">⚓</a>Shur, which is east of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:7; Ex. 15:22; 1 Sam. 27:8">⚓</a>He also took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:32, 33">⚓</a>utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_9"><sup>9</sup>But Saul and the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 27:8, 9">⚓</a>spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all <i>that</i> <i>was</i> good, and were unwilling to utterly destroy them. But everything despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Saul Rejected as King</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:3, 15, 19">⚓</a>“I greatly regret that I have set up Saul <i>as</i> king, for he has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 6:6, 7; 1 Sam. 15:35; 2 Sam. 24:16">⚓</a>turned back from following Me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 22:16; 1 Kin. 9:6">⚓</a>and has not performed My commandments.” And it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:13; 15:3, 9">⚓</a>grieved Samuel, and he cried out to the Lord all night. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_12"><sup>12</sup>So when Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul, it was told Samuel, saying, “Saul went to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:35; 16:1">⚓</a>Carmel, and indeed, he set up a monument for himself; and he has gone on around, passed by, and gone down to Gilgal.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_13"><sup>13</sup>Then Samuel went to Saul, and Saul said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:55; 1 Sam. 25:2">⚓</a>“Blessed <i>are</i> you of the Lord! I have performed the commandment of the Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_14"> <sup>14</sup>But Samuel said, “What then <i>is</i> this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_15"> <sup>15</sup>And Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:19; Judg. 17:2; Ruth 3:10; 2 Sam. 2:5">⚓</a>for the people spared the best of the sheep and the oxen, to sacrifice to the Lord your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then Samuel said to Saul, “Be quiet! And I will tell you what the Lord said to me last night.”<br/> And he said to him, “Speak on.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_17"> <sup>17</sup>So Samuel said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 3:12, 13; Ex. 32:22, 23); 1 Sam. 15:9, 21; (Prov. 28:13)">⚓</a>“When you <i>were</i> little in your own eyes, <i>were</i> you not head of the tribes of Israel? And did not the Lord anoint you king over Israel? </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_18"><sup>18</sup>Now the Lord sent you on a mission, and said, ‘Go, and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’ </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_19"><sup>19</sup>Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord? Why did you swoop down on the spoil, and do evil in the sight of the Lord?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_20"> <sup>20</sup>And Saul said to Samuel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:21; 10:22">⚓</a>“But I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, and gone on the mission on which the Lord sent me, and brought back Agag king of Amalek; I have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:13; (Prov. 28:13)">⚓</a>But the people took of the plunder, sheep and oxen, the best of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the Lord your God in Gilgal.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_22"> <sup>22</sup>So Samuel said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:15">⚓</a>“Has the Lord<i>as</i> <i>great</i> delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices,<br/>   As in obeying the voice of the Lord?<br/>   Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 50:8, 9; 51:16, 17; (Prov. 21:3; Is. 1:11–17; Jer. 7:22, 23; Mic. 6:6–8; Heb. 10:4–10)">⚓</a>to obey is better than sacrifice,<br/>   <i>And</i> to heed than the fat of rams.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_23">   <sup>23</sup>For rebellion <i>is</i> <i>as</i> the sin of witchcraft,<br/>   And stubbornness <i>is</i> <i>as</i> iniquity and idolatry.<br/>   Because you have rejected the word of the Lord,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eccl. 5:1; Hos. 6:6; Matt. 5:24; 9:13; 12:7; Mark 12:33)">⚓</a>He also has rejected you from <i>being</i> king.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_24"> <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:14; 16:1">⚓</a>Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord and your words, because I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:34; Josh. 7:20; 1 Sam. 26:21; 2 Sam. 12:13; Ps. 51:4">⚓</a>feared the people and obeyed their voice. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_25"><sup>25</sup>Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and return with me, that I may worship the Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_26"> <sup>26</sup>But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 23:2; Prov. 29:25; Is. 51:12, 13)">⚓</a>for you have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_27"> <sup>27</sup>And as Samuel turned around to go away, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:30">⚓</a><i>Saul</i> seized the edge of his robe, and it tore. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_28"><sup>28</sup>So Samuel said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:30, 31">⚓</a>“The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, <i>who</i> <i>is</i> better than you. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_29"><sup>29</sup>And also the Strength of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 28:17, 18; 1 Kin. 11:31">⚓</a>will not lie nor relent. For He <i>is</i> not a man, that He should relent.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_30"> <sup>30</sup>Then he said, “I have sinned; <i>yet</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:19; Ezek. 24:14; 2 Tim. 2:13; Titus 1:2">⚓</a>honor me now, please, before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the Lord your God.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_31"><sup>31</sup>So Samuel turned back after Saul, and Saul worshiped the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_32"> <sup>32</sup>Then Samuel said, “Bring Agag king of the Amalekites here to me.” So Agag came to him cautiously.<br/> And Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_33"> <sup>33</sup>But Samuel said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 5:44; 12:43)">⚓</a>“As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.” And Samuel hacked Agag in pieces before the Lord in Gilgal.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_34"> <sup>34</sup>Then Samuel went to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 9:6); Num. 14:45; Judg. 1:7; (Matt. 7:2)">⚓</a>Ramah, and Saul went up to his house at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:17">⚓</a>Gibeah of Saul. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_15_35"><sup>35</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 11:4">⚓</a>Samuel went no more to see Saul until the day of his death. Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul, and the Lord regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel.<br/></span>
