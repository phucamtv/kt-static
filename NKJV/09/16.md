<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>David Anointed King</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the Lord said to Samuel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:24">⚓</a>“How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:23, 35">⚓</a>Fill your horn with oil, and go; I am sending you to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:16; 10:1; 2 Kin. 9:1">⚓</a>Jesse the Bethlehemite. For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 4:18–22">⚓</a>I have provided Myself a king among his sons.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_2"> <sup>2</sup>And Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears <i>it,</i> he will kill me.”<br/> But the Lord said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:70, 71; Acts 13:22">⚓</a>‘I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.’ </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_3"><sup>3</sup>Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; you shall anoint for Me the one I name to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_4"> <sup>4</sup>So Samuel did what the Lord said, and went to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:12">⚓</a>trembled at his coming, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 21:1">⚓</a>“Do you come peaceably?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_5"> <sup>5</sup>And he said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:13; 2 Kin. 9:22">⚓</a>Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_6"> <sup>6</sup>So it was, when they came, that he looked at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:2; Ex. 19:10">⚓</a>Eliab and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:13, 28">⚓</a>said, “Surely the Lord’s anointed <i>is</i> before Him!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_7"> <sup>7</sup>But the Lord said to Samuel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:26">⚓</a>“Do not look at his appearance or at his physical stature, because I have refused him. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 147:10">⚓</a>For <i>the</i> <i>Lord</i> <i>does</i> not <i>see</i> as man sees; for man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 55:8, 9">⚓</a>looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 10:7">⚓</a>heart.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_8"> <sup>8</sup>So Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, “Neither has the Lord chosen this one.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_9"><sup>9</sup>Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, “Neither has the Lord chosen this one.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_10"><sup>10</sup>Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, “The Lord has not chosen these.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_11"><sup>11</sup>And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all the young men here?” Then he said, “There remains yet the youngest, and there he is, keeping the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:39">⚓</a>sheep.”<br/> And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him. For we will not sit down till he comes here.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_12"><sup>12</sup>So he sent and brought him in. Now he <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:8; Ps. 78:70–72">⚓</a>ruddy, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:42">⚓</a>with bright eyes, and good-looking. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:6; Ex. 2:2; Acts 7:20">⚓</a>And the Lord said, “Arise, anoint him; for this <i>is</i> the one!” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_13"><sup>13</sup>Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:17">⚓</a>the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose and went to Ramah.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Distressing Spirit Troubles Saul</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:18; 1 Sam. 10:6, 9, 10">⚓</a>But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 16:20; 1 Sam. 11:6; 18:12; 28:15">⚓</a>a distressing spirit from the Lord troubled him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_15"><sup>15</sup>And Saul’s servants said to him, “Surely, a distressing spirit from God is troubling you. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_16"><sup>16</sup>Let our master now command your servants, <i>who</i> <i>are</i> before you, to seek out a man <i>who</i> <i>is</i> a skillful player on the harp. And it shall be that he will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:23; 1 Sam. 16:15, 16; 18:10; 19:9; 1 Kin. 22:19–22">⚓</a>play it with his hand when the distressing spirit from God is upon you, and you shall be well.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_17"> <sup>17</sup>So Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring <i>him</i> to me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then one of the servants answered and said, “Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, <i>who</i> <i>is</i> skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:10; 19:9; 2 Kin. 3:15">⚓</a>the Lord<i>is</i> with him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_19"> <sup>19</sup>Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me your son David, who <i>is</i> with the sheep.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_20"><sup>20</sup>And Jesse <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:19; 18:12, 14">⚓</a>took a donkey <i>loaded</i> <i>with</i> bread, a skin of wine, and a young goat, and sent <i>them</i> by his son David to Saul. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_21"><sup>21</sup>So David came to Saul and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:4, 27; Prov. 18:16">⚓</a>stood before him. And he loved him greatly, and he became his armorbearer. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_22"><sup>22</sup>Then Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_16_23"><sup>23</sup>And so it was, whenever the spirit from God was upon Saul, that David would take a harp and play <i>it</i> with his hand. Then Saul would become refreshed and well, and the distressing spirit would depart from him.<br/></span>
