<div class="title"><h1>17</h1><h3>David and Goliath</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the Philistines gathered their armies together to battle, and were gathered at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:46; Prov. 22:29">⚓</a>Sochoh, which <i>belongs</i> to Judah; they encamped between Sochoh and Azekah, in Ephes Dammim. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_2"><sup>2</sup>And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and they encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in battle array against the Philistines. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_3"><sup>3</sup>The Philistines stood on a mountain on one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side, with a valley between them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_4"> <sup>4</sup>And a champion went out from the camp of the Philistines, named <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:35; 2 Chr. 28:18">⚓</a>Goliath, from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 21:19">⚓</a>Gath, whose height <i>was</i> six cubits and a span. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_5"><sup>5</sup><i>He</i> <i>had</i> a bronze helmet on his head, and he <i>was</i> armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat <i>was</i> five thousand shekels of bronze. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_6"><sup>6</sup>And <i>he</i> <i>had</i> bronze armor on his legs and a bronze javelin between his shoulders. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_7"><sup>7</sup>Now the staff of his spear <i>was</i> like a weaver’s beam, and his iron spearhead <i>weighed</i> six hundred shekels; and a shield-bearer went before him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_8"><sup>8</sup>Then he stood and cried out to the armies of Israel, and said to them, “Why have you come out to line up for battle? <i>Am</i> I not a Philistine, and you the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 11:21, 22">⚓</a>servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_9"><sup>9</sup>If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:17">⚓</a>serve us.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_10"><sup>10</sup>And the Philistine said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 11:1">⚓</a>“I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_11"><sup>11</sup>When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_12"> <sup>12</sup>Now David <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:26, 36, 45; 2 Sam. 21:21">⚓</a>the son of that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 4:22; 1 Sam. 16:1, 18; 17:58">⚓</a>Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name <i>was</i> Jesse, and who had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:19">⚓</a>eight sons. And the man was old, advanced <i>in</i> <i>years,</i> in the days of Saul. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_13"><sup>13</sup>The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone to follow Saul to the battle. The <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:10, 11; 1 Chr. 2:13–15">⚓</a>names of his three sons who went to the battle <i>were</i> Eliab the firstborn, next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_14"><sup>14</sup>David <i>was</i> the youngest. And the three oldest followed Saul. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_15"><sup>15</sup>But David occasionally went and returned from Saul <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:6, 8, 9; 1 Chr. 2:13">⚓</a>to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_16"> <sup>16</sup>And the Philistine drew near and presented himself forty days, morning and evening.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Jesse said to his son David, “Take now for your brothers an ephah of this dried <i>grain</i> and these ten loaves, and run to your brothers at the camp. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_18"><sup>18</sup>And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of <i>their</i> thousand, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:11, 19; 2 Sam. 7:8">⚓</a>see how your brothers fare, and bring back news of them.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_19"><sup>19</sup>Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel <i>were</i> in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_20"> <sup>20</sup>So David rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, and took <i>the</i> <i>things</i> and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the camp as the army was going out to the fight and shouting for the battle. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_21"><sup>21</sup>For Israel and the Philistines had drawn up in battle array, army against army. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_22"><sup>22</sup>And David left his supplies in the hand of the supply keeper, ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_23"><sup>23</sup>Then as he talked with them, there was the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, coming up from the armies of the Philistines; and he spoke <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:13, 14">⚓</a>according to the same words. So David heard <i>them.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_24"><sup>24</sup>And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were dreadfully afraid. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_25"><sup>25</sup>So the men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel; and it shall be <i>that</i> the man who kills him the king will enrich with great riches, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:8–10">⚓</a>will give him his daughter, and give his father’s house exemption <i>from</i> <i>taxes</i> in Israel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:16">⚓</a>the reproach from Israel? For who <i>is</i> this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 11:2">⚓</a>uncircumcised Philistine, that he should <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:6; 17:36; Jer. 9:25, 26">⚓</a>defy the armies of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:10">⚓</a>the living God?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_27"> <sup>27</sup>And the people answered him in this manner, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 5:26; 2 Kin. 19:4; Jer. 10:10">⚓</a>“So shall it be done for the man who kills him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_28"> <sup>28</sup>Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:25">⚓</a>anger was aroused against David, and he said, “Why did you come down here? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the insolence of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_29"> <sup>29</sup>And David said, “What have I done now? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:4, 8–36; (Prov. 18:19; Matt. 10:36)">⚓</a><i>Is</i> there not a cause?” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_30"><sup>30</sup>Then he turned from him toward another and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:17">⚓</a>said the same thing; and these people answered him as the first ones <i>did.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_31"> <sup>31</sup>Now when the words which David spoke were heard, they reported <i>them</i> to Saul; and he sent for him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_32"><sup>32</sup>Then David said to Saul, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:26, 27">⚓</a>“Let no man’s heart fail because of him; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:1–4">⚓</a>your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_33"> <sup>33</sup>And Saul said to David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:18">⚓</a>“You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you <i>are</i> a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_34"> <sup>34</sup>But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep his father’s sheep, and when a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:31; Deut. 9:2">⚓</a>lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_35"><sup>35</sup>I went out after it and struck it, and delivered <i>the</i> <i>lamb</i> from its mouth; and when it arose against me, I caught <i>it</i> by its beard, and struck and killed it. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_36"><sup>36</sup>Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_37"><sup>37</sup>Moreover David said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 14:5">⚓</a>“The Lord, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.”<br/> And Saul said to David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 1:10; 2 Tim. 4:17, 18)">⚓</a>“Go, and the Lord be with you!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_38"> <sup>38</sup>So Saul clothed David with his armor, and he put a bronze helmet on his head; he also clothed him with a coat of mail. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_39"><sup>39</sup>David fastened his sword to his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested <i>them.</i> And David said to Saul, “I cannot walk with these, for I have not tested <i>them.</i>” So David took them off.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_40"> <sup>40</sup>Then he took his staff in his hand; and he chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag, in a pouch which he had, and his sling was in his hand. And he drew near to the Philistine. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_41"><sup>41</sup>So the Philistine came, and began drawing near to David, and the man who bore the shield <i>went</i> before him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_42"><sup>42</sup>And when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:13; 1 Chr. 22:11, 16">⚓</a>disdained him; for he was <i>only</i> a youth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 123:4; Prov. 16:18; 1 Cor. 1:27, 28)">⚓</a>ruddy and good-looking. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_43"><sup>43</sup>So the Philistine <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:12">⚓</a>said to David, “<i>Am</i> I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_44"><sup>44</sup>And the Philistine <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:14; 2 Sam. 3:8; 9:8; 16:9; 2 Kin. 8:13">⚓</a>said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_45"> <sup>45</sup>Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:46; 1 Kin. 20:10, 11">⚓</a>But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 22:33, 35; 2 Chr. 32:8; Ps. 124:8; (2 Cor. 10:4); Heb. 11:33, 34">⚓</a>defied. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_46"><sup>46</sup>This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:10">⚓</a>the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:26">⚓</a>that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_47"><sup>47</sup>Then all this assembly shall know that the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 4:24; 1 Kin. 8:43; 18:36; 2 Kin. 19:19; Is. 52:10">⚓</a>does not save with sword and spear; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:6; 2 Chr. 14:11; 20:15; Ps. 44:6; Hos. 1:7; Zech. 4:6">⚓</a>the battle <i>is</i> the Lord’s, and He will give you into our hands.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_48"> <sup>48</sup>So it was, when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, that David hurried and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 20:15">⚓</a>ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_49"><sup>49</sup>Then David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone; and he slung <i>it</i> and struck the Philistine in his forehead, so that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_50"><sup>50</sup>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 27:3">⚓</a>sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. But <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no sword in the hand of David. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_51"><sup>51</sup>Therefore David ran and stood over the Philistine, took his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:31; 15:15; 20:16">⚓</a>sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it.<br/> And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 21:9; 2 Sam. 23:21">⚓</a>they fled. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_52"><sup>52</sup>Now the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as the entrance of the valley and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell along the road to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 11:34">⚓</a>Shaaraim, even as far as Gath and Ekron. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_53"><sup>53</sup>Then the children of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their tents. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_54"><sup>54</sup>And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_55"> <sup>55</sup>When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:36">⚓</a>Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:50">⚓</a>whose son <i>is</i> this youth?”<br/> And Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_56"> <sup>56</sup>So the king said, “Inquire whose son this young man <i>is.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_57"> <sup>57</sup>Then, as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:21, 22">⚓</a>with the head of the Philistine in his hand. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_17_58"><sup>58</sup>And Saul said to him, “Whose son <i>are</i> you, young man?”<br/> So David answered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:54">⚓</a>“<i>I</i> <i>am</i> the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”<br/></span>
