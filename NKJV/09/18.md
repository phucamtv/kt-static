<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>Saul Resents David</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now when he had finished speaking to Saul, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:12">⚓</a>the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 44:30">⚓</a>and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_2"><sup>2</sup>Saul took him that day, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:6; 1 Sam. 20:17; 2 Sam. 1:26">⚓</a>and would not let him go home to his father’s house anymore. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Jonathan and David made a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:15">⚓</a>covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_4"><sup>4</sup>And Jonathan took off the robe that <i>was</i> on him and gave it to David, with his armor, even to his sword and his bow and his belt.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_5"> <sup>5</sup>So David went out wherever Saul sent him, <i>and</i> behaved wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul’s servants. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_6"><sup>6</sup>Now it had happened as they were coming <i>home,</i> when David was returning from the slaughter of the Philistine, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:8–17">⚓</a>the women had come out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with musical instruments. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_7"><sup>7</sup>So the women <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:20, 21; Judg. 11:34; Ps. 68:25; 149:3">⚓</a>sang as they danced, and said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:21">⚓</a>“Saul has slain his thousands,<br/>   And David his ten thousands.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Saul was very angry, and the saying <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 21:11; 29:5">⚓</a>displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed <i>only</i> thousands. Now <i>what</i> more can he have but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 4:4">⚓</a>the kingdom?” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_9"><sup>9</sup>So Saul eyed David from that day forward.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_10"> <sup>10</sup>And it happened on the next day that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:28">⚓</a>the distressing spirit from God came upon Saul, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:14">⚓</a>and he prophesied inside the house. So David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:24; 1 Kin. 18:29; Acts 16:16">⚓</a>played <i>music</i> with his hand, as at other times; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:23">⚓</a>but <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a spear in Saul’s hand. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_11"><sup>11</sup>And Saul <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:9, 10">⚓</a>cast the spear, for he said, “I will pin David to the wall!” But David escaped his presence twice.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_12"> <sup>12</sup>Now Saul was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:10; 20:33">⚓</a>afraid of David, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:15, 29">⚓</a>the Lord was with him, but had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:13, 18">⚓</a>departed from Saul. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_13"><sup>13</sup>Therefore Saul removed him from his presence, and made him his captain over a thousand; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:14; 28:15">⚓</a>he went out and came in before the people. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_14"><sup>14</sup>And David behaved wisely in all his ways, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:17; 1 Sam. 18:16; 29:6; 2 Sam. 5:2">⚓</a>the Lord<i>was</i> with him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_15"><sup>15</sup>Therefore, when Saul saw that he behaved very wisely, he was afraid of him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_16"><sup>16</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:2, 3, 23; Josh. 6:27; 1 Sam. 16:18">⚓</a>all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David Marries Michal</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:16, 17; 1 Sam. 18:5; 2 Sam. 5:2; 1 Kin. 3:7">⚓</a>I will give her to you as a wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:49; 17:25">⚓</a>the Lord’s battles.” For Saul thought, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:20, 27, 29; 1 Sam. 25:28">⚓</a>“Let my hand not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_18"> <sup>18</sup>So David said to Saul, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:21, 25; 2 Sam. 12:9">⚓</a>“Who <i>am</i> I, and what <i>is</i> my life <i>or</i> my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_19"><sup>19</sup>But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:21; 18:23; 2 Sam. 7:18">⚓</a>Adriel the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 21:8">⚓</a>Meholathite as a wife.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:22; 2 Sam. 21:8; 1 Kin. 19:16">⚓</a>Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David. And they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_21"><sup>21</sup>So Saul said, “I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:28">⚓</a>the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” Therefore Saul said to David a second time, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:17">⚓</a>“You shall be my son-in-law today.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_22"> <sup>22</sup>And Saul commanded his servants, “Communicate with David secretly, and say, ‘Look, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, become the king’s son-in-law.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_23"> <sup>23</sup>So Saul’s servants spoke those words in the hearing of David. And David said, “Does it seem to you <i>a</i> light <i>thing</i> to be a king’s son-in-law, seeing I <i>am</i> a poor and lightly esteemed man?” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_24"><sup>24</sup>And the servants of Saul told him, saying, “In this manner David spoke.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Saul said, “Thus you shall say to David: ‘The king does not desire any <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:26">⚓</a>dowry but one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:12; Ex. 22:17">⚓</a>vengeance on the king’s enemies.’ ” But Saul <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:24">⚓</a>thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_26"><sup>26</sup>So when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to become the king’s son-in-law. Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:17">⚓</a>the days had not expired; </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_27"><sup>27</sup>therefore David arose and went, he and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:21">⚓</a>his men, and killed two hundred men of the Philistines. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:13">⚓</a>David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full count to the king, that he might become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as a wife.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_28"> <sup>28</sup>Thus Saul saw and knew that the Lord<i>was</i> with David, and <i>that</i> Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him; </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_29"><sup>29</sup>and Saul was still more afraid of David. So Saul became David’s enemy continually. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_18_30"><sup>30</sup>Then the princes of the Philistines <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:14">⚓</a>went out <i>to</i> <i>war.</i> And so it was, whenever they went out, <i>that</i> David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 11:1">⚓</a>behaved more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name became highly esteemed.<br/></span>
