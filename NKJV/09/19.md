<div class="title"><h1>19</h1><h3>Saul Persecutes David</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:5">⚓</a>David; but Jonathan, Saul’s son, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:8, 9">⚓</a>delighted greatly in David. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_2"><sup>2</sup>So Jonathan told David, saying, “My father Saul seeks to kill you. Therefore please be on your guard until morning, and stay in a secret <i>place</i> and hide. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_3"><sup>3</sup>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you <i>are,</i> and I will speak with my father about you. Then what I observe, I will tell <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:1">⚓</a>you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_4"> <sup>4</sup>Thus Jonathan <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:8–13">⚓</a>spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, “Let not the king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:32; (Prov. 31:8, 9)">⚓</a>sin against his servant, against David, because he has not sinned against you, and because his works <i>have</i> <i>been</i> very good toward you. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_5"><sup>5</sup>For he took his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 42:22; (Prov. 17:13); Jer. 18:20">⚓</a>life in his hands and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:17; 12:3">⚓</a>killed the Philistine, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:49, 50">⚓</a>the Lord brought about a great deliverance for all Israel. You saw <i>it</i> and rejoiced. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 11:13; 1 Chr. 11:14">⚓</a>Why then will you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:32">⚓</a>sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_6"> <sup>6</sup>So Saul heeded the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, “<i>As</i> the Lord lives, he shall not be killed.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_7"><sup>7</sup>Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all these things. So Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 19:10–13)">⚓</a>as in times past.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_8"> <sup>8</sup>And there was war again; and David went out and fought with the Philistines, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:21; 18:2, 10, 13">⚓</a>and struck them with a mighty blow, and they fled from him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_9"> <sup>9</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:27; 23:5">⚓</a>the distressing spirit from the Lord came upon Saul as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand. And David was playing <i>music</i> with <i>his</i> hand. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_10"><sup>10</sup>Then Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away from Saul’s presence; and he drove the spear into the wall. So David fled and escaped that night.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_11"> <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:14; 18:10, 11">⚓</a>Saul also sent messengers to David’s house to watch him and to kill him in the morning. And Michal, David’s wife, told him, saying, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_12"><sup>12</sup>So Michal <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 16:2; Ps. 59:title">⚓</a>let David down through a window. And he went and fled and escaped. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_13"><sup>13</sup>And Michal took an image and laid <i>it</i> in the bed, put a cover of goats’ <i>hair</i> for his head, and covered <i>it</i> with clothes. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_14"><sup>14</sup>So when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He <i>is</i> sick.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then Saul sent the messengers <i>back</i> to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_16"><sup>16</sup>And when the messengers had come in, there was the image in the bed, with a cover of goats’ <i>hair</i> for his head. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_17"><sup>17</sup>Then Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this, and sent my enemy away, so that he has escaped?”<br/> And Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:15; Acts 9:25; 2 Cor. 11:33">⚓</a>Why should I kill you?’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_18"> <sup>18</sup>So David fled and escaped, and went to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:22">⚓</a>Samuel at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:13">⚓</a>Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_19"><sup>19</sup>Now it was told Saul, saying, “Take note, David <i>is</i> at Naioth in Ramah!” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_20"><sup>20</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:17">⚓</a>Saul sent messengers to take David. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:11, 14; John 7:32">⚓</a>And when they saw the group of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing <i>as</i> leader over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:5, 6, 10; (1 Cor. 14:3, 24, 25)">⚓</a>prophesied. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_21"><sup>21</sup>And when Saul was told, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. Then Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_22"><sup>22</sup>Then he also went to Ramah, and came to the great well that <i>is</i> at Sechu. So he asked, and said, “Where <i>are</i> Samuel and David?”<br/> And <i>someone</i> said, “Indeed <i>they</i> <i>are</i> at Naioth in Ramah.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_23"><sup>23</sup>So he went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:25; Joel 2:28">⚓</a>the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on and prophesied until he came to Naioth in Ramah. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_19_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:10">⚓</a>And he also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 20:2">⚓</a>naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mic. 1:8">⚓</a>“<i>Is</i> Saul also among the prophets?”<br/></span>
