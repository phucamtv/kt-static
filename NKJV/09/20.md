<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>Jonathan’s Loyalty to David</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and went and said to Jonathan, “What have I done? What <i>is</i> my iniquity, and what <i>is</i> my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_2"> <sup>2</sup>So Jonathan said to him, “By no means! You shall not die! Indeed, my father will do nothing either great or small without first telling me. And why should my father hide this thing from me? It <i>is</i> not <i>so!</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then David took an oath again, and said, “Your father certainly knows that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.’ But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:10–12">⚓</a>truly, <i>as</i> the Lord lives and <i>as</i> your soul lives, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> but a step between me and death.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_4"> <sup>4</sup>So Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you yourself desire, I will do <i>it</i> for you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_5"> <sup>5</sup>And David said to Jonathan, “Indeed tomorrow <i>is</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 27:1; 2 Kin. 2:6">⚓</a>New Moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king to eat. But let me go, that I may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 10:10; 28:11–15">⚓</a>hide in the field until the third <i>day</i> at evening. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_6"><sup>6</sup>If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked <i>permission</i> of me that he might run over <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:2, 3">⚓</a>to Bethlehem, his city, for <i>there</i> <i>is</i> a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.’ </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:4; 17:12; John 7:42">⚓</a>If he says thus: ‘<i>It</i> <i>is</i> well,’ your servant will be safe. But if he is very angry, be sure that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:23; 2 Sam. 17:4">⚓</a>evil is determined by him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_8"><sup>8</sup>Therefore you shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:17; Esth. 7:7">⚓</a>deal kindly with your servant, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:14">⚓</a>you have brought your servant into a covenant of the Lord with you. Nevertheless, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:3; 20:16; 23:18">⚓</a>if there is iniquity in me, kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_9"> <sup>9</sup>But Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! For if I knew certainly that evil was determined by my father to come upon you, then would I not tell you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me, or what <i>if</i> your father answers you roughly?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_11"> <sup>11</sup>And Jonathan said to David, “Come, let us go out into the field.” So both of them went out into the field. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_12"><sup>12</sup>Then Jonathan said to David: “The Lord God of Israel <i>is</i> <i>witness!</i> When I have sounded out my father sometime tomorrow, <i>or</i> the third <i>day,</i> and indeed <i>there</i> <i>is</i> good toward David, and I do not send to you and tell you, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_13"><sup>13</sup>may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 14:32">⚓</a>the Lord do so and much more to Jonathan. But if it pleases my father <i>to</i> <i>do</i> you evil, then I will report it to you and send you away, that you may go in safety. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:17; 1 Sam. 3:17">⚓</a>the Lord be with you as He has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:5; 1 Sam. 17:37; 18:12; 1 Chr. 22:11, 16">⚓</a>been with my father. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_14"><sup>14</sup>And you shall not only show me the kindness of the Lord while I still live, that I may not die; </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_15"><sup>15</sup>but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:7">⚓</a>you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever, no, not when the Lord has cut off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_16"><sup>16</sup>So Jonathan made <i>a</i> <i>covenant</i> with the house of David, <i>saying,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:21; 2 Sam. 9:1, 3, 7; 21:7">⚓</a>“Let the Lord require <i>it</i> at the hand of David’s enemies.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now Jonathan again caused David to vow, because he loved him; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 23:21; 1 Sam. 25:22; 31:2; 2 Sam. 4:7; 21:8">⚓</a>for he loved him as he loved his own soul. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_18"><sup>18</sup>Then Jonathan said to David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:1">⚓</a>“Tomorrow <i>is</i> the New Moon; and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_19"><sup>19</sup>And <i>when</i> you have stayed three days, go down quickly and come to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:5, 24">⚓</a>the place where you hid on the day of the deed; and remain by the stone Ezel. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_20"><sup>20</sup>Then I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I shot at a target; </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_21"><sup>21</sup>and there I will send a lad, <i>saying,</i> ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I expressly say to the lad, ‘Look, the arrows <i>are</i> on this side of you; get them and come’—then, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:2">⚓</a>as the Lord lives, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> safety for you and no harm. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_22"><sup>22</sup>But if I say thus to the young man, ‘Look, the arrows <i>are</i> beyond you’—go your way, for the Lord has sent you away. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_23"><sup>23</sup>And as for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 4:2">⚓</a>the matter which you and I have spoken of, indeed the Lord<i>be</i> between you and me forever.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then David hid in the field. And when the New Moon had come, the king sat down to eat the feast. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_25"><sup>25</sup>Now the king sat on his seat, as at other times, on a seat by the wall. And Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_26"><sup>26</sup>Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, “Something has happened to him; he <i>is</i> unclean, surely he <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:14, 15">⚓</a>unclean.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_27"><sup>27</sup>And it happened the next day, the second <i>day</i> of the month, that David’s place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has the son of Jesse not come to eat, either yesterday or today?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_28"> <sup>28</sup>So Jonathan <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 7:20, 21; 15:5">⚓</a>answered Saul, “David earnestly asked <i>permission</i> of me <i>to</i> <i>go</i> to Bethlehem. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_29"><sup>29</sup>And he said, ‘Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>there.</i> And now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me get away and see my brothers.’ Therefore he has not come to the king’s table.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_30"> <sup>30</sup>Then Saul’s anger was aroused against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse, rebellious <i>woman!</i> Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness? </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_31"><sup>31</sup>For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Now therefore, send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_32"> <sup>32</sup>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:6">⚓</a>“Why should he be killed? What has he done?” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_33"><sup>33</sup>Then Saul <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:36; 1 Sam. 19:5; (Prov. 31:9); Matt. 27:23; Luke 23:22">⚓</a>cast a spear at him to kill him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:11; 19:10">⚓</a>by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to kill David.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_34"> <sup>34</sup>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had treated him shamefully.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_35"> <sup>35</sup>And so it was, in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad <i>was</i> with him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_36"><sup>36</sup>Then he said to his lad, “Now run, find the arrows which I shoot.” As the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_37"><sup>37</sup>When the lad had come to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried out after the lad and said, “<i>Is</i> not the arrow beyond you?” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_38"><sup>38</sup>And Jonathan cried out after the lad, “Make haste, hurry, do not delay!” So Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows and came back to his master. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_39"><sup>39</sup>But the lad did not know anything. Only Jonathan and David knew of the matter. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_40"><sup>40</sup>Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, “Go, carry <i>them</i> to the city.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_41"> <sup>41</sup>As soon as the lad had gone, David arose from <i>a</i> <i>place</i> toward the south, fell on his face to the ground, and bowed down three times. And they kissed one another; and they wept together, but David more so. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_20_42"><sup>42</sup>Then Jonathan said to David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:7">⚓</a>“Go in peace, since we have both sworn in the name of the Lord, saying, ‘May the Lord be between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants, forever.’ ” So he arose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.<br/></span>
