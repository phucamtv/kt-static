<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>David and the Holy Bread</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:17">⚓</a>Ahimelech was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:3; Mark 2:26">⚓</a>afraid when he met David, and said to him, “Why <i>are</i> you alone, and no one is with you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_2"> <sup>2</sup>So David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has ordered me on some business, and said to me, ‘Do not let anyone know anything about the business on which I send you, or what I have commanded you.’ And I have directed <i>my</i> young men to such and such a place. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_3"><sup>3</sup>Now therefore, what have you on hand? Give <i>me</i> five <i>loaves</i> <i>of</i> bread in my hand, or whatever can be found.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_4"> <sup>4</sup>And the priest answered David and said, “<i>There</i> <i>is</i> no common bread on hand; but there is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:4">⚓</a>holy bread, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:30; Lev. 24:5–9; Matt. 12:4">⚓</a>if the young men have at least kept themselves from women.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then David answered the priest, and said to him, “Truly, women <i>have</i> <i>been</i> kept from us about three days since I came out. And the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:15">⚓</a>vessels of the young men are holy, and <i>the</i> <i>bread</i> <i>is</i> in effect common, even though it was consecrated <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:14, 15; 1 Thess. 4:4">⚓</a>in the vessel this day.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_6"> <sup>6</sup>So the priest <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 8:26">⚓</a>gave him holy <i>bread;</i> for there was no bread there but the showbread <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:3, 4; Mark 2:25, 26; Luke 6:3, 4">⚓</a>which had been taken from before the Lord, in order to put hot bread <i>in</i> <i>its</i> <i>place</i> on the day when it was taken away.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul <i>was</i> there that day, detained before the Lord. And his name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 24:8, 9">⚓</a>Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of the herdsmen who <i>belonged</i> to Saul.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_8"> <sup>8</sup>And David said to Ahimelech, “Is there not here on hand a spear or a sword? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_9"> <sup>9</sup>So the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:47; 22:9; Ps. 52:title">⚓</a>the Valley of Elah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:2, 50">⚓</a>there it is, wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take <i>it.</i> For <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no other except that one here.”<br/> And David said, “<i>There</i> <i>is</i> none like it; give it to me.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David Flees to Gath</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then David arose and fled that day from before Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_11"><sup>11</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:10">⚓</a>the servants of Achish said to him, “<i>Is</i> this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing of him to one another in dances, saying:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 56:title">⚓</a>‘Saul has slain his thousands,<br/>   And David his ten thousands’?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_12"> <sup>12</sup>Now David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:6–8; 29:5">⚓</a>took these words to heart, and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_13"><sup>13</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:19">⚓</a>he changed his behavior before them, pretended madness in their hands, scratched on the doors of the gate, and let his saliva fall down on his beard. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_14"><sup>14</sup>Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is insane. Why have you brought him to me? </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_21_15"><sup>15</sup>Have I need of madmen, that you have brought this <i>fellow</i> to play the madman in my presence? Shall this <i>fellow</i> come into my house?”<br/></span>
