<div class="title"><h1>22</h1><h3>David’s Four Hundred Men</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_1"> <sup>1</sup>David therefore departed from there and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 34:title">⚓</a>escaped <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 57:title; 142:title">⚓</a>to the cave of Adullam. So when his brothers and all his father’s house heard <i>it,</i> they went down there to him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 12:15; 15:35; 2 Sam. 23:13">⚓</a>And everyone <i>who</i> <i>was</i> in distress, everyone who <i>was</i> in debt, and everyone <i>who</i> <i>was</i> discontented gathered to him. So he became captain over them. And there were about <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:3">⚓</a>four hundred men with him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then David went from there to Mizpah of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:13">⚓</a>Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and mother come here with you, till I know what God will do for me.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_4"><sup>4</sup>So he brought them before the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now the prophet <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:2">⚓</a>Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold; depart, and go to the land of Judah.” So David departed and went into the forest of Hereth.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Saul Murders the Priests</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_6"> <sup>6</sup>When Saul heard that David and the men who <i>were</i> with him had been discovered—now Saul was staying in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:11; 1 Chr. 21:9; 29:29; 2 Chr. 29:25">⚓</a>Gibeah under a tamarisk tree in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants standing about him— </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_7"><sup>7</sup>then Saul said to his servants who stood about him, “Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:34">⚓</a>give every one of you fields and vineyards, <i>and</i> make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds? </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_8"><sup>8</sup>All of you have conspired against me, and <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no one who reveals to me that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:14">⚓</a>my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse; and <i>there</i> <i>is</i> not one of you who is sorry for me or reveals to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as <i>it</i> <i>is</i> this day.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then answered <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:3; 20:16, 30">⚓</a>Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, “I saw the son of Jesse going to Nob, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 21:7; 22:22; Ps. 52:title">⚓</a>Ahimelech the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 21:1">⚓</a>Ahitub. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:3">⚓</a>And he inquired of the Lord for him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:21; 1 Sam. 10:22">⚓</a>gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_11"> <sup>11</sup>So the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests who <i>were</i> in Nob. And they all came to the king. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_12"><sup>12</sup>And Saul said, “Hear now, son of Ahitub!”<br/> He answered, “Here I am, my lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then Saul said to him, “Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as it is this day?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_14"> <sup>14</sup>So Ahimelech answered the king and said, “And who among all your servants <i>is</i> <i>as</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 21:6, 9">⚓</a>faithful as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, who goes at your bidding, and is honorable in your house? </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_15"><sup>15</sup>Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? Far be it from me! Let not the king impute anything to his servant, <i>or</i> to any in the house of my father. For your servant knew nothing of all this, little or much.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_16"> <sup>16</sup>And the king said, “You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:4, 5; 20:32; 24:11">⚓</a>your father’s house!” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_17"><sup>17</sup>Then the king said to the guards who stood about him, “Turn and kill the priests of the Lord, because their hand also <i>is</i> with David, and because they knew when he fled and did not tell it to me.” But the servants of the king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 24:16">⚓</a>would not lift their hands to strike the priests of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_18"><sup>18</sup>And the king said to Doeg, “You turn and kill the priests!” So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck the priests, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:17">⚓</a>killed on that day eighty-five men who wore a linen ephod. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:31">⚓</a>Also Nob, the city of the priests, he struck with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and nursing infants, oxen and donkeys and sheep—with the edge of the sword.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 21:1–45; 1 Sam. 22:9, 11">⚓</a>Now one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 23:6, 9; 30:7; 1 Kin. 2:26, 27">⚓</a>escaped and fled after David. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_21"><sup>21</sup>And Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the Lord’s priests. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_22"><sup>22</sup>So David said to Abiathar, “I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite <i>was</i> there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have caused <i>the</i> <i>death</i> of all the persons of your father’s house. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_22_23"><sup>23</sup>Stay with me; do not fear. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:33">⚓</a>For he who seeks my life seeks your life, but with me you <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> safe.”<br/></span>
