<div class="title"><h1>23</h1><h3>David Saves the City of Keilah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then they told David, saying, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:26">⚓</a>Keilah, and they are robbing the threshing floors.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_2"> <sup>2</sup>Therefore David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:44; Neh. 3:17, 18">⚓</a>inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?”<br/> And the Lord said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines, and save Keilah.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_3"> <sup>3</sup>But David’s men said to him, “Look, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_4"><sup>4</sup>Then David inquired of the Lord once again.<br/> And the Lord answered him and said, “Arise, go down to Keilah. For I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_5"><sup>5</sup>And David and his men went to Keilah and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 22:10; 23:4, 6, 9; 28:6; 30:8; 2 Sam. 5:19, 23">⚓</a>fought with the Philistines, struck them with a mighty blow, and took away their livestock. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now it happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:8; 2 Sam. 5:20">⚓</a>fled to David at Keilah, <i>that</i> he went down <i>with</i> an ephod in his hand.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_7"> <sup>7</sup>And Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah. So Saul said, “God has delivered him into my hand, for he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_8"><sup>8</sup>Then Saul called all the people together for war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_9"> <sup>9</sup>When David knew that Saul plotted evil against him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 22:20">⚓</a>he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_10"><sup>10</sup>Then David said, “O Lord God of Israel, Your servant has certainly heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:21; 1 Sam. 23:6; 30:7">⚓</a>to destroy the city for my sake. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_11"><sup>11</sup>Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O Lord God of Israel, I pray, tell Your servant.”<br/> And the Lord said, “He will come down.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?”<br/> And the Lord said, “They will deliver <i>you.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_13"> <sup>13</sup>So David and his men, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 22:19">⚓</a>about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah and went wherever they could go. Then it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah; so he halted the expedition.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David in Wilderness Strongholds</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_14"> <sup>14</sup>And David stayed in strongholds in the wilderness, and remained in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 22:2; 25:13">⚓</a>the mountains in the Wilderness of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 11:1">⚓</a>Ziph. Saul <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:55; 2 Chr. 11:8">⚓</a>sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_15"><sup>15</sup>So David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. And David <i>was</i> in the Wilderness of Ziph in a forest. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_16"><sup>16</sup>Then Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose and went to David in the woods and strengthened his hand in God. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_17"><sup>17</sup>And he said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 32:7; 54:3, 4">⚓</a>“Do not fear, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 27:1–3; Heb. 13:6)">⚓</a>Even my father Saul knows that.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_18"><sup>18</sup>So the two of them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:31; 24:20">⚓</a>made a covenant before the Lord. And David stayed in the woods, and Jonathan went to his own house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then the Ziphites <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:3; 20:12–17, 42; 2 Sam. 9:1; 21:7">⚓</a>came up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is David not hiding with us in strongholds in the woods, in the hill of Hachilah, which <i>is</i> on the south of Jeshimon? </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_20"><sup>20</sup>Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of your soul to come down; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:1; Ps. 54:title">⚓</a>our part <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> to deliver him into the king’s hand.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_21"> <sup>21</sup>And Saul said, “Blessed <i>are</i> you of the Lord, for you have compassion on me. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_22"><sup>22</sup>Please go and find out for sure, and see the place where his hideout is, <i>and</i> who has seen him there. For I am told he is very crafty. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_23"><sup>23</sup>See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hides; and come back to me with certainty, and I will go with you. And it shall be, if he is in the land, that I will search for him throughout all the clans of Judah.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_24"> <sup>24</sup>So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men <i>were</i> in the Wilderness <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 54:3">⚓</a>of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_25"><sup>25</sup>When Saul and his men went to seek <i>him,</i> they told David. Therefore he went down to the rock, and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard <i>that,</i> he pursued David in the Wilderness of Maon. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_26"><sup>26</sup>Then Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:55; 1 Sam. 25:2">⚓</a>So David made haste to get away from Saul, for Saul and his men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 31:22">⚓</a>were encircling David and his men to take them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_27"> <sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 17:9">⚓</a>But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land!” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_28"><sup>28</sup>Therefore Saul returned from pursuing David, and went against the Philistines; so they called that place the Rock of Escape. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_23_29"><sup>29</sup>Then David went up from there and dwelt in strongholds at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:9">⚓</a>En Gedi.<br/></span>
