<div class="title"><h1>24</h1><h3>David Spares Saul</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it happened, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:62; 2 Chr. 20:2">⚓</a>when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, “Take note! David <i>is</i> in the Wilderness of En Gedi.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_2"><sup>2</sup>Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 23:19, 28, 29">⚓</a>went to seek David and his men on the Rocks of the Wild Goats. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_3"><sup>3</sup>So he came to the sheepfolds by the road, where there <i>was</i> a cave; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:2; Ps. 38:12">⚓</a>Saul went in to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:10">⚓</a>attend to his needs. (<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:24">⚓</a>David and his men were staying in the recesses of the cave.) </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 57:title; 142:title">⚓</a>Then the men of David said to him, “This is the day of which the Lord said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do to him as it seems good to you.’ ” And David arose and secretly cut off a corner of Saul’s robe. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_5"><sup>5</sup>Now it happened afterward that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:8–11">⚓</a>David’s heart troubled him because he had cut Saul’s robe. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_6"><sup>6</sup>And he said to his men, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:10">⚓</a>“The Lord forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the Lord’s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, seeing he <i>is</i> the anointed of the Lord.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_7"><sup>7</sup>So David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:11">⚓</a>restrained his servants with <i>these</i> words, and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul got up from the cave and went on <i>his</i> way.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_8"> <sup>8</sup>David also arose afterward, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed down. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_9"><sup>9</sup>And David said to Saul: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 7:4; (Matt. 5:44; Rom. 12:17, 19)">⚓</a>“Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Indeed David seeks your harm’? </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_10"><sup>10</sup>Look, this day your eyes have seen that the Lord delivered you today into my hand in the cave, and <i>someone</i> urged <i>me</i> to kill you. But <i>my</i> <i>eye</i> spared you, and I said, ‘I will not stretch out my hand against my lord, for he <i>is</i> the Lord’s anointed.’ </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_11"><sup>11</sup>Moreover, my father, see! Yes, see the corner of your robe in my hand! For in that I cut off the corner of your robe, and did not kill you, know and see that <i>there</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 141:6; (Prov. 16:28; 17:9)">⚓</a>neither evil nor rebellion in my hand, and I have not sinned against you. Yet you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:27; Ps. 7:3; 35:7">⚓</a>hunt my life to take it. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:20">⚓</a>Let the Lord judge between you and me, and let the Lord avenge me on you. But my hand shall not be against you. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_13"><sup>13</sup>As the proverb of the ancients says, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:5; Judg. 11:27; 1 Sam. 26:10–23; Job 5:8">⚓</a>‘Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.’ But my hand shall not be against you. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_14"><sup>14</sup>After whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 7:16–20)">⚓</a>A dead dog? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:43; 2 Sam. 9:8">⚓</a>A flea? </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:20">⚓</a>Therefore let the Lord be judge, and judge between you and me, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:12">⚓</a>see and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 24:22">⚓</a>plead my case, and deliver me out of your hand.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_16"> <sup>16</sup>So it was, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 35:1; 43:1; 119:154; Mic. 7:9">⚓</a>“<i>Is</i> this your voice, my son David?” And Saul lifted up his voice and wept. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:17">⚓</a>Then he said to David: “You <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:21">⚓</a>more righteous than I; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 38:26">⚓</a>you have rewarded me with good, whereas I have rewarded you with evil. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_18"><sup>18</sup>And you have shown this day how you have dealt well with me; for when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 5:44)">⚓</a>the Lord delivered me into your hand, you did not kill me. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_19"><sup>19</sup>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him get away safely? Therefore may the Lord reward you with good for what you have done to me this day. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_20"><sup>20</sup>And now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:23">⚓</a>I know indeed that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 23:17">⚓</a>Therefore swear now to me by the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:23; 1 Sam. 20:14–17">⚓</a>that you will not cut off my descendants after me, and that you will not destroy my name from my father’s house.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_24_22"> <sup>22</sup>So David swore to Saul. And Saul went home, but David and his men went up to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 21:6–8">⚓</a>the stronghold.<br/></span>
