<div class="title"><h1>25</h1><h3>Death of Samuel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 23:29">⚓</a>Samuel died; and the Israelites gathered together and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 28:3">⚓</a>lamented for him, and buried him at his home in Ramah. And David arose and went down <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:29; Deut. 34:8">⚓</a>to the Wilderness of Paran.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David and the Wife of Nabal</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_2"> <sup>2</sup>Now <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:21; Num. 10:12; 13:3">⚓</a>in Maon whose business <i>was</i> in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 23:24">⚓</a>Carmel, and the man <i>was</i> very rich. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. And he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_3"><sup>3</sup>The name of the man <i>was</i> Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigail. And <i>she</i> <i>was</i> a woman of good understanding and beautiful appearance; but the man <i>was</i> harsh and evil in <i>his</i> doings. He <i>was</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>house</i> <i>of</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:55">⚓</a>Caleb.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_4"> <sup>4</sup>When David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:13; 1 Sam. 30:14">⚓</a>shearing his sheep, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_5"><sup>5</sup>David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel, go to Nabal, and greet him in my name. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_6"><sup>6</sup>And thus you shall say to him who lives <i>in</i> <i>prosperity:</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 38:13; 2 Sam. 13:23">⚓</a>‘Peace <i>be</i> to you, peace to your house, and peace to all that you have! </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_7"><sup>7</sup>Now I have heard that you have shearers. Your shepherds were with us, and we did not hurt them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:20; 1 Chr. 12:18; Ps. 122:7; Luke 10:5">⚓</a>nor was there anything missing from them all the while they were in Carmel. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_8"><sup>8</sup>Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let <i>my</i> young men find favor in your eyes, for we come on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:15, 21">⚓</a>a feast day. Please give whatever comes to your hand to your servants and to your son David.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_9"> <sup>9</sup>So when David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in the name of David, and waited.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 8:10–12; Esth. 8:17; 9:19, 22">⚓</a>“Who <i>is</i> David, and who <i>is</i> the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays who break away each one from his master. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:28">⚓</a>Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give <i>it</i> to men when I do not know where they <i>are</i> from?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_12"> <sup>12</sup>So David’s young men turned on their heels and went back; and they came and told him all these words. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_13"><sup>13</sup>Then David said to his men, “Every man gird on his sword.” So every man girded on his sword, and David also girded on his sword. And about four hundred men went with David, and two hundred <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:6, 15">⚓</a>stayed with the supplies.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_14"> <sup>14</sup>Now one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, “Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master; and he reviled them. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_15"><sup>15</sup>But the men <i>were</i> very good to us, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 30:24">⚓</a>we were not hurt, nor did we miss anything as long as we accompanied them, when we were in the fields. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_16"><sup>16</sup>They were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:7, 21">⚓</a>a wall to us both by night and day, all the time we were with them keeping the sheep. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_17"><sup>17</sup>Now therefore, know and consider what you will do, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:22; Job 1:10">⚓</a>harm is determined against our master and against all his household. For he <i>is</i> <i>such</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:7">⚓</a>scoundrel that <i>one</i> cannot speak to him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then Abigail made haste and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:13; Judg. 19:22">⚓</a>took two hundred <i>loaves</i> of bread, two skins of wine, five sheep already dressed, five seahs of roasted <i>grain,</i> one hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded <i>them</i> on donkeys. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_19"><sup>19</sup>And she said to her servants, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:13; (Prov. 18:16; 21:14)">⚓</a>“Go on before me; see, I am coming after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_20"> <sup>20</sup>So it was, <i>as</i> she rode on the donkey, that she went down under cover of the hill; and there were David and his men, coming down toward her, and she met them. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_21"><sup>21</sup>Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have protected all that this <i>fellow</i> has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that <i>belongs</i> to him. And he has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:16, 20">⚓</a>repaid me evil for good. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:17; Ps. 109:5; (Prov. 17:13)">⚓</a>May God do so, and more also, to the enemies of David, if I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:17; 1 Sam. 3:17; 20:13, 16">⚓</a>leave <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:34">⚓</a>one male of all who <i>belong</i> to him by morning light.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_23"> <sup>23</sup>Now when Abigail saw David, she <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:10; 21:21; 2 Kin. 9:8">⚓</a>dismounted quickly from the donkey, fell on her face before David, and bowed down to the ground. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_24"><sup>24</sup>So she fell at his feet and said: “On me, my lord, <i>on</i> me <i>let</i> this iniquity <i>be!</i> And please let your maidservant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your maidservant. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_25"><sup>25</sup>Please, let not my lord regard this scoundrel Nabal. For as his name <i>is,</i> so <i>is</i> he: Nabal <i>is</i> his name, and folly <i>is</i> with him! But I, your maidservant, did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_26"><sup>26</sup>Now therefore, my lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:18; Judg. 1:14">⚓</a><i>as</i> the Lord lives and <i>as</i> your soul lives, since the Lord has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:2">⚓</a>held you back from coming to bloodshed and from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:6; 1 Sam. 25:33">⚓</a>avenging yourself with your own hand, now then, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 12:19)">⚓</a>let your enemies and those who seek harm for my lord be as Nabal. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_27"><sup>27</sup>And now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 18:32">⚓</a>this present which your maidservant has brought to my lord, let it be given to the young men who follow my lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_28"><sup>28</sup>Please forgive the trespass of your maidservant. For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:11; 1 Sam. 30:26; 2 Kin. 5:15">⚓</a>the Lord will certainly make for my lord an enduring house, because my lord <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:11–16, 27; 1 Kin. 9:5; 1 Chr. 17:10, 25">⚓</a>fights the battles of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:17">⚓</a>and evil is not found in you throughout your days. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_29"><sup>29</sup>Yet a man has risen to pursue you and seek your life, but the life of my lord shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:11; Ps. 7:3">⚓</a>bound in the bundle of the living with the Lord your God; and the lives of your enemies He shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 66:9; Col. 3:3)">⚓</a>sling out, <i>as</i> <i>from</i> the pocket of a sling. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_30"><sup>30</sup>And it shall come to pass, when the Lord has done for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 10:18">⚓</a>ruler over Israel, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_31"><sup>31</sup>that this will be no grief to you, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause, or that my lord has avenged himself. But when the Lord has dealt well with my lord, then remember your maidservant.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_32"> <sup>32</sup>Then David said to Abigail: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:14; 15:28">⚓</a>“Blessed <i>is</i> the Lord God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me! </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_33"><sup>33</sup>And blessed <i>is</i> your advice and blessed <i>are</i> you, because you have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:27; Ex. 18:10; 1 Kin. 1:48; Ps. 41:13; 72:18; 106:48; Luke 1:68">⚓</a>kept me this day from coming to bloodshed and from avenging myself with my own hand. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_34"><sup>34</sup>For indeed, <i>as</i> the Lord God of Israel lives, who has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:26">⚓</a>kept me back from hurting you, unless you had hurried and come to meet me, surely <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:26">⚓</a>by morning light no males would have been left to Nabal!” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_35"><sup>35</sup>So David received from her hand what she had brought him, and said to her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:22">⚓</a>“Go up in peace to your house. See, I have heeded your voice and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:42; 2 Sam. 15:9; 2 Kin. 5:19; Luke 7:50; 8:48">⚓</a>respected your person.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_36"> <sup>36</sup>Now Abigail went to Nabal, and there he was, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:21">⚓</a>holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal’s heart <i>was</i> merry within him, for he <i>was</i> very drunk; therefore she told him nothing, little or much, until morning light. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_37"><sup>37</sup>So it was, in the morning, when the wine had gone from Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became <i>like</i> a stone. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_38"><sup>38</sup>Then it happened, <i>after</i> about ten days, that the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 13:28; Prov. 20:1; Is. 5:11; Dan. 5:1; (Hos. 4:11)">⚓</a>struck Nabal, and he died.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_39"> <sup>39</sup>So when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:10; 2 Sam. 6:7; Ps. 104:29">⚓</a>“Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord, who has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:32">⚓</a>pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:15; Prov. 22:23">⚓</a>kept His servant from evil! For the Lord has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:26, 34">⚓</a>returned the wickedness of Nabal on his own head.”<br/> And David sent and proposed to Abigail, to take her as his wife. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_40"><sup>40</sup>When the servants of David had come to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her saying, “David sent us to you, to ask you to become his wife.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_41"> <sup>41</sup>Then she arose, bowed her face to the earth, and said, “Here is your maidservant, a servant to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:44">⚓</a>wash the feet of the servants of my lord.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_42"><sup>42</sup>So Abigail rose in haste and rode on a donkey, attended by five of her maidens; and she followed the messengers of David, and became his wife. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_43"><sup>43</sup>David also took Ahinoam <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 15:33); Luke 7:38, 44">⚓</a>of Jezreel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:56">⚓</a>and so both of them were his wives.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_25_44"> <sup>44</sup>But Saul had given <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 27:3; 30:5">⚓</a>Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who <i>was</i> from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:20; 2 Sam. 3:14">⚓</a>Gallim.<br/></span>
