<div class="title"><h1>26</h1><h3>David Spares Saul a Second Time</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 10:30">⚓</a>“Is David not hiding in the hill of Hachilah, opposite Jeshimon?” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_2"><sup>2</sup>Then Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, having <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 23:19; Ps. 54:title">⚓</a>three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the Wilderness of Ziph. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_3"><sup>3</sup>And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which <i>is</i> opposite Jeshimon, by the road. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_4"><sup>4</sup>David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had indeed come.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_5"> <sup>5</sup>So David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:2; 24:2">⚓</a>Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army. Now Saul lay within the camp, with the people encamped all around him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_6"><sup>6</sup>Then David answered, and said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:50, 51; 17:55">⚓</a>the son of Zeruiah, brother of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 2:16">⚓</a>Joab, saying, “Who will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:13">⚓</a>go down with me to Saul in the camp?”<br/> And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:10, 11">⚓</a>Abishai said, “I will go down with you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_7"> <sup>7</sup>So David and Abishai came to the people by night; and there Saul lay sleeping within the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the people lay all around him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_8"><sup>8</sup>Then Abishai said to David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:18, 24">⚓</a>“God has delivered your enemy into your hand this day. Now therefore, please, let me strike him at once with the spear, right to the earth; and I will not <i>have</i> <i>to</i> <i>strike</i> him a second time!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_9"> <sup>9</sup>But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:4">⚓</a>for who can stretch out his hand against the Lord’s anointed, and be guiltless?” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_10"><sup>10</sup>David said furthermore, “<i>As</i> the Lord lives, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:6, 7; 2 Sam. 1:14, 16">⚓</a>the Lord shall strike him, or <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 32:35); 1 Sam. 25:26, 38; (Luke 18:7; Rom. 12:19; Heb. 10:30)">⚓</a>his day shall come to die, or he shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:29; Deut. 31:14; (Job 7:1; 14:5); Ps. 37:13">⚓</a>go out to battle and perish. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:6">⚓</a>The Lord forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the Lord’s anointed. But please, take now the spear and the jug of water that <i>are</i> by his head, and let us go.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_12"><sup>12</sup>So David took the spear and the jug of water <i>by</i> Saul’s head, and they got away; and no man saw or knew <i>it</i> or awoke. For they <i>were</i> all asleep, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:6–12; (Rom. 12:17, 19)">⚓</a>a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen on them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off, a great distance <i>being</i> between them. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_14"><sup>14</sup>And David called out to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, “Do you not answer, Abner?”<br/> Then Abner answered and said, “Who <i>are</i> you, calling out to the king?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_15"> <sup>15</sup>So David said to Abner, “<i>Are</i> you not a man? And who <i>is</i> like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy your lord the king. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_16"><sup>16</sup>This thing that you have done <i>is</i> not good. <i>As</i> the Lord lives, you deserve to die, because you have not guarded your master, the Lord’s anointed. And now see where the king’s spear <i>is,</i> and the jug of water that <i>was</i> by his head.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Saul knew David’s voice, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:21; 15:12; Is. 29:10">⚓</a>“<i>Is</i> that your voice, my son David?”<br/> David said, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> my voice, my lord, O king.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_18"><sup>18</sup>And he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:16">⚓</a>“Why does my lord thus pursue his servant? For what have I done, or what evil <i>is</i> in my hand? </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_19"><sup>19</sup>Now therefore, please, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant: If the Lord has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:9, 11–14">⚓</a>stirred you up against me, let Him accept an offering. But if <i>it</i> <i>is</i> the children of men, <i>may</i> they <i>be</i> cursed before the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:11; 24:1">⚓</a>for they have driven me out this day from sharing in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:27, 28">⚓</a>inheritance of the Lord, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods.’ </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_20"><sup>20</sup>So now, do not let my blood fall to the earth before the face of the Lord. For the king of Israel has come out to seek <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 14:16; 20:19">⚓</a>a flea, as when one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Saul said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:14">⚓</a>“I have sinned. Return, my son David. For I will harm you no more, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Indeed I have played the fool and erred exceedingly.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_22"> <sup>22</sup>And David answered and said, “Here is the king’s spear. Let one of the young men come over and get it. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:27; 1 Sam. 15:24, 30; 24:17; 2 Sam. 12:13">⚓</a>May the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:19; Ps. 7:8; 18:20; 62:12">⚓</a>repay every man <i>for</i> his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the Lord delivered you into <i>my</i> hand today, but I would not stretch out my hand against the Lord’s anointed. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_24"><sup>24</sup>And indeed, as your life was valued much this day in my eyes, so let my life be valued much in the eyes of the Lord, and let Him deliver me out of all tribulation.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_26_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Saul said to David, “<i>May</i> you <i>be</i> blessed, my son David! You shall both do great things and also still <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 22:21">⚓</a>prevail.”<br/> So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.<br/></span>
