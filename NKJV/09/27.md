<div class="title"><h1>27</h1><h3>David Allied with the Philistines</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_27_1"> <sup>1</sup>And David said in his heart, “Now I shall perish someday by the hand of Saul. <i>There</i> <i>is</i> nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape to the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me anymore in any part of Israel. So I shall escape out of his hand.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_27_2"><sup>2</sup>Then David arose <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:28; 1 Sam. 24:20">⚓</a>and went over with the six hundred men who <i>were</i> with him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:13">⚓</a>to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_27_3"><sup>3</sup>So David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each man with his household, <i>and</i> David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 21:10; 1 Kin. 2:39">⚓</a>with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s widow. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_27_4"><sup>4</sup>And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath; so he sought him no more.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_27_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then David said to Achish, “If I have now found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there. For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_27_6"><sup>6</sup>So Achish gave him Ziklag that day. Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:42, 43">⚓</a>Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_27_7"><sup>7</sup>Now the time that David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:31; 19:5; 1 Chr. 12:1; Neh. 11:28">⚓</a>dwelt in the country of the Philistines was one full year and four months.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_27_8"> <sup>8</sup>And David and his men went up and raided <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 29:3">⚓</a>the Geshurites, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 13:2, 13">⚓</a>the Girzites, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:10; Judg. 1:29">⚓</a>Amalekites. For those <i>nations</i> were the inhabitants of the land from of old, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 17:8, 16; 1 Sam. 15:7, 8">⚓</a>as you go to Shur, even as far as the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_27_9"><sup>9</sup>Whenever David attacked the land, he left neither man nor woman alive, but took away the sheep, the oxen, the donkeys, the camels, and the apparel, and returned and came to Achish. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_27_10"><sup>10</sup>Then Achish would say, “Where have you made a raid today?” And David would say, “Against the southern <i>area</i> of Judah, or against the southern <i>area</i> of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:18; Ex. 15:22">⚓</a>the Jerahmeelites, or against the southern <i>area</i> of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 2:9, 25">⚓</a>the Kenites.” </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_27_11"><sup>11</sup>David would save neither man nor woman alive, to bring <i>news</i> to Gath, saying, “Lest they should inform on us, saying, ‘Thus David did.’ ” And thus <i>was</i> his behavior all the time he dwelt in the country of the Philistines. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_27_12"><sup>12</sup>So Achish believed David, saying, “He has made his people Israel utterly abhor him; therefore he will be my servant forever.”<br/></span>
