<span class="verse 1sa_28_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:16">⚓</a>it happened in those days that the Philistines gathered their armies together for war, to fight with Israel. And Achish said to David, “You assuredly know that you will go out with me to battle, you and your men.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_2"> <sup>2</sup>So David said to Achish, “Surely you know what your servant can do.”<br/> And Achish said to David, “Therefore I will make you one of my chief guardians forever.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Saul Consults a Medium</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_3"> <sup>3</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 29:1, 2">⚓</a>Samuel had died, and all Israel had lamented for him and buried him in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:1">⚓</a>Ramah, in his own city. And Saul had put <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:19">⚓</a>the mediums and the spiritists out of the land.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then the Philistines gathered together, and came and encamped at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:18; Lev. 19:31; 20:27; Deut. 18:10, 11; 1 Sam. 15:23; 28:9">⚓</a>Shunem. So Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:18; 1 Sam. 28:4; 1 Kin. 1:3; 2 Kin. 4:8">⚓</a>Gilboa. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_5"><sup>5</sup>When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:1">⚓</a>afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_6"><sup>6</sup>And when Saul inquired of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 18:11; (Is. 57:20)">⚓</a>the Lord did not answer him, either by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:37; Prov. 1:28; Lam. 2:9">⚓</a>dreams or <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:6; Joel 2:28">⚓</a>by Urim or by the prophets.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then Saul said to his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 28:30; Num. 27:21; Deut. 33:8">⚓</a>that I may go to her and inquire of her.”<br/> And his servants said to him, “In fact, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> a woman who is a medium at En Dor.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_8"> <sup>8</sup>So Saul disguised himself and put on other clothes, and he went, and two men with him; and they came to the woman by night. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 10:13">⚓</a>he said, “Please conduct a séance for me, and bring up for me the one I shall name to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then the woman said to him, “Look, you know what Saul has done, how he has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 18:10, 11; 1 Chr. 10:13; Is. 8:19">⚓</a>cut off the mediums and the spiritists from the land. Why then do you lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_10"> <sup>10</sup>And Saul swore to her by the Lord, saying, “<i>As</i> the Lord lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?”<br/> And he said, “Bring up Samuel for me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_12"> <sup>12</sup>When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Saul, saying, “Why have you deceived me? For you <i>are</i> Saul!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_13"> <sup>13</sup>And the king said to her, “Do not be afraid. What did you see?”<br/> And the woman said to Saul, “I saw <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 28:3">⚓</a>a spirit ascending out of the earth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_14"> <sup>14</sup>So he said to her, “What <i>is</i> his form?”<br/> And she said, “An old man is coming up, and he <i>is</i> covered with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:28; Ps. 138:1">⚓</a>a mantle.” And Saul perceived that it <i>was</i> Samuel, and he stooped with <i>his</i> face to the ground and bowed down.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_15"> <sup>15</sup>Now Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:27; 2 Kin. 2:8, 13">⚓</a>disturbed me by bringing me up?”<br/> And Saul answered, “I am deeply distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 14:9">⚓</a>God has departed from me and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:14; 18:12">⚓</a>does not answer me anymore, neither by prophets nor by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may reveal to me what I should do.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then Samuel said: “So why do you ask me, seeing the Lord has departed from you and has become your enemy? </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_17"><sup>17</sup>And the Lord has done for Himself <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 28:6">⚓</a>as He spoke by me. For the Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:28">⚓</a>Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord nor execute His fierce wrath upon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:9–13; 15:1–26; 1 Kin. 20:42; 1 Chr. 10:13; Jer. 48:10">⚓</a>Amalek, therefore the Lord has done this thing to you this day. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_19"><sup>19</sup>Moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines. And tomorrow you and your sons <i>will</i> <i>be</i> with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:3–9">⚓</a>me. The Lord will also deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_20"> <sup>20</sup>Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, and was dreadfully afraid because of the words of Samuel. And there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no food all day or all night.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_21"> <sup>21</sup>And the woman came to Saul and saw that he was severely troubled, and said to him, “Look, your maidservant has obeyed your voice, and I have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:1–6; Job 3:17–19">⚓</a>put my life in my hands and heeded the words which you spoke to me. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_22"><sup>22</sup>Now therefore, please, heed also the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a piece of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on <i>your</i> way.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_23"> <sup>23</sup>But he refused and said, “I will not eat.”<br/> So his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he heeded their voice. Then he arose from the ground and sat on the bed. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_24"><sup>24</sup>Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she hastened to kill it. And she took flour and kneaded <i>it,</i> and baked unleavened bread from it. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_28_25"><sup>25</sup>So she brought <i>it</i> before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.<br/></span>
