<div class="title"><h1>29</h1><h3>The Philistines Reject David</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1sa_29_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 12:3; 1 Sam. 19:5; Job 13:14">⚓</a>the Philistines gathered together all their armies <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 28:1">⚓</a>at Aphek, and the Israelites encamped by a fountain which <i>is</i> in Jezreel. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_29_2"><sup>2</sup>And the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 12:18; 19:30; 1 Sam. 4:1; 1 Kin. 20:30">⚓</a>lords of the Philistines passed in review by hundreds and by thousands, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 6:4; 7:7">⚓</a>David and his men passed in review at the rear with Achish. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_29_3"><sup>3</sup>Then the princes of the Philistines said, “What <i>are</i> these Hebrews <i>doing</i> <i>here?</i>”<br/> And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, “<i>Is</i> this not David, the servant of Saul king of Israel, who has been with me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 28:1, 2">⚓</a>these days, or these years? And to this day I have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 27:7">⚓</a>found no fault in him since he defected <i>to</i> <i>me.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_29_4"> <sup>4</sup>But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; so the princes of the Philistines said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 27:1–6; 1 Chr. 12:19, 20; Dan. 6:5">⚓</a>“Make this fellow return, that he may go back to the place which you have appointed for him, and do not let him go down with us to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 27:6">⚓</a>battle, lest <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:21">⚓</a>in the battle he become our adversary. For with what could he reconcile himself to his master, if not with the heads of these <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 29:9">⚓</a>men? </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_29_5"><sup>5</sup><i>Is</i> this not David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 12:19, 20">⚓</a>of whom they sang to one another in dances, saying:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 21:11">⚓</a>‘Saul has slain his thousands,<br/>   And David his ten thousands’?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_29_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then Achish called David and said to him, “Surely, <i>as</i> the Lord lives, you have been upright, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:7">⚓</a>your going out and your coming in with me in the army <i>is</i> good in my sight. For to this day <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:25; 2 Kin. 19:27">⚓</a>I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me. Nevertheless the lords do not favor you. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_29_7"><sup>7</sup>Therefore return now, and go in peace, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_29_8"> <sup>8</sup>So David said to Achish, “But what have I done? And to this day what have you found in your servant as long as I have been with you, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_29_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then Achish answered and said to David, “I know that you <i>are</i> as good in my sight <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 29:3">⚓</a>as an angel of God; nevertheless <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 14:17, 20; 19:27">⚓</a>the princes of the Philistines have said, ‘He shall not go up with us to the battle.’ </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_29_10"><sup>10</sup>Now therefore, rise early in the morning with your master’s servants <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 29:4">⚓</a>who have come with you. And as soon as you are up early in the morning and have light, depart.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_29_11"> <sup>11</sup>So David and his men rose early to depart in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 12:19, 22">⚓</a>And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.<br/></span>
