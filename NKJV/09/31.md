<span class="verse 1sa_31_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 23:22">⚓</a>the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 10:1–12">⚓</a>Gilboa. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_31_2"><sup>2</sup>Then the Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons. And the Philistines killed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 28:4">⚓</a>Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul’s sons. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_31_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:49; 1 Chr. 8:33">⚓</a>The battle became fierce against Saul. The archers hit him, and he was severely wounded by the archers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_31_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:6">⚓</a>Then Saul said to his armorbearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:54; 1 Chr. 10:4">⚓</a>these uncircumcised men come and thrust me through and abuse me.”<br/> But his armorbearer would not, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 14:3; 1 Sam. 14:6; 17:26, 36">⚓</a>for he was greatly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:14">⚓</a>fell on it. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_31_5"><sup>5</sup>And when his armorbearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword, and died with him. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_31_6"><sup>6</sup>So Saul, his three sons, his armorbearer, and all his men died together that same day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_31_7"> <sup>7</sup>And when the men of Israel who <i>were</i> on the other side of the valley, and <i>those</i> who <i>were</i> on the other side of the Jordan, saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_31_8"><sup>8</sup>So it happened the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_31_9"><sup>9</sup>And they cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and sent <i>word</i> throughout the land of the Philistines, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:6, 10">⚓</a>proclaim <i>it</i> <i>in</i> the temple of their idols and among the people. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_31_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 16:23, 24; 2 Sam. 1:20">⚓</a>Then they put his armor in the temple of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 21:9">⚓</a>Ashtoreths, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:13; 1 Sam. 7:3">⚓</a>they fastened his body to the wall of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 21:12">⚓</a>Beth Shan.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1sa_31_11"> <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:27">⚓</a>Now when the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_31_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 11:1–13">⚓</a>all the valiant men arose and traveled all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan; and they came to Jabesh and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 11:1–11; 2 Sam. 2:4–7">⚓</a>burned them there. </span>
<span class="verse 1sa_31_13"><sup>13</sup>Then they took their bones and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 16:14; Jer. 34:5; Amos 6:10">⚓</a>buried <i>them</i> under the tamarisk tree at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:4, 5; 21:12–14">⚓</a>Jabesh, and fasted seven days.<br/></span>
