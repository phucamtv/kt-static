<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>The Report of Saul’s Death</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass after the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:10">⚓</a>death of Saul, when David had returned from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:6">⚓</a>the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_2"><sup>2</sup>on the third day, behold, it happened that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 30:1, 17, 26">⚓</a>a man came from Saul’s camp <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 4:10">⚓</a>with his clothes torn and dust on his head. So it was, when he came to David, that he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 4:12">⚓</a>fell to the ground and prostrated himself.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_3"> <sup>3</sup>And David said to him, “Where have you come from?”<br/> So he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then David said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:23">⚓</a>“How did the matter go? Please tell me.”<br/> And he answered, “The people have fled from the battle, many of the people are fallen and dead, and Saul and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 4:16; 31:3">⚓</a>Jonathan his son are dead also.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_5"> <sup>5</sup>So David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then the young man who told him said, “As I happened by chance <i>to</i> <i>be</i> on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:2">⚓</a>Mount Gilboa, there was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:1">⚓</a>Saul, leaning on his spear; and indeed the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_7"><sup>7</sup>Now when he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’ </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_8"><sup>8</sup>And he said to me, ‘Who <i>are</i> you?’ So I answered him, ‘I <i>am</i> an Amalekite.’ </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_9"><sup>9</sup>He said to me again, ‘Please stand over me and kill me, for anguish has come upon me, but my life still <i>remains</i> in me.’ </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_10"><sup>10</sup>So I stood over him and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:2–4">⚓</a>killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that <i>was</i> on his head and the bracelet that <i>was</i> on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_11"> <sup>11</sup>Therefore David took hold of his own clothes and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:54; 2 Kin. 11:12">⚓</a>tore them, and <i>so</i> <i>did</i> all the men who <i>were</i> with him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_12"><sup>12</sup>And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:31; 13:31">⚓</a>mourned and wept and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:31">⚓</a>fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son, for the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:13">⚓</a>people of the Lord and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then David said to the young man who told him, “Where <i>are</i> you from?”<br/> And he answered, “I <i>am</i> the son of an alien, an Amalekite.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_14"> <sup>14</sup>So David said to him, “How <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:21">⚓</a>was it you were not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:8">⚓</a>afraid to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:4">⚓</a>put forth your hand to destroy the Lord’s anointed?” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_15"><sup>15</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:6; 26:9">⚓</a>David called one of the young men and said, “Go near, <i>and</i> execute him!” And he struck him so that he died. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_16"><sup>16</sup>So David said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 4:10, 12">⚓</a>“Your blood <i>is</i> on your own head, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:9; 2 Sam. 3:28; 1 Kin. 2:32–37">⚓</a>your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the Lord’s anointed.’ ”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Song of the Bow</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:10; Luke 19:22">⚓</a>and he told <i>them</i> to teach the children of Judah <i>the</i> <i>Song</i> <i>of</i> the Bow; indeed <i>it</i> <i>is</i> written <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:3">⚓</a>in the Book of Jasher:<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_1_19">  <sup>19</sup>“The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places!<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:13">⚓</a>How the mighty have fallen!<br/></span>
