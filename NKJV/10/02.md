<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>David Anointed King of Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>It happened after this that David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:19, 25">⚓</a>inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go up to any of the cities of Judah?”<br/> And the Lord said to him, “Go up.”<br/> David said, “Where shall I go up?”<br/> And He said, “To <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:1; 1 Sam. 23:2, 4, 9; 30:7, 8">⚓</a>Hebron.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_2"> <sup>2</sup>So David went up there, and his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 30:31; 2 Sam. 2:11; 5:1–3; 1 Kin. 2:11">⚓</a>two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_3"><sup>3</sup>And David brought up <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:42, 43; 30:5">⚓</a>the men who <i>were</i> with him, every man with his household. So they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 27:2, 3; 30:1; 1 Chr. 12:1">⚓</a>Then the men of Judah came, and there they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 30:26; 2 Sam. 2:11; 5:5; 19:14, 41–43">⚓</a>anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:13; 2 Sam. 5:3">⚓</a>“The men of Jabesh Gilead <i>were</i> <i>the</i> <i>ones</i> who buried Saul.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_5"><sup>5</sup>So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:11–13">⚓</a>“You <i>are</i> blessed of the Lord, for you have shown this kindness to your lord, to Saul, and have buried him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_6"><sup>6</sup>And now may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 2:20; 3:10">⚓</a>the Lord show kindness and truth to you. I also will repay you this kindness, because you have done this thing. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_7"><sup>7</sup>Now therefore, let your hands be strengthened, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ishbosheth Made King of Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_8"> <sup>8</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:6; 2 Tim. 1:16, 18">⚓</a>Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:50; 2 Sam. 3:6">⚓</a>Mahanaim; </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_9"><sup>9</sup>and he made him king over <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:2; Josh. 21:38; 2 Sam. 17:24">⚓</a>Gilead, over the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 22:9">⚓</a>Ashurites, over <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:32">⚓</a>Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, and over all Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_10"><sup>10</sup>Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, <i>was</i> forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. Only the house of Judah followed David. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_11"><sup>11</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 29:1">⚓</a>the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel and Judah at War</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_12"> <sup>12</sup>Now Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:5; 1 Kin. 2:11">⚓</a>Gibeon. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_13"><sup>13</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:2–12; 18:25">⚓</a>Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out and met them by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:6; 2 Sam. 8:16; 1 Chr. 2:16; 11:6">⚓</a>the pool of Gibeon. So they sat down, one on one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_14"><sup>14</sup>Then Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men now arise and compete before us.”<br/> And Joab said, “Let them arise.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_15"> <sup>15</sup>So they arose and went over by number, twelve from Benjamin, <i>followers</i> of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve from the servants of David. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_16"><sup>16</sup>And each one grasped his opponent by the head and <i>thrust</i> his sword in his opponent’s side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called the Field of Sharp Swords, which <i>is</i> in Gibeon. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_17"><sup>17</sup>So there was a very fierce battle that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_18"> <sup>18</sup>Now the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 41:12">⚓</a>three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab and Abishai and Asahel. And Asahel <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 2:16">⚓</a><i>as</i> fleet of foot <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 12:8; Hab. 3:19">⚓</a>as a wild gazelle. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_19"><sup>19</sup>So Asahel pursued Abner, and in going he did not turn to the right hand or to the left from following Abner.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then Abner looked behind him and said, “<i>Are</i> you Asahel?”<br/> He answered, “I <i>am.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_21"> <sup>21</sup>And Abner said to him, “Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take his armor for yourself.” But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_22"><sup>22</sup>So Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I face your brother Joab?” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_23"><sup>23</sup>However, he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 18:33">⚓</a>in the stomach with the blunt end of the spear, so that the spear came out of his back; and he fell down there and died on the spot. So it was <i>that</i> as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:27; 4:6; 20:10">⚓</a>still.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_24"> <sup>24</sup>Joab and Abishai also pursued Abner. And the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah, which <i>is</i> before Giah by the road to the Wilderness of Gibeon. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_25"><sup>25</sup>Now the children of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became a unit, and took their stand on top of a hill. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_26"><sup>26</sup>Then Abner called to Joab and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the latter end? How long will it be then until you tell the people to return from pursuing their brethren?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_27"> <sup>27</sup>And Joab said, “<i>As</i> God lives, unless <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 20:12">⚓</a>you had spoken, surely then by morning all the people would have given up pursuing their brethren.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_28"><sup>28</sup>So Joab blew a trumpet; and all the people stood still and did not pursue Israel anymore, nor did they fight anymore. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_29"><sup>29</sup>Then Abner and his men went on all that night through the plain, crossed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron; and they came to Mahanaim.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_30"> <sup>30</sup>So Joab returned from pursuing Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of David’s servants nineteen men and Asahel. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_31"><sup>31</sup>But the servants of David had struck down, of Benjamin and Abner’s men, three hundred and sixty men who died. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_2_32"><sup>32</sup>Then they took up Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb, which <i>was</i> <i>in</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:14">⚓</a>Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at daybreak.<br/></span>
