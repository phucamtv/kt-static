<div class="title"><h1>3</h1></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now there was a long <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:6">⚓</a>war between the house of Saul and the house of David. But David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Sons of David</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_2"> <sup>2</sup>Sons were born <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:30; (Ps. 46:9)">⚓</a>to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 3:1–4">⚓</a>by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_3"><sup>3</sup>his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite; the third, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:42, 43">⚓</a>Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:1–10">⚓</a>of Geshur; </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_4"><sup>4</sup>the fourth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 13:13; 1 Sam. 27:8; 2 Sam. 13:37; 14:32; 15:8">⚓</a>Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_5"><sup>5</sup>and the sixth, Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Abner Joins Forces with David</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now it was so, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner was strengthening <i>his</i> <i>hold</i> on the house of Saul.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_7"> <sup>7</sup>And Saul had a concubine, whose name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:5">⚓</a>Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. So <i>Ishbosheth</i> said to Abner, “Why have you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 21:8–11">⚓</a>gone in to my father’s concubine?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Abner became very angry at the words of Ishbosheth, and said, “<i>Am</i> I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:21">⚓</a>a dog’s head that belongs to Judah? Today I show loyalty to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David; and you charge me today with a fault concerning this woman? </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 23:18; 1 Sam. 24:14; 2 Sam. 9:8; 16:9">⚓</a>May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:17; 1 Kin. 19:2">⚓</a>as the Lord has sworn to him— </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_10"><sup>10</sup>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:28; 16:1, 12; 28:17; 1 Chr. 12:23">⚓</a>from Dan to Beersheba.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_11"><sup>11</sup>And he could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to David, saying, “Whose <i>is</i> the land?” saying <i>also,</i> “Make your covenant with me, and indeed my hand <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> with you to bring all Israel to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_13"> <sup>13</sup>And <i>David</i> said, “Good, I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require of you: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:1; 1 Sam. 3:20; 2 Sam. 17:11; 1 Kin. 4:25">⚓</a>you shall not see my face unless you first bring <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:3">⚓</a>Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_14"><sup>14</sup>So David sent messengers to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:20; 19:11; 25:44; 2 Sam. 6:16">⚓</a>Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Give <i>me</i> my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:10">⚓</a>for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_15"><sup>15</sup>And Ishbosheth sent and took her from <i>her</i> husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_16"><sup>16</sup>Then her husband went along with her to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:25–27">⚓</a>Bahurim, weeping behind her. So Abner said to him, “Go, return!” And he returned.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel, saying, “In time past you were seeking for David <i>to</i> <i>be</i> king over you. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_18"><sup>18</sup>Now then, do <i>it!</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:5; 19:16">⚓</a>For the Lord has spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand of My servant David, I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and the hand of all their enemies.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_19"><sup>19</sup>And Abner also spoke in the hearing of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:9">⚓</a>Benjamin. Then Abner also went to speak in the hearing of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_20"> <sup>20</sup>So Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David made a feast for Abner and the men who <i>were</i> with him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_21"><sup>21</sup>Then Abner said to David, “I will arise and go, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:20, 21; 1 Chr. 12:29">⚓</a>gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:10, 12">⚓</a>reign over all that your heart desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Joab Murders Abner</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_22"> <sup>22</sup>At that moment the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much spoil with them. But Abner <i>was</i> not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_23"><sup>23</sup>When Joab and all the troops that <i>were</i> with him had come, they told Joab, saying, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he sent him away, and he has gone in peace.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_24"><sup>24</sup>Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Look, Abner came to you; why <i>is</i> it <i>that</i> you sent him away, and he has already gone? </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_25"><sup>25</sup>Surely you realize that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, to know <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:37">⚓</a>your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_26"> <sup>26</sup>And when Joab had gone from David’s presence, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_27"><sup>27</sup>Now when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:6; 1 Sam. 29:6; Is. 37:28">⚓</a>took him aside in the gate to speak with him privately, and there stabbed him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 20:9, 10; 1 Kin. 2:5">⚓</a>in the stomach, so that he died for the blood of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 4:6">⚓</a>Asahel his brother.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_28"> <sup>28</sup>Afterward, when David heard <i>it,</i> he said, “My kingdom and I <i>are</i> guiltless before the Lord forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_29"><sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:23">⚓</a>Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house; and let there never fail to be in the house of Joab one <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 21:6–9; 1 Kin. 2:32, 33">⚓</a>who has a discharge or is a leper, who leans on a staff or falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_30"><sup>30</sup>So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 15:2">⚓</a>Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David’s Mourning for Abner</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:23">⚓</a>“Tear your clothes, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:6; 2 Sam. 1:2, 11">⚓</a>gird yourselves with sackcloth, and mourn for Abner.” And King David followed the coffin. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_32"><sup>32</sup>So they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_33"><sup>33</sup>And the king sang <i>a</i> <i>lament</i> over Abner and said:<br/>  “Should Abner die as a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:34">⚓</a>fool dies?<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_34">   <sup>34</sup>Your hands were not bound<br/>   Nor your feet put into fetters;<br/>   As a man falls before wicked men, <i>so</i> you fell.”<br/> Then all the people wept over him again.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_35"> <sup>35</sup>And when all the people came <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 13:12, 13">⚓</a>to persuade David to eat food while it was still day, David took an oath, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:17; Jer. 16:7, 8">⚓</a>“God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:17">⚓</a>till the sun goes down!” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_36"><sup>36</sup>Now all the people took note <i>of</i> <i>it,</i> and it pleased them, since whatever the king did pleased all the people. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_37"><sup>37</sup>For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king’s intent to kill Abner the son of Ner. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_38"><sup>38</sup>Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_3_39"><sup>39</sup>And I <i>am</i> weak today, though anointed king; and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:26; 2 Sam. 1:12">⚓</a><i>are</i> too harsh for me. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:5–7">⚓</a>The Lord shall repay the evildoer according to his wickedness.”<br/></span>
