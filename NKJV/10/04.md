<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Ishbosheth Is Murdered</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>When Saul’s son heard that Abner had died in Hebron, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:5, 6, 32–34; 2 Tim. 4:14">⚓</a>he lost heart, and all Israel was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 4:4; Is. 13:7">⚓</a>troubled. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_4_2"><sup>2</sup>Now Saul’s son <i>had</i> two men <i>who</i> <i>were</i> captains of troops. The name of one <i>was</i> Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin. (For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 2:3">⚓</a>Beeroth also was <i>part</i> of Benjamin, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_4_3"><sup>3</sup>because the Beerothites fled to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:25">⚓</a>Gittaim and have been sojourners there until this day.)<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_4_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 11:33">⚓</a>Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son <i>who</i> <i>was</i> lame in <i>his</i> feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 9:3">⚓</a>from Jezreel; and his nurse took him up and fled. And it happened, as she made haste to flee, that he fell and became lame. His name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 29:1, 11">⚓</a>Mephibosheth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_4_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out and came at about the heat of the day to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 9:6">⚓</a>house of Ishbosheth, who was lying on his bed at noon. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_4_6"><sup>6</sup>And they came there, all the way into the house, <i>as</i> <i>though</i> to get wheat, and they stabbed him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:8, 9">⚓</a>in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_4_7"><sup>7</sup>For when they came into the house, he was lying on his bed in his bedroom; then they struck him and killed him, beheaded him and took his head, and were all night escaping through the plain. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_4_8"><sup>8</sup>And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul your enemy, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:23; 20:10">⚓</a>who sought your life; and the Lord has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and his descendants.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_4_9"> <sup>9</sup>But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “<i>As</i> the Lord lives, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:2, 10, 11; 23:15; 25:29">⚓</a>who has redeemed my life from all adversity, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_4_10"><sup>10</sup>when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:16; 1 Kin. 1:29; Ps. 31:7">⚓</a>someone told me, saying, ‘Look, Saul is dead,’ thinking to have brought good news, I arrested him and had him executed in Ziklag—the one who <i>thought</i> I would give him a reward for <i>his</i> news. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_4_11"><sup>11</sup>How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous person in his own house on his bed? Therefore, shall I not now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:2–16">⚓</a>require his blood at your hand and remove you from the earth?” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_4_12"><sup>12</sup>So David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 9:5, 6; Ps. 9:12)">⚓</a>commanded his young men, and they executed them, cut off their hands and feet, and hanged <i>them</i> by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried <i>it</i> in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:15">⚓</a>tomb of Abner in Hebron.<br/></span>
