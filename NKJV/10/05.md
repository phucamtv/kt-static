<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>David Reigns over All Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then all the tribes of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:32">⚓</a>came to David at Hebron and spoke, saying, “Indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 11:1–3">⚓</a>we <i>are</i> your bone and your flesh. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_2"><sup>2</sup>Also, in time past, when Saul was king over us, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 29:14; Judg. 9:2; 2 Sam. 19:12, 13">⚓</a>you were the one who led Israel out and brought them in; and the Lord said to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:5, 13, 16">⚓</a>‘You shall shepherd My people Israel, and be ruler over Israel.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:1">⚓</a>Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:17; 1 Chr. 11:3">⚓</a>and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:4; 3:21; 2 Kin. 11:17">⚓</a>before the Lord. And they anointed David king over Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_4"><sup>4</sup>David <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:11; 1 Sam. 23:18">⚓</a>thirty years old when he began to reign, <i>and</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:46; Num. 4:3; Luke 3:23">⚓</a>he reigned forty years. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_5"><sup>5</sup>In Hebron he reigned over Judah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:11; 1 Chr. 26:31; 29:27">⚓</a>seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Conquest of Jerusalem</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_6"> <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:11; 1 Chr. 3:4; 29:27">⚓</a>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:21">⚓</a>the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, “You shall not come in here; but the blind and the lame will repel you,” thinking, “David cannot come in here.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_7"><sup>7</sup>Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:63; Judg. 1:8; 19:11, 12">⚓</a>(that <i>is,</i> the City of David).<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now David said on that day, “Whoever climbs up by way of the water shaft and defeats the Jebusites (the lame and the blind, <i>who</i> <i>are</i> hated by David’s soul), <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:12, 16; 1 Kin. 2:10; 8:1; 9:24">⚓</a><i>he</i> <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> <i>chief</i> <i>and</i> <i>captain.</i>” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 11:6–9">⚓</a>the City of David. And David built all around from the Millo and inward. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_10"><sup>10</sup>So David went on and became great, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:7; 1 Kin. 9:15, 24">⚓</a>the Lord God of hosts <i>was</i> with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:45">⚓</a>him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:12, 28">⚓</a>Hiram <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:1–18">⚓</a>king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters and masons. And they built David a house. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_12"><sup>12</sup>So David knew that the Lord had established him as king over Israel, and that He had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 14:1">⚓</a>exalted His kingdom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 24:7">⚓</a>for the sake of His people Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_13"> <sup>13</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 45:4">⚓</a>David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron. Also more sons and daughters were born to David. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_14"><sup>14</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 17:17); 1 Chr. 3:9">⚓</a>these <i>are</i> the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 3:5–8">⚓</a>Solomon, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_15"><sup>15</sup>Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_16"><sup>16</sup>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Philistines Defeated</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:24">⚓</a>Now when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. And David heard <i>of</i> <i>it</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 11:16">⚓</a>and went down to the stronghold. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_18"><sup>18</sup>The Philistines also went and deployed themselves in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 23:14">⚓</a>the Valley of Rephaim. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_19"><sup>19</sup>So David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:5; Josh. 15:8; 1 Chr. 11:15; Is. 17:5">⚓</a>inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?”<br/> And the Lord said to David, “Go up, for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into your hand.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_20"> <sup>20</sup>So David went to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 23:2; 2 Sam. 2:1">⚓</a>Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there; and he said, “The Lord has broken through my enemies before me, like a breakthrough of water.” Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_21"><sup>21</sup>And they left their images there, and David and his men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 14:11; Is. 28:21">⚓</a>carried them away.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_22"> <sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:5, 25">⚓</a>Then the Philistines went up once again and deployed themselves in the Valley of Rephaim. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_23"><sup>23</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 14:13">⚓</a>David inquired of the Lord, and He said, “You shall not go up; circle around behind them, and come upon them in front of the mulberry trees. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_24"><sup>24</sup>And it shall be, when you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:19">⚓</a>hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then you shall advance quickly. For then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 7:6; 1 Chr. 14:15">⚓</a>the Lord will go out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_5_25"><sup>25</sup>And David did so, as the Lord commanded him; and he drove back the Philistines from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 4:14">⚓</a>Geba as far as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 14:16">⚓</a>Gezer.<br/></span>
