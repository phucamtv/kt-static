<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>The Ark Brought to Jerusalem</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>Again David gathered all <i>the</i> choice <i>men</i> of Israel, thirty thousand. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_2"><sup>2</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:10">⚓</a>David arose and went with all the people who <i>were</i> with him from Baale Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, whose name is called by the Name, the Lord of Hosts, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 13:5, 6">⚓</a>who dwells <i>between</i> the cherubim. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_3"><sup>3</sup>So they set the ark of God on a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which <i>was</i> on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:22; 1 Sam. 4:4; Ps. 80:1">⚓</a>the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_4"><sup>4</sup>And they brought it out of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:1">⚓</a>the house of Abinadab, which <i>was</i> on the hill, accompanying the ark of God; and Ahio went before the ark. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_5"><sup>5</sup>Then David and all the house of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:1; 1 Chr. 13:7">⚓</a>played <i>music</i> before the Lord on all kinds of <i>instruments</i> <i>of</i> fir wood, on harps, on stringed instruments, on tambourines, on sistrums, and on cymbals.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_6"> <sup>6</sup>And when they came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:6, 7">⚓</a>Nachon’s threshing floor, Uzzah put out <i>his</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 13:9">⚓</a>hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_7"><sup>7</sup>Then the anger of the Lord was aroused against Uzzah, and God struck him there for <i>his</i> error; and he died there by the ark of God. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_8"><sup>8</sup>And David became angry because of the Lord’s outbreak against Uzzah; and he called the name of the place Perez Uzzah to this day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 4:15, 19, 20">⚓</a>David was afraid of the Lord that day; and he said, “How can the ark of the Lord come to me?” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_10"><sup>10</sup>So David would not move the ark of the Lord with him into the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:19; Ps. 119:120; Luke 5:8">⚓</a>City of David; but David took it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:7">⚓</a>Gittite. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 13:13; 26:4–8">⚓</a>The ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months. And the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 13:14">⚓</a>blessed Obed-Edom and all his household.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_12"> <sup>12</sup>Now it was told King David, saying, “The Lord has blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that <i>belongs</i> to him, because of the ark of God.” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:27; 39:5">⚓</a>So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with gladness. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_13"><sup>13</sup>And so it was, when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 15:25—16:3">⚓</a>those bearing the ark of the Lord had gone six paces, that he sacrificed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 4:15; Josh. 3:3; 1 Sam. 6:15; 2 Sam. 15:24; 1 Chr. 15:2, 15">⚓</a>oxen and fatted sheep. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_14"><sup>14</sup>Then David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:5">⚓</a>danced before the Lord with all <i>his</i> might; and David <i>was</i> wearing <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 30:11; 149:3">⚓</a>a linen ephod. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:18, 28">⚓</a>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_16"> <sup>16</sup>Now as the ark of the Lord came into the City of David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 15:28">⚓</a>Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked through a window and saw King David leaping and whirling before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_17"><sup>17</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:14">⚓</a>they brought the ark of the Lord, and set it in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 16:1">⚓</a>its place in the midst of the tabernacle that David had erected for it. Then David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 15:1; 2 Chr. 1:4">⚓</a>offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_18"><sup>18</sup>And when David had finished offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:5, 62, 63">⚓</a>he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of hosts. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:14, 15, 55">⚓</a>Then he distributed among all the people, among the whole multitude of Israel, both the women and the men, to everyone a loaf of bread, a piece <i>of</i> <i>meat,</i> and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed, everyone to his house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 16:3">⚓</a>Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, “How glorious was the king of Israel today, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 30:title">⚓</a>uncovering himself today in the eyes of the maids of his servants, as one of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:14, 16">⚓</a>base fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_21"> <sup>21</sup>So David said to Michal, “<i>It</i> <i>was</i> before the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:4">⚓</a>who chose me instead of your father and all his house, to appoint me ruler over the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:14; 15:28">⚓</a>people of the Lord, over Israel. Therefore I will play <i>music</i> before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_22"><sup>22</sup>And I will be even more undignified than this, and will be humble in my own sight. But as for the maidservants of whom you have spoken, by them I will be held in honor.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_6_23"> <sup>23</sup>Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no children <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 11:17">⚓</a>to the day of her death.<br/></span>
