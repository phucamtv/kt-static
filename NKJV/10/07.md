<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>God’s Covenant with David</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:35; Is. 22:14">⚓</a>when the king was dwelling in his house, and the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies all around, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_2"><sup>2</sup>that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 17:1–27">⚓</a>a house of cedar, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:11">⚓</a>but the ark of God dwells inside tent <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:46">⚓</a>curtains.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then Nathan said to the king, “Go, do all that <i>is</i> in your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 26:1">⚓</a>heart, for the Lord<i>is</i> with you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_4"> <sup>4</sup>But it happened that night that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_5"><sup>5</sup>“Go and tell My servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:17, 18; 1 Chr. 22:7">⚓</a>“Would you build a house for Me to dwell in? </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_6"><sup>6</sup>For I have not dwelt in a house <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:3, 4; 8:19; 1 Chr. 22:8">⚓</a>since the time that I brought the children of Israel up from Egypt, even to this day, but have moved about in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:1; 1 Kin. 8:16">⚓</a>a tent and in a tabernacle. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_7"><sup>7</sup>Wherever I have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 40:18, 34">⚓</a>moved about with all the children of Israel, have I ever spoken a word to anyone from the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:11, 12">⚓</a>to shepherd My people Israel, saying, ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’ ” ’ </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_8"><sup>8</sup>Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:2; (Acts 20:28)">⚓</a>“I took you from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people, over Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_9"><sup>9</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:11, 12; Ps. 78:70, 71">⚓</a>I have been with you wherever you have gone, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:14; 2 Sam. 5:10">⚓</a>and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a great name, like the name of the great men who <i>are</i> on the earth. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_10"><sup>10</sup>Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:6">⚓</a>plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:17; Ps. 44:2; 80:8; Jer. 24:6">⚓</a>nor shall the sons of wickedness oppress them anymore, as previously, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 89:22, 23; Is. 60:18">⚓</a>since the time that I commanded judges <i>to</i> <i>be</i> over My people Israel, and have caused you to rest from all your enemies. Also the Lord tells you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:14–16">⚓</a>that He will make you a house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:21; 1 Sam. 25:28; 2 Sam. 7:27">⚓</a>“When your days are fulfilled and you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:1">⚓</a>rest with your fathers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:16; Acts 13:36">⚓</a>I will set up your seed after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. </span>

<span class="verse 2sa_7_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:16; (Is. 9:7; 49:8)">⚓</a>I will be his Father, and he shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 1:5)">⚓</a>My son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of men. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_15"><sup>15</sup>But My mercy shall not depart from him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 2:7; 89:26, 27, 30); Matt. 3:17">⚓</a>as I took <i>it</i> from Saul, whom I removed from before you. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_16"><sup>16</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:23, 28; 16:14">⚓</a>your house and your kingdom shall be established forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_17"> <sup>17</sup>According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David’s Thanksgiving to God</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then King David went in and sat before the Lord; and he said: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:13; Ps. 89:36, 37; Matt. 25:31; John 12:34">⚓</a>“Who <i>am</i> I, O Lord God? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far? </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_19"><sup>19</sup>And yet this was a small thing in Your sight, O Lord God; and You have also spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:10; Ex. 3:11; 1 Sam. 18:18">⚓</a><i>Is</i> this the manner of man, O Lord God? </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_20"><sup>20</sup>Now what more can David say to You? For You, Lord God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 55:8, 9)">⚓</a>know Your servant. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_21"><sup>21</sup>For Your word’s sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all these great things, to make Your servant know <i>them.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_22"><sup>22</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Sam. 16:7); Ps. 139:1; John 21:17">⚓</a>You are great, O Lord God. For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 10:17; 1 Chr. 16:25; 2 Chr. 2:5; Ps. 86:10; Jer. 10:6">⚓</a><i>there</i> <i>is</i> none like You, nor <i>is</i> <i>there</i> <i>any</i> God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:11; Deut. 3:24; 4:35; 32:39">⚓</a>ears. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_23"><sup>23</sup>And who <i>is</i> like Your people, like Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 10:2; Ps. 44:1">⚓</a>the one nation on the earth whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people, to make for Himself a name—and to do for Yourself great and awesome deeds for Your land—before <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 147:20">⚓</a>Your people whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, the nations, and their gods? </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_24"><sup>24</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:26; 33:29">⚓</a>You have made Your people Israel Your very own people forever; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:7, 8; Ex. 6:7; (Deut. 26:18)">⚓</a>and You, Lord, have become their God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_25"> <sup>25</sup>“Now, O Lord God, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, establish <i>it</i> forever and do as You have said. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_26"><sup>26</sup>So let Your name be magnified forever, saying, ‘The Lord of hosts <i>is</i> the God over Israel.’ And let the house of Your servant David be established before You. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_27"><sup>27</sup>For You, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed <i>this</i> to Your servant, saying, ‘I will build you a house.’ Therefore Your servant has found it in his heart to pray this prayer to You.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_28"> <sup>28</sup>“And now, O Lord God, You are God, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 48:14">⚓</a>Your words are true, and You have promised this goodness to Your servant. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_7_29"><sup>29</sup>Now therefore, let it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue before You forever; for You, O Lord God, have spoken <i>it,</i> and with Your blessing let the house of Your servant be blessed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:6; Josh. 21:45; John 17:17">⚓</a>forever.”<br/></span>
