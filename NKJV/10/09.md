<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>David’s Kindness to Mephibosheth</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now David said, “Is there still anyone who is left of the house of Saul, that I may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 30:14; 1 Kin. 1:38">⚓</a>show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_9_2"> <sup>2</sup>And <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a servant of the house of Saul whose name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:3; 20:14–16; 2 Sam. 21:7; (Prov. 27:10)">⚓</a>Ziba. So when they had called him to David, the king said to him, “<i>Are</i> you Ziba?”<br/> He said, “At your service!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_9_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then the king said, “<i>Is</i> there not still someone of the house of Saul, to whom I may show <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:1–4; 19:17, 29">⚓</a>the kindness of God?”<br/> And Ziba said to the king, “There is still a son of Jonathan <i>who</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 20:14">⚓</a>lame in <i>his</i> feet.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_9_4"> <sup>4</sup>So the king said to him, “Where <i>is</i> he?”<br/> And Ziba said to the king, “Indeed he <i>is</i> in the house of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 4:4">⚓</a>Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_9_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then King David sent and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_9_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:27–29">⚓</a>Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, had come to David, he fell on his face and prostrated himself. Then David said, “Mephibosheth?”<br/> And he answered, “Here is your servant!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_9_7"> <sup>7</sup>So David said to him, “Do not fear, for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your grandfather; and you shall eat bread at my table continually.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_9_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then he bowed himself, and said, “What <i>is</i> your servant, that you should look upon such <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:4; 19:24–30">⚓</a>a dead dog as I?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_9_9"> <sup>9</sup>And the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:9">⚓</a>“I have given to your master’s son all that belonged to Saul and to all his house. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_9_10"><sup>10</sup>You therefore, and your sons and your servants, shall work the land for him, and you shall bring in <i>the</i> <i>harvest,</i> that your master’s son may have food to eat. But Mephibosheth your master’s son <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:4; 19:29">⚓</a>shall eat bread at my table always.” Now Ziba had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 9:7, 11, 13; 19:28">⚓</a>fifteen sons and twenty servants.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_9_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so will your servant do.”<br/> “As for Mephibosheth,” <i>said</i> <i>the</i> <i>king,</i> “he shall eat at my table like one of the king’s sons.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_9_12"><sup>12</sup>Mephibosheth had a young son <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:17">⚓</a>whose name <i>was</i> Micha. And all who dwelt in the house of Ziba <i>were</i> servants of Mephibosheth. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_9_13"><sup>13</sup>So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 8:34">⚓</a>for he ate continually at the king’s table. And he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 9:7, 10, 11; 1 Kin. 2:7; 2 Kin. 25:29">⚓</a>was lame in both his feet.<br/></span>
