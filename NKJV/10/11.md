<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>David, Bathsheba, and Uriah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>It happened in the spring of the year, at the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:6">⚓</a>time when kings go out <i>to</i> <i>battle,</i> that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 20:22–26">⚓</a>David sent Joab and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the people of Ammon and besieged <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 20:1">⚓</a>Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_2"> <sup>2</sup>Then it happened one evening that David arose from his bed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:26; Jer. 49:2, 3; Amos 1:14">⚓</a>and walked on the roof of the king’s house. And from the roof he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 22:8; 1 Sam. 9:25; Matt. 24:17; Acts 10:9">⚓</a>saw a woman bathing, and the woman <i>was</i> very beautiful to behold. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_3"><sup>3</sup>So David sent and inquired about the woman. And <i>someone</i> said, “<i>Is</i> this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:2; (Ex. 20:17); Job 31:1; (Matt. 5:28)">⚓</a>of Uriah the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 23:39">⚓</a>Hittite?” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_4"><sup>4</sup>Then David sent messengers, and took her; and she came to him, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:6">⚓</a>he lay with her, for she was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 20:10; Deut. 22:22); Ps. 51:title; (James 1:14, 15)">⚓</a>cleansed from her impurity; and she returned to her house. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_5"><sup>5</sup>And the woman conceived; so she sent and told David, and said, “I <i>am</i> with child.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then David sent to Joab, <i>saying,</i> “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” And Joab sent Uriah to David. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_7"><sup>7</sup>When Uriah had come to him, David asked how Joab was doing, and how the people were doing, and how the war prospered. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_8"><sup>8</sup>And David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 15:19, 28">⚓</a>wash your feet.” So Uriah departed from the king’s house, and a gift <i>of</i> <i>food</i> from the king followed him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_9"><sup>9</sup>But Uriah slept at the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:4; 19:2">⚓</a>door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_10"><sup>10</sup>So when they told David, saying, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Did you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_11"> <sup>11</sup>And Uriah said to David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:27, 28">⚓</a>“The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:2, 6">⚓</a>my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields. Shall I then go to my house to eat and drink, and to lie with my wife? <i>As</i> you live, and <i>as</i> your soul lives, I will not do this thing.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then David said to Uriah, “Wait here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_13"><sup>13</sup>Now when David called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 20:6–22">⚓</a>drunk. And at evening he went out to lie on his bed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:33, 35">⚓</a>with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_14"> <sup>14</sup>In the morning it happened that David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 11:9">⚓</a>wrote a letter to Joab and sent <i>it</i> by the hand of Uriah. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_15"><sup>15</sup>And he wrote in the letter, saying, “Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:8, 9">⚓</a>be struck down and die.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_16"><sup>16</sup>So it was, while Joab besieged the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew there <i>were</i> valiant men. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_17"><sup>17</sup>Then the men of the city came out and fought with Joab. And <i>some</i> of the people of the servants of David fell; and Uriah the Hittite died also.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_19"><sup>19</sup>and charged the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling the matters of the war to the king, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_20"><sup>20</sup>if it happens that the king’s wrath rises, and he says to you: ‘Why did you approach so near to the city when you fought? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall? </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_21"><sup>21</sup>Who struck <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:9">⚓</a>Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Was it not a woman who cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you go near the wall?’—then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_22"> <sup>22</sup>So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent by him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_23"><sup>23</sup>And the messenger said to David, “Surely the men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field; then we drove them back as far as the entrance of the gate. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_24"><sup>24</sup>The archers shot from the wall at your servants; and <i>some</i> of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall say to Joab: ‘Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your attack against the city, and overthrow it.’ So encourage him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_26"> <sup>26</sup>When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_11_27"><sup>27</sup>And when her mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:50–54">⚓</a>became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:9">⚓</a>displeased the Lord.<br/></span>
