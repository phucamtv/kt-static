<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>Nathan’s Parable and David’s Confession</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the Lord sent Nathan to David. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 21:7; (Heb. 13:4)">⚓</a>he came to him, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 51:title">⚓</a>said to him: “There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_2"><sup>2</sup>The rich <i>man</i> had exceedingly many flocks and herds. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_3"><sup>3</sup>But the poor <i>man</i> had nothing, except one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished; and it grew up together with him and with his children. It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup and lay in his bosom; and it was like a daughter to him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_4"><sup>4</sup>And a traveler came to the rich man, who refused to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare one for the wayfaring man who had come to him; but he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_5"> <sup>5</sup>So David’s anger was greatly aroused against the man, and he said to Nathan, “<i>As</i> the Lord lives, the man who has done this shall surely die! </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_6"><sup>6</sup>And he shall restore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 20:35–41">⚓</a>fourfold for the lamb, because he did this thing and because he had no pity.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then Nathan said to David, “You <i>are</i> the man! Thus says the Lord God of Israel: ‘I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 22:1); Luke 19:8">⚓</a>anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_8"><sup>8</sup>I gave you your master’s house and your master’s wives into your keeping, and gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if <i>that</i> <i>had</i> <i>been</i> too little, I also would have given you much more! </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:13; 2 Sam. 5:3">⚓</a>Why have you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:19">⚓</a>despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in His sight? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 15:31">⚓</a>You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword; you have taken his wife <i>to</i> <i>be</i> your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the people of Ammon. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_10"><sup>10</sup>Now therefore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 11:14–17, 27">⚓</a>the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’ </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_11"><sup>11</sup>Thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, I will raise up adversity against you from your own house; and I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 13:28; 18:14; 1 Kin. 2:25; (Amos 7:9)">⚓</a>take your wives before your eyes and give <i>them</i> to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_12"><sup>12</sup>For you did <i>it</i> secretly, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:30; 2 Sam. 16:21, 22">⚓</a>but I will do this thing before all Israel, before the sun.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:22">⚓</a>So David said to Nathan, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:24">⚓</a>“I have sinned against the Lord.”<br/> And Nathan said to David, “The Lord also has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:10; Job 7:20; Ps. 51; Luke 18:13">⚓</a>put away your sin; you shall not die. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_14"><sup>14</sup>However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:10; Job 7:21; (Ps. 32:1–5; Prov. 28:13; Mic. 7:18); Zech. 3:4">⚓</a>to blaspheme, the child also <i>who</i> <i>is</i> born to you shall surely die.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_15"><sup>15</sup>Then Nathan departed to his house.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Death of David’s Son</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_15"> And the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 52:5; (Ezek. 36:20, 23); Rom. 2:24">⚓</a>Lord struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and it became ill. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_16"><sup>16</sup>David therefore pleaded with God for the child, and David fasted and went in and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:38">⚓</a>lay all night on the ground. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_17"><sup>17</sup>So the elders of his house arose <i>and</i> <i>went</i> to him, to raise him up from the ground. But he would not, nor did he eat food with them. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_18"><sup>18</sup>Then on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. For they said, “Indeed, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not heed our voice. How can we tell him that the child is dead? He may do some harm!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_19"> <sup>19</sup>When David saw that his servants were whispering, David perceived that the child was dead. Therefore David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?”<br/> And they said, “He is dead.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_20"> <sup>20</sup>So David arose from the ground, washed and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 13:31">⚓</a>anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the Lord and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 3:3; Matt. 6:17">⚓</a>worshiped. Then he went to his own house; and when he requested, they set food before him, and he ate. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_21"><sup>21</sup>Then his servants said to him, “What <i>is</i> this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child <i>while</i> <i>he</i> <i>was</i> alive, but when the child died, you arose and ate food.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_22"> <sup>22</sup>And he said, “While the child was alive, I fasted and wept; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:20">⚓</a>for I said, ‘Who can tell <i>whether</i> the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?’ </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_23"><sup>23</sup>But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 38:1–5; Joel 2:14; Jon. 3:9">⚓</a>to him, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:35">⚓</a>he shall not return to me.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Solomon Is Born</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her and lay with her. So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 7:8–10">⚓</a>she bore a son, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:6">⚓</a>he called his name Solomon. Now the Lord loved him, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_25"><sup>25</sup>and He sent <i>word</i> by the hand of Nathan the prophet: So he called his name Jedidiah, because of the Lord.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Rabbah Is Captured</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_26"> <sup>26</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 22:9">⚓</a>Joab fought against <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 20:1">⚓</a>Rabbah of the people of Ammon, and took the royal city. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_27"><sup>27</sup>And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah, and I have taken the city’s water <i>supply.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_28"><sup>28</sup>Now therefore, gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called after my name.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_29"><sup>29</sup>So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, fought against it, and took it. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:11; 2 Sam. 11:1">⚓</a>Then he took their king’s crown from his head. Its weight <i>was</i> a talent of gold, with precious stones. And it was <i>set</i> on David’s head. Also he brought out the spoil of the city in great abundance. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_12_31"><sup>31</sup>And he brought out the people who <i>were</i> in it, and put <i>them</i> <i>to</i> <i>work</i> with saws and iron picks and iron axes, and made them cross over to the brick works. So he did to all the cities of the people of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.<br/></span>
