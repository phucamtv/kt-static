<div class="title"><h1>13</h1><h3>Amnon and Tamar</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>After this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 20:2">⚓</a>Absalom the son of David had a lovely sister, whose name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:2, 3; 1 Chr. 3:2">⚓</a>Tamar; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 3:9">⚓</a>Amnon the son of David loved her. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_2"><sup>2</sup>Amnon was so distressed over his sister Tamar that he became sick; for she <i>was</i> a virgin. And it was improper for Amnon to do anything to her. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_3"><sup>3</sup>But Amnon had a friend whose name <i>was</i> Jonadab <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:2">⚓</a>the son of Shimeah, David’s brother. Now Jonadab <i>was</i> a very crafty man. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_4"><sup>4</sup>And he said to him, “Why <i>are</i> you, the king’s son, becoming thinner day after day? Will you not tell me?”<br/> Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_5"> <sup>5</sup>So Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill. And when your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me food, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see <i>it</i> and eat it from her hand.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_6"><sup>6</sup>Then Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let Tamar my sister come and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:9">⚓</a>make a couple of cakes for me in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_7"> <sup>7</sup>And David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Now go to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_8"><sup>8</sup>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down. Then she took flour and kneaded <i>it,</i> made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_9"><sup>9</sup>And she took the pan and placed <i>them</i> out before him, but he refused to eat. Then Amnon said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:6">⚓</a>“Have everyone go out from me.” And they all went out from him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_10"><sup>10</sup>Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, that I may eat from your hand.” And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought <i>them</i> to Amnon her brother in the bedroom. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_11"><sup>11</sup>Now when she had brought <i>them</i> to him to eat, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:1">⚓</a>he took hold of her and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_12"> <sup>12</sup>But she answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:12; (Deut. 27:22); Ezek. 22:11">⚓</a>no such thing should be done in Israel. Do not do this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 18:9–11; 20:17)">⚓</a>disgraceful thing! </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_13"><sup>13</sup>And I, where could I take my shame? And as for you, you would be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:7; Judg. 19:23; 20:6">⚓</a>for he will not withhold me from you.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_14"><sup>14</sup>However, he would not heed her voice; and being stronger than she, he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:12">⚓</a>forced her and lay with her.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred with which he hated her <i>was</i> greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, “Arise, be gone!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_16"> <sup>16</sup>So she said to him, “No, indeed! This evil of sending me away <i>is</i> worse than the other that you did to me.”<br/> But he would not listen to her. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_17"><sup>17</sup>Then he called his servant who attended him, and said, “Here! Put this <i>woman</i> out, away from me, and bolt the door behind her.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_18"><sup>18</sup>Now she had on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 18:9; (Deut. 22:25; 27:22); 2 Sam. 12:11">⚓</a>a robe of many colors, for the king’s virgin daughters wore such apparel. And his servant put her out and bolted the door behind her.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then Tamar put <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:3; Judg. 5:30; Ps. 45:13, 14">⚓</a>ashes on her head, and tore her robe of many colors that <i>was</i> on her, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:6; 2 Sam. 1:2; Job 2:12; 42:6">⚓</a>laid her hand on her head and went away crying bitterly. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_20"><sup>20</sup>And Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He <i>is</i> your brother; do not take this thing to heart.” So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_21"> <sup>21</sup>But when King David heard of all these things, he was very angry. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_22"><sup>22</sup>And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 2:37">⚓</a>neither good nor bad. For Absalom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:50; 31:24">⚓</a>hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Absalom Murders Amnon</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_23"> <sup>23</sup>And it came to pass, after two full years, that Absalom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 19:17, 18; 1 John 2:9, 11; 3:10, 12, 15)">⚓</a>had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which <i>is</i> near Ephraim; so Absalom invited all the king’s sons. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_24"><sup>24</sup>Then Absalom came to the king and said, “Kindly note, your servant has sheepshearers; please, let the king and his servants go with your servant.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_25"> <sup>25</sup>But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let us not all go now, lest we be a burden to you.” Then he urged him, but he would not go; and he blessed him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.”<br/> And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_27"><sup>27</sup>But Absalom urged him; so he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_28"> <sup>28</sup>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, “Watch now, when Amnon’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 38:12, 13; 1 Sam. 25:4">⚓</a>heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon!’ then kill him. Do not be afraid. Have I not commanded you? Be courageous and valiant.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_29"><sup>29</sup>So the servants of Absalom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 19:6, 9, 22; Ruth 3:7; 1 Sam. 25:36; Esth. 1:10">⚓</a>did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and each one got on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:10">⚓</a>his mule and fled.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_30"> <sup>30</sup>And it came to pass, while they were on the way, that news came to David, saying, “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left!” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_31"><sup>31</sup>So the king arose and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 18:9; 1 Kin. 1:33, 38">⚓</a>tore his garments and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:11">⚓</a>lay on the ground, and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_32"><sup>32</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:16">⚓</a>Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered and said, “Let not my lord suppose they have killed all the young men, the king’s sons, for only Amnon is dead. For by the command of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_33"><sup>33</sup>Now therefore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 13:3–5">⚓</a>let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead. For only Amnon is dead.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Absalom Flees to Geshur</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_34"> <sup>34</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:19">⚓</a>Then Absalom fled. And the young man who was keeping watch lifted his eyes and looked, and there, many people were coming from the road on the hillside behind him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_35"><sup>35</sup>And Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the king’s sons are coming; as your servant said, so it is.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_36"><sup>36</sup>So it was, as soon as he had finished speaking, that the king’s sons indeed came, and they lifted up their voice and wept. Also the king and all his servants wept very bitterly.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_37"> <sup>37</sup>But Absalom fled and went to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 13:37, 38">⚓</a>Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And <i>David</i> mourned for his son every day. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_38"><sup>38</sup>So Absalom fled and went to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:3; 1 Chr. 3:2">⚓</a>Geshur, and was there three years. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_13_39"><sup>39</sup>And King David longed to go to Absalom. For he had been <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 14:23, 32; 15:8">⚓</a>comforted concerning Amnon, because he was dead.<br/></span>
