<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>Absalom’s Treason</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>After this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:4; 45:15; Luke 15:20">⚓</a>it happened that Absalom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:11">⚓</a>provided himself with chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_2"><sup>2</sup>Now Absalom would rise early and stand beside the way to the gate. <i>So</i> it was, whenever anyone who had a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:5">⚓</a>lawsuit came to the king for a decision, that Absalom would call to him and say, “What city <i>are</i> you from?” And he would say, “Your servant <i>is</i> from such and such a tribe of Israel.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Absalom would say to him, “Look, your case <i>is</i> good and right; but <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no deputy of the king to hear you.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_4"><sup>4</sup>Moreover Absalom would say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 19:17">⚓</a>“Oh, that I were made judge in the land, and everyone who has any suit or cause would come to me; then I would give him justice.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_5"><sup>5</sup>And <i>so</i> it was, whenever anyone came near to bow down to him, that he would put out his hand and take him and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:29">⚓</a>kiss him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_6"><sup>6</sup>In this manner Absalom acted toward all Israel who came to the king for judgment. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 14:33; 20:9">⚓</a>So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now it came to pass <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 16:18)">⚓</a>after forty years that Absalom said to the king, “Please, let me go to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 23:21)">⚓</a>Hebron and pay the vow which I made to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:2, 3">⚓</a>For your servant <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:2">⚓</a>took a vow <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:20, 21">⚓</a>while I dwelt at Geshur in Syria, saying, ‘If the Lord indeed brings me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_9"> <sup>9</sup>And the king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose and went to Hebron.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, ‘Absalom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 13:38">⚓</a>reigns in Hebron!’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_11"><sup>11</sup>And with Absalom went two hundred men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:34; 2 Kin. 9:13">⚓</a>invited from Jerusalem, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:3, 5">⚓</a>went along innocently and did not know anything. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_12"><sup>12</sup>Then Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:5">⚓</a>David’s counselor, from his city—from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:15; 1 Chr. 27:33; Ps. 41:9; 55:12–14">⚓</a>Giloh—while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy grew strong, for the people with Absalom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:51">⚓</a>continually increased in number.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David Escapes from Jerusalem</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now a messenger came to David, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 3:1">⚓</a>“The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_14"> <sup>14</sup>So David said to all his servants who <i>were</i> with him at Jerusalem, “Arise, and let us <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:3; 2 Sam. 15:6">⚓</a>flee, or we shall not escape from Absalom. Make haste to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly and bring disaster upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_15"> <sup>15</sup>And the king’s servants said to the king, “We <i>are</i> your servants, <i>ready</i> <i>to</i> <i>do</i> whatever my lord the king commands.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_16"><sup>16</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:11; Ps. 3:title">⚓</a>the king went out with all his household after him. But the king left <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 3:title">⚓</a>ten women, concubines, to keep the house. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_17"><sup>17</sup>And the king went out with all the people after him, and stopped at the outskirts. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_18"><sup>18</sup>Then all his servants passed before him; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:11; 16:21, 22">⚓</a>and all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:18">⚓</a>six hundred men who had followed him from Gath, passed before the king.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then the king said to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 23:13; 25:13; 30:1, 9">⚓</a>Ittai the Gittite, “Why are you also going with us? Return and remain with the king. For you <i>are</i> a foreigner and also an exile from your own place. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_20"><sup>20</sup>In fact, you came <i>only</i> yesterday. Should I make you wander up and down with us today, since I go <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 18:2">⚓</a>I know not where? Return, and take your brethren back. Mercy and truth <i>be</i> with you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_21"> <sup>21</sup>But Ittai answered the king and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 23:13">⚓</a>“<i>As</i> the Lord lives, and <i>as</i> my lord the king lives, surely in whatever place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also your servant will be.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_22"> <sup>22</sup>So David said to Ittai, “Go, and cross over.” Then Ittai the Gittite and all his men and all the little ones who <i>were</i> with him crossed over. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_23"><sup>23</sup>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people crossed over. The king himself also crossed over the Brook Kidron, and all the people crossed over toward the way of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:16, 17; (Prov. 17:17)">⚓</a>wilderness.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_24"> <sup>24</sup>There was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:28; 16:2">⚓</a>Zadok also, and all the Levites with him, bearing the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:17">⚓</a>ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 4:15; 1 Sam. 4:4">⚓</a>Abiathar went up until all the people had finished crossing over from the city. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_25"><sup>25</sup>Then the king said to Zadok, “Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord, He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 22:20">⚓</a>will bring me back and show me <i>both</i> it and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 43:3)">⚓</a>His dwelling place. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_26"><sup>26</sup>But if He says thus: ‘I have no <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:13; Jer. 25:30">⚓</a>delight in you,’ here I am, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:8; 2 Sam. 22:20; 1 Kin. 10:9; 2 Chr. 9:8; Is. 62:4">⚓</a>let Him do to me as seems good to Him.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_27"><sup>27</sup>The king also said to Zadok the priest, “<i>Are</i> you <i>not</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:18">⚓</a>seer? Return to the city in peace, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:6–9">⚓</a>your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_28"><sup>28</sup>See, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:17–20">⚓</a>I will wait in the plains of the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_29"><sup>29</sup>Therefore Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem. And they remained there.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_30"> <sup>30</sup>So David went up by the Ascent of the <i>Mount</i> <i>of</i> Olives, and wept as he went up; and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:10; 2 Sam. 17:16">⚓</a>had his head covered and went <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:4; Esth. 6:12; Ezek. 24:17, 23">⚓</a>barefoot. And all the people who <i>were</i> with him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 20:2–4">⚓</a>covered their heads and went up, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 14:3, 4">⚓</a>weeping as they went up. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_31"><sup>31</sup>Then <i>someone</i> told David, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 126:6)">⚓</a>“Ahithophel <i>is</i> among the conspirators with Absalom.” And David said, “O Lord, I pray, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 3:1, 2; 55:12">⚓</a>turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_32"> <sup>32</sup>Now it happened when David had come to the top <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>mountain,</i> where he worshiped God—there was Hushai the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:23; 17:14, 23">⚓</a>Archite coming to meet him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:2">⚓</a>with his robe torn and dust on his head. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_33"><sup>33</sup>David said to him, “If you go on with me, then you will become <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:2">⚓</a>a burden to me. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_34"><sup>34</sup>But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:35">⚓</a>‘I will be your servant, O king; <i>as</i> I <i>was</i> your father’s servant previously, so I <i>will</i> now also <i>be</i> your servant,’ then you may defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for me. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_35"><sup>35</sup>And <i>do</i> you not <i>have</i> Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? Therefore it will be <i>that</i> whatever you hear from the king’s house, you shall tell to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:19">⚓</a>Zadok and Abiathar the priests. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_36"><sup>36</sup>Indeed <i>they</i> <i>have</i> there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:15, 16">⚓</a>with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s <i>son,</i> and Jonathan, Abiathar’s <i>son;</i> and by them you shall send me everything you hear.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_15_37"> <sup>37</sup>So Hushai, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:27">⚓</a>David’s friend, went into the city. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:16; 1 Chr. 27:33">⚓</a>And Absalom came into Jerusalem.<br/></span>
