<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>Mephibosheth’s Servant</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>When<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:15">⚓</a> David was a little past the top <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>mountain,</i> there was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:30, 32">⚓</a>Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth, who met him with a couple of saddled donkeys, and on them two hundred <i>loaves</i> of bread, one hundred clusters of raisins, one hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_2"><sup>2</sup>And the king said to Ziba, “What do you mean to do with these?”<br/> So Ziba said, “The donkeys <i>are</i> for the king’s household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 9:2; 19:17, 29">⚓</a>those who are faint in the wilderness to drink.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then the king said, “And where <i>is</i> your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:23; 17:29">⚓</a>master’s son?”<br/> <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 9:9, 10">⚓</a>And Ziba said to the king, “Indeed he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will restore the kingdom of my father to me.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_4"> <sup>4</sup>So the king said to Ziba, “Here, all that <i>belongs</i> to Mephibosheth <i>is</i> yours.”<br/> And Ziba said, “I humbly bow before you, <i>that</i> I may find favor in your sight, my lord, O king!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Shimei Curses David</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now when King David came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:27">⚓</a>Bahurim, there was a man from the family of the house of Saul, whose name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:16">⚓</a>Shimei the son of Gera, coming from there. He came out, cursing continuously as he came. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_6"><sup>6</sup>And he threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David. And all the people and all the mighty men <i>were</i> on his right hand and on his left. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_7"><sup>7</sup>Also Shimei said thus when he cursed: “Come out! Come out! You bloodthirsty man, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:21; 1 Kin. 2:8, 9, 44–46">⚓</a>you rogue! </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_8"><sup>8</sup>The Lord has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:13">⚓</a>brought upon you all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:24, 56, 57; 1 Kin. 2:32, 33">⚓</a>the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the Lord has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son. So now you <i>are</i> <i>caught</i> in your own evil, because you are a bloodthirsty man!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:16; 3:28, 29; 4:11, 12">⚓</a>dead dog <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:14; 2 Sam. 9:8">⚓</a>curse my lord the king? Please, let me go over and take off his head!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_10"> <sup>10</sup>But the king said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:28">⚓</a>“What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:39; 19:22; (1 Pet. 2:23)">⚓</a>the Lord has said to him, ‘Curse David.’ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:25; (Lam. 3:38)">⚓</a>Who then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_11"> <sup>11</sup>And David said to Abishai and all his servants, “See how <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 9:20)">⚓</a>my son who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:11">⚓</a>came from my own body seeks my life. How much more now <i>may</i> <i>this</i> Benjamite? Let him alone, and let him curse; for so the Lord has ordered him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_12"><sup>12</sup>It may be that the Lord will look on my affliction, and that the Lord will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:4">⚓</a>repay me with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 23:5; Neh. 13:2; Prov. 20:22">⚓</a>good for his cursing this day.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_13"><sup>13</sup>And as David and his men went along the road, Shimei went along the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, threw stones at him and kicked up dust. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_14"><sup>14</sup>Now the king and all the people who <i>were</i> with him became weary; so they refreshed themselves there.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Advice of Ahithophel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_15"> <sup>15</sup>Meanwhile <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 23:5; (Rom. 8:28; Heb. 12:10, 11)">⚓</a>Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem; and Ahithophel <i>was</i> with him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_16"><sup>16</sup>And so it was, when Hushai the Archite, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:12, 37">⚓</a>David’s friend, came to Absalom, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:37">⚓</a>Hushai said to Absalom, “<i>Long</i> live the king! <i>Long</i> live the king!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_17"> <sup>17</sup>So Absalom said to Hushai, “<i>Is</i> this your loyalty to your friend? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:34">⚓</a>Why did you not go with your friend?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_18"> <sup>18</sup>And Hushai said to Absalom, “No, but whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel choose, his I will be, and with him I will remain. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_19"><sup>19</sup>Furthermore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:25; (Prov. 17:17)">⚓</a>whom should I serve? <i>Should</i> <i>I</i> not <i>serve</i> in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so will I be in your presence.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then Absalom said to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:34">⚓</a>Ahithophel, “Give advice as to what we should do.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_21"> <sup>21</sup>And Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:12">⚓</a>concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:16; 20:3">⚓</a>are abhorred by your father. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 34:30; 1 Sam. 13:4">⚓</a>the hands of all who are with you will be strong.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_22"><sup>22</sup>So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the top of the house, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:7; Zech. 8:13">⚓</a>in the sight of all Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_16_23"> <sup>23</sup>Now the advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, <i>was</i> as if one had inquired at the oracle of God. So <i>was</i> all the advice of Ahithophel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:11, 12">⚓</a>both with David and with Absalom.<br/></span>
