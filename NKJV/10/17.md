<span class="verse 2sa_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Now let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue David tonight. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_2"><sup>2</sup>I will come upon him while he <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:12">⚓</a>weary and weak, and make him afraid. And all the people who <i>are</i> with him will flee, and I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 25:18; 2 Sam. 16:14">⚓</a>strike only the king. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_3"><sup>3</sup>Then I will bring back all the people to you. When all return except the man whom you seek, all the people will be at peace.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_4"><sup>4</sup>And the saying pleased Absalom and all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 13:7">⚓</a>elders of Israel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Advice of Hushai</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:3; 19:11">⚓</a>says too.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_6"><sup>6</sup>And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, “Ahithophel has spoken in this manner. Shall we do as he says? If not, speak up.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_7"> <sup>7</sup>So Hushai said to Absalom: “The advice that Ahithophel has given <i>is</i> not good at this time. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_8"><sup>8</sup>For,” said Hushai, “you know your father and his men, that they <i>are</i> mighty men, and they <i>are</i> enraged in their minds, like <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:32–34">⚓</a>a bear robbed of her cubs in the field; and your father <i>is</i> a man of war, and will not camp with the people. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_9"><sup>9</sup>Surely by now he is hidden in some pit, or in some <i>other</i> place. And it will be, when some of them are overthrown at the first, that whoever hears <i>it</i> will say, ‘There is a slaughter among the people who follow Absalom.’ </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_10"><sup>10</sup>And even he <i>who</i> <i>is</i> valiant, whose heart <i>is</i> like the heart of a lion, will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 13:8">⚓</a>melt completely. For all Israel knows that your father <i>is</i> a mighty man, and <i>those</i> who <i>are</i> with him <i>are</i> valiant men. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_11"><sup>11</sup>Therefore I advise that all Israel be fully gathered to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:11">⚓</a>from Dan to Beersheba, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:1; 2 Sam. 3:10">⚓</a>like the sand that <i>is</i> by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_12"><sup>12</sup>So we will come upon him in some place where he may be found, and we will fall on him as the dew falls on the ground. And of him and all the men who <i>are</i> with him there shall not be left so much as one. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_13"><sup>13</sup>Moreover, if he has withdrawn into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city; and we will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:17; Josh. 11:4; 1 Kin. 20:10">⚓</a>pull it into the river, until there is not one small stone found there.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_14"> <sup>14</sup>So Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Archite <i>is</i> better than the advice of Ahithophel.” For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mic. 1:6">⚓</a>the Lord had purposed to defeat the good advice of Ahithophel, to the intent that the Lord might bring disaster on Absalom.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Hushai Warns David to Escape</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:31, 34">⚓</a>Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, “Thus and so Ahithophel advised Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and so I have advised. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_16"><sup>16</sup>Now therefore, send quickly and tell David, saying, ‘Do not spend this night <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:35, 36">⚓</a>in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily cross over, lest the king and all the people who <i>are</i> with him be swallowed up.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:28">⚓</a>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:27, 36; 1 Kin. 1:42, 43">⚓</a>stayed at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:4–6">⚓</a>En Rogel, for they dared not be seen coming into the city; so a female servant would come and tell them, and they would go and tell King David. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_18"><sup>18</sup>Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom. But both of them went away quickly and came to a man’s house <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:7; 18:16">⚓</a>in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down into it. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:16; 16:5">⚓</a>Then the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground grain on it; and the thing was not known. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_20"><sup>20</sup>And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house, they said, “Where <i>are</i> Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”<br/> So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:4–6">⚓</a>the woman said to them, “They have gone over the water brook.”<br/> And when they had searched and could not find <i>them,</i> they returned to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_21"><sup>21</sup>Now it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well and went and told King David, and said to David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:19; (Lev. 19:11); Josh. 2:3–5">⚓</a>“Arise and cross over the water quickly. For thus has Ahithophel advised against you.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_22"><sup>22</sup>So David and all the people who <i>were</i> with him arose and crossed over the Jordan. By morning light not one of them was left who had not gone over the Jordan.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_23"> <sup>23</sup>Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:15, 16">⚓</a>his house, to his city. Then he put his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:12">⚓</a>household in order, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:1">⚓</a>hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his father’s tomb.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then David went to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:5">⚓</a>Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_25"><sup>25</sup>And Absalom made <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:2; Josh. 13:26; 2 Sam. 2:8; 19:32">⚓</a>Amasa captain of the army instead of Joab. This Amasa <i>was</i> the son of a man whose name <i>was</i> Jithra, an Israelite, who had gone in to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:13; 20:9–12; 1 Kin. 2:5, 32">⚓</a>Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_26"><sup>26</sup>So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_27"> <sup>27</sup>Now it happened, when David had come to Mahanaim, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 2:16">⚓</a>Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the people of Ammon, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 11:1; 2 Sam. 10:1; 12:29">⚓</a>Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 9:4">⚓</a>Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_28"><sup>28</sup>brought beds and basins, earthen vessels and wheat, barley and flour, parched <i>grain</i> and beans, lentils and parched <i>seeds,</i></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_17_29"><sup>29</sup>honey and curds, sheep and cheese of the herd, for David and the people who <i>were</i> with him to eat. For they said, “The people are hungry and weary and thirsty <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:31, 32; 1 Kin. 2:7">⚓</a>in the wilderness.”<br/></span>
