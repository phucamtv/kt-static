<div class="title"><h1>19</h1></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>And Joab was told, “Behold, the king is weeping and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:4">⚓</a>mourning for Absalom.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_2"><sup>2</sup>So the victory that day was <i>turned</i> into <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 14:2">⚓</a>mourning for all the people. For the people heard it said that day, “The king is grieved for his son.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_3"><sup>3</sup>And the people stole back <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 4:3">⚓</a>into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_4"><sup>4</sup>But the king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:24, 27; 19:32">⚓</a>covered his face, and the king cried out with a loud voice, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:30">⚓</a>“O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 18:33">⚓</a>Joab came into the house to the king, and said, “Today you have disgraced all your servants who today have saved your life, the lives of your sons and daughters, the lives of your wives and the lives of your concubines, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_6"><sup>6</sup>in that you love your enemies and hate your friends. For you have declared today that you regard neither princes nor servants; for today I perceive that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died today, then it would have pleased you well. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_7"><sup>7</sup>Now therefore, arise, go out and speak comfort to your servants. For I swear by the Lord, if you do not go out, not one will stay with you this night. And that will be worse for you than all the evil that has befallen you from your youth until now.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_8"><sup>8</sup>Then the king arose and sat in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 18:14">⚓</a>gate. And they told all the people, saying, “There is the king, sitting in the gate.” So all the people came before the king.<br/> For everyone of Israel had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:2; 18:24">⚓</a>fled to his tent.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David Returns to Jerusalem</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_9"> <sup>9</sup>Now all the people were in a dispute throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king saved us from the hand of our <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 18:17">⚓</a>enemies, he delivered us from the hand of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:1–14">⚓</a>Philistines, and now he has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:18">⚓</a>fled from the land because of Absalom. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_10"><sup>10</sup>But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. Now therefore, why do you say nothing about bringing back the king?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_11"> <sup>11</sup>So King David sent to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:14">⚓</a>Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house, since the words of all Israel have come to the king, to his <i>very</i> house? </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_12"><sup>12</sup>You <i>are</i> my brethren, you <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:24">⚓</a>my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?’ </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:1; 1 Chr. 11:1">⚓</a>And say to Amasa, ‘<i>Are</i> you not my bone and my flesh? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:25; 1 Chr. 2:17">⚓</a>God do so to me, and more also, if you are not commander of the army before me continually in place of Joab.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_14"><sup>14</sup>So he swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:17">⚓</a>just as <i>the</i> <i>heart</i> <i>of</i> one man, so that they sent <i>this</i> <i>word</i> to the king: “Return, you and all your servants!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then the king returned and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:1">⚓</a>Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to escort the king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:9; 1 Sam. 11:14, 15">⚓</a>across the Jordan. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_16"><sup>16</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:22">⚓</a>Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, who <i>was</i> from Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_17"><sup>17</sup><i>There</i> <i>were</i> a thousand men of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:5; 1 Kin. 2:8">⚓</a>Benjamin with him, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:19; 1 Kin. 12:21">⚓</a>Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over the Jordan before the king. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_18"><sup>18</sup>Then a ferryboat went across to carry over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David’s Mercy to Shimei</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_18"> Now Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king when he had crossed the Jordan. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_19"><sup>19</sup>Then he said to the king, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 9:2, 10; 16:1, 2">⚓</a>“Do not let my lord impute iniquity to me, or remember what <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 22:15">⚓</a>wrong your servant did on the day that my lord the king left Jerusalem, that the king should <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:5, 6">⚓</a>take <i>it</i> to heart. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_20"><sup>20</sup>For I, your servant, know that I have sinned. Therefore here I am, the first to come today of all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 13:33">⚓</a>the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_21"> <sup>21</sup>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, “Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:22; 1 Kin. 11:28">⚓</a>because he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 22:28)">⚓</a>cursed the Lord’s anointed?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_22"> <sup>22</sup>And David said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Sam. 26:9)">⚓</a>“What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should be adversaries to me today? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:39; 16:10">⚓</a>Shall any man be put to death today in Israel? For do I not know that today I <i>am</i> king over Israel?” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_23"><sup>23</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 11:13">⚓</a>the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king swore to him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David and Mephibosheth Meet</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_24"> <sup>24</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:8, 9, 37, 46">⚓</a>Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king. And he had not cared for his feet, nor trimmed his mustache, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he returned in peace. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_25"><sup>25</sup>So it was, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 9:6; 21:7">⚓</a>“Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_26"> <sup>26</sup>And he answered, “My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, ‘I will saddle a donkey for myself, that I may ride on it and go to the king,’ because your servant <i>is</i> lame. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_27"><sup>27</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:17">⚓</a>he has slandered your servant to my lord the king, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:3, 4">⚓</a>but my lord the king <i>is</i> like the angel of God. Therefore do <i>what</i> <i>is</i> good in your eyes. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_28"><sup>28</sup>For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 14:17, 20">⚓</a>Yet you set your servant among those who eat at your own table. Therefore what right have I still to cry out anymore to the king?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_29"> <sup>29</sup>So the king said to him, “Why do you speak anymore of your matters? I have said, ‘You and Ziba divide the land.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_30"> <sup>30</sup>Then Mephibosheth said to the king, “Rather, let him take it all, inasmuch as my lord the king has come back in peace to his own house.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David’s Kindness to Barzillai</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_31"> <sup>31</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 9:7–13">⚓</a>Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and went across the Jordan with the king, to escort him across the Jordan. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_32"><sup>32</sup>Now Barzillai was a very aged man, eighty years old. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:27–29; 1 Kin. 2:7">⚓</a>he had provided the king with supplies while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he <i>was</i> a very rich man. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_33"><sup>33</sup>And the king said to Barzillai, “Come across with me, and I will provide for you while you are with me in Jerusalem.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_34"> <sup>34</sup>But Barzillai said to the king, “How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_35"><sup>35</sup>I <i>am</i> today <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:27–29">⚓</a>eighty years old. Can I discern between the good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any longer the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be a further burden to my lord the king? </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_36"><sup>36</sup>Your servant will go a little way across the Jordan with the king. And why should the king repay me <i>with</i> such a reward? </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_37"><sup>37</sup>Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, near the grave of my father and mother. But here is your servant <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 90:10">⚓</a>Chimham; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what seems good to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_38"> <sup>38</sup>And the king answered, “Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what seems good to you. Now whatever you request of me, I will do for you.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_39"><sup>39</sup>Then all the people went over the Jordan. And when the king had crossed over, the king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:40; Jer. 41:17">⚓</a>kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his own place.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Quarrel About the King</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_40"> <sup>40</sup>Now the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him. And all the people of Judah escorted the king, and also half the people of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_41"><sup>41</sup>Just then all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, “Why have our brethren, the men of Judah, stolen you away and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:55; Ruth 1:14; 2 Sam. 14:33">⚓</a>brought the king, his household, and all David’s men with him across the Jordan?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_42"> <sup>42</sup>So all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:15">⚓</a>a close relative of ours. Why then are you angry over this matter? Have we ever eaten at the king’s <i>expense?</i> Or has he given us any gift?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_19_43"> <sup>43</sup>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:12">⚓</a>“We have ten shares in the king; therefore we also have more <i>right</i> to David than you. Why then do you despise us—were we not the first to advise bringing back our king?”<br/> Yet <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:30, 31">⚓</a>the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.<br/></span>
