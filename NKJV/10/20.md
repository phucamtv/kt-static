<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>The Rebellion of Sheba</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>And there happened to be there a rebel, whose name <i>was</i> Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjamite. And he blew a trumpet, and said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 8:1; 12:1">⚓</a>“We have no share in David,<br/>   Nor do we have inheritance in the son of Jesse;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:43; 1 Kin. 12:16">⚓</a>Every man to his tents, O Israel!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_2"> <sup>2</sup>So every man of Israel deserted David, <i>and</i> followed Sheba the son of Bichri. But the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:2; 2 Sam. 18:17; 2 Chr. 10:16">⚓</a>men of Judah, from the Jordan as far as Jerusalem, remained loyal to their king.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_3"> <sup>3</sup>Now David came to his house at Jerusalem. And the king took the ten women, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:14">⚓</a>his concubines whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in seclusion and supported them, but did not go in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_4"> <sup>4</sup>And the king said to Amasa, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:16; 16:21, 22">⚓</a>“Assemble the men of Judah for me within three days, and be present here yourself.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_5"><sup>5</sup>So Amasa went to assemble <i>the</i> <i>men</i> <i>of</i> Judah. But he delayed longer than the set time which David had appointed him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_6"><sup>6</sup>And David said to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:25; 19:13">⚓</a>Abishai, “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. Take <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 21:17">⚓</a>your lord’s servants and pursue him, lest he find for himself fortified cities, and escape us.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_7"><sup>7</sup>So Joab’s men, with the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 11:11; 1 Kin. 1:33">⚓</a>Cherethites, the Pelethites, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:18; 1 Kin. 1:38, 44">⚓</a>all the mighty men, went out after him. And they went out of Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_8"><sup>8</sup>When they <i>were</i> at the large stone which <i>is</i> in Gibeon, Amasa came before them. Now Joab was dressed in battle armor; on it was a belt <i>with</i> a sword fastened in its sheath at his hips; and as he was going forward, it fell out. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_9"><sup>9</sup>Then Joab said to Amasa, “<i>Are</i> you in health, my brother?” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:18">⚓</a>And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_10"><sup>10</sup>But Amasa did not notice the sword that <i>was</i> in Joab’s hand. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:49; Luke 22:47">⚓</a>he struck him with it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:27; 1 Kin. 2:5">⚓</a>in the stomach, and his entrails poured out on the ground; and he did not <i>strike</i> him again. Thus he died.<br/> Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_11"><sup>11</sup>Meanwhile one of Joab’s men stood near Amasa, and said, “Whoever favors Joab and whoever <i>is</i> for David—follow Joab!” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_12"><sup>12</sup>But Amasa wallowed in <i>his</i> blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he moved Amasa from the highway to the field and threw a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came upon him halted. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_13"><sup>13</sup>When he was removed from the highway, all the people went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_14"> <sup>14</sup>And he went through all the tribes of Israel to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:23">⚓</a>Abel and Beth Maachah and all the Berites. So they were gathered together and also went after <i>Sheba.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_15"><sup>15</sup>Then they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth Maachah; and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:20; 2 Kin. 15:29; 2 Chr. 16:4">⚓</a>cast up a siege mound against the city, and it stood by the rampart. And all the people who <i>were</i> with Joab battered the wall to throw it down.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then a wise woman cried out from the city, “Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, ‘Come nearby, that I may speak with you.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_17"><sup>17</sup>When he had come near to her, the woman said, “<i>Are</i> you Joab?”<br/> He answered, “I <i>am.</i>”<br/> Then she said to him, “Hear the words of your maidservant.”<br/> And he answered, “I am listening.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_18"> <sup>18</sup>So she spoke, saying, “They used to talk in former times, saying, ‘They shall surely seek <i>guidance</i> at Abel,’ and so they would end <i>disputes.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_19"><sup>19</sup>I <i>am</i> <i>among</i> <i>the</i> peaceable <i>and</i> faithful in Israel. You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:32; Ezek. 4:2">⚓</a>the inheritance of the Lord?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_20"> <sup>20</sup>And Joab answered and said, “Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy! </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_21"><sup>21</sup>That <i>is</i> not so. But a man from the mountains of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has raised his hand against the king, against David. Deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.”<br/> So the woman said to Joab, “Watch, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_20_22"><sup>22</sup>Then the woman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:19; 2 Sam. 14:16; 21:3">⚓</a>in her wisdom went to all the people. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw <i>it</i> out to Joab. Then he blew a trumpet, and they withdrew from the city, every man to his tent. So Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem.<br/></span>

<span class="verse 2sa_20_23"> <sup>23</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 20:16; (Eccl. 9:13–16)">⚓</a>Joab <i>was</i> over all the army of Israel; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i>was</i> over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; </span>
