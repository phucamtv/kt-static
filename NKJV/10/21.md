<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>David Avenges the Gibeonites</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now there was a famine in the days of David for three years, year after year; and David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:18">⚓</a>inquired of the Lord. And the Lord answered, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> because of Saul and <i>his</i> bloodthirsty house, because he killed the Gibeonites.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_2"><sup>2</sup>So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them. Now the Gibeonites <i>were</i> not of the children of Israel, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:21; 2 Sam. 5:19">⚓</a>of the remnant of the Amorites; the children of Israel had sworn protection to them, but Saul had sought to kill them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 9:3, 15–20">⚓</a>in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_3"> <sup>3</sup>Therefore David said to the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make atonement, that you may bless <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 34:11–16)">⚓</a>the inheritance of the Lord?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_4"> <sup>4</sup>And the Gibeonites said to him, “We will have no silver or gold from Saul or from his house, nor shall you kill any man in Israel for us.”<br/> So he said, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then they answered the king, “As for the man who consumed us and plotted against us, <i>that</i> we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the territories of Israel, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_6"><sup>6</sup>let seven men of his descendants be delivered <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 26:19; 2 Sam. 20:19">⚓</a>to us, and we will hang them before the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 25:4">⚓</a>in Gibeah of Saul, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:26">⚓</a><i>whom</i> the Lord chose.”<br/> And the king said, “I will give <i>them.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_7"> <sup>7</sup>But the king spared <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:24; (Hos. 13:11)">⚓</a>Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 4:4; 9:10">⚓</a>the Lord’s oath that <i>was</i> between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_8"><sup>8</sup>So the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:3; 20:12–17; 23:18; 2 Sam. 9:1–7">⚓</a>Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite; </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_9"><sup>9</sup>and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:7">⚓</a>before the Lord. So they fell, <i>all</i> seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first <i>days,</i> in the beginning of barley harvest.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:17">⚓</a>Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:7; 21:8">⚓</a>from the beginning of harvest until the late rains poured on them from heaven. And she did not allow the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_11"> <sup>11</sup>And David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_12"><sup>12</sup>Then David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 21:23">⚓</a>Jabesh Gilead who had stolen them from the street of Beth Shan, where the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:11–13">⚓</a>Philistines had hung them up, after the Philistines had struck down Saul in Gilboa. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_13"><sup>13</sup>So he brought up the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from there; and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_14"><sup>14</sup>They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:8">⚓</a>Zelah, in the tomb of Kish his father. So they performed all that the king commanded. And after that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:28">⚓</a>God heeded the prayer for the land.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Philistine Giants Destroyed</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_15"> <sup>15</sup>When the Philistines were at war again with Israel, David and his servants with him went down and fought against the Philistines; and David grew faint. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_16"><sup>16</sup>Then Ishbi-Benob, who <i>was</i> one of the sons of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:26; 2 Sam. 24:25">⚓</a>giant, the weight of whose bronze spear <i>was</i> three hundred <i>shekels,</i> who was bearing a new <i>sword,</i> thought he could kill David. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_17"><sup>17</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:22, 28; Josh. 15:14; 2 Sam. 21:18–22">⚓</a>Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 20:6–10">⚓</a>“You shall go out no more with us to battle, lest you quench the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 18:3">⚓</a>lamp of Israel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 22:29; 1 Kin. 11:36">⚓</a>Now it happened afterward that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 20:4–8">⚓</a>Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Saph, who <i>was</i> one of the sons of the giant. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_19"><sup>19</sup>Again there was war at Gob with the Philistines, where <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 11:29; 27:11">⚓</a>Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 23:24">⚓</a><i>the</i> <i>brother</i> <i>of</i> Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear <i>was</i> like a weaver’s beam.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_20"> <sup>20</sup>Yet again <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:4; 1 Chr. 20:5">⚓</a>there was war at Gath, where there was a man of <i>great</i> stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was born to the giant. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_21"><sup>21</sup>So when he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 20:6">⚓</a>defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_21_22"> <sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:10">⚓</a>These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.<br/></span>
