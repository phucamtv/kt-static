<div class="title"><h1>24</h1><h3>David’s Census of Israel and Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_1"> <sup>1</sup>Again <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 11:3, 6">⚓</a>the anger of the Lord was aroused against Israel, and He moved David against them to say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 21:1, 2">⚓</a>“Go, number Israel and Judah.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_2"> <sup>2</sup>So the king said to Joab the commander of the army who <i>was</i> with him, “Now go throughout all the tribes of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:2; 1 Chr. 27:23, 24">⚓</a>from Dan to Beersheba, and count the people, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 20:1; 2 Sam. 3:10">⚓</a>I may know the number of the people.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_3"> <sup>3</sup>And Joab said to the king, “Now may the Lord your God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 17:5)">⚓</a>add to the people a hundred times more than there are, and may the eyes of my lord the king see <i>it.</i> But why does my lord the king desire this thing?” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_4"><sup>4</sup>Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the army. Therefore Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_5"> <sup>5</sup>And they crossed over the Jordan and camped in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:11">⚓</a>Aroer, on the right side of the town which <i>is</i> in the midst of the ravine of Gad, and toward <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:36; Josh. 13:9, 16">⚓</a>Jazer. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_6"><sup>6</sup>Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi; they came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:1, 3">⚓</a>Dan Jaan and around to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:47; Judg. 18:29">⚓</a>Sidon; </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_7"><sup>7</sup>and they came to the stronghold of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:28; Judg. 18:28">⚓</a>Tyre and to all the cities of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:29">⚓</a>Hivites and the Canaanites. Then they went out to South Judah <i>as</i> <i>far</i> <i>as</i> Beersheba. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_8"><sup>8</sup>So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_9"><sup>9</sup>Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 11:3; Judg. 3:3">⚓</a>And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Judgment on David’s Sin</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_10"> <sup>10</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 21:5">⚓</a>David’s heart condemned him after he had numbered the people. So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:5">⚓</a>David said to the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 23:1">⚓</a>“I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, I pray, O Lord, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:13">⚓</a>done very foolishly.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now when David arose in the morning, the word of the Lord came to the prophet <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:13; (2 Chr. 16:9)">⚓</a>Gad, David’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 22:5">⚓</a>seer, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_12"><sup>12</sup>“Go and tell David, ‘Thus says the Lord: “I offer you three <i>things;</i> choose one of them for yourself, that I may do <i>it</i> to you.” ’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_13"><sup>13</sup>So Gad came to David and told him; and he said to him, “Shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:9; 1 Chr. 29:29">⚓</a>seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or shall you flee three months before your enemies, while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days’ plague in your land? Now consider and see what answer I should take back to Him who sent me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_14"> <sup>14</sup>And David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Please let us fall into the hand of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 14:21">⚓</a>for His mercies <i>are</i> great; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 51:1; 103:8, 13, 14; 119:156; 130:4, 7)">⚓</a>do not let me fall into the hand of man.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_15"> <sup>15</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 47:6; Zech. 1:15)">⚓</a>the Lord sent a plague upon Israel from the morning till the appointed time. From Dan to Beersheba seventy thousand men of the people died. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 21:14">⚓</a>And when the angel stretched out His hand over Jerusalem to destroy it, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:23; 2 Kin. 19:35; Acts 12:23">⚓</a>the Lord relented from the destruction, and said to the angel who was destroying the people, “It is enough; now restrain your hand.” And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel who was striking the people, and said, “Surely <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 6:6; 1 Sam. 15:11">⚓</a>I have sinned, and I have done wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, be against me and against my father’s house.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Altar on the Threshing Floor</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_18"> <sup>18</sup>And Gad came that day to David and said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:8; 1 Chr. 21:17; Ps. 74:1">⚓</a>“Go up, erect an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.” </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_19"><sup>19</sup>So David, according to the word of Gad, went up as the Lord commanded. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_20"><sup>20</sup>Now Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming toward him. So Araunah went out and bowed before the king with his face to the ground.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?”<br/> <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 21:18">⚓</a>And David said, “To buy the threshing floor from you, to build an altar to the Lord, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 23:8–16">⚓</a>the plague may be withdrawn from the people.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_22"> <sup>22</sup>Now Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up whatever <i>seems</i> good to him. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:48, 50">⚓</a>Look, <i>here</i> <i>are</i> oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing implements and the yokes of the oxen for wood. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_23"><sup>23</sup>All these, O king, Araunah has given to the king.”<br/> And Araunah said to the king, “May the Lord your God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 6:14; 1 Kin. 19:21">⚓</a>accept you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will surely buy <i>it</i> from you for a price; nor will I offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God with that which costs me nothing.” So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ezek. 20:40, 41)">⚓</a>David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. </span>
<span class="verse 2sa_24_25"><sup>25</sup>And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 21:24, 25">⚓</a>So the Lord heeded the prayers for the land, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 21:14">⚓</a>the plague was withdrawn from Israel.<br/></span>
