<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>Adonijah Presumes to Be King</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now King David was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23:1">⚓</a>old, advanced in years; and they put covers on him, but he could not get warm. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_2"><sup>2</sup>Therefore his servants said to him, “Let a young woman, a virgin, be sought for our lord the king, and let her stand before the king, and let her care for him; and let her lie in your bosom, that our lord the king may be warm.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_3"><sup>3</sup>So they sought for a lovely young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:17">⚓</a>Abishag the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:18; 1 Sam. 28:4">⚓</a>Shunammite, and brought her to the king. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_4"><sup>4</sup>The young woman <i>was</i> very lovely; and she cared for the king, and served him; but the king did not know her.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:4">⚓</a>Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, “I will be king”; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:1">⚓</a>he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_6"><sup>6</sup>(And his father had not rebuked him at any time by saying, “Why have you done so?” He <i>was</i> also very good-looking. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:3, 4; 1 Chr. 3:2">⚓</a><i>His</i> <i>mother</i> had borne him after Absalom.) </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_7"><sup>7</sup>Then he conferred with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 11:6">⚓</a>Joab the son of Zeruiah and with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 20:25">⚓</a>Abiathar the priest, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:22, 28">⚓</a>they followed and helped Adonijah. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_8"><sup>8</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:35">⚓</a>Zadok the priest, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:25; 2 Sam. 8:18">⚓</a>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:1">⚓</a>Nathan the prophet, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 4:18">⚓</a>Shimei, Rei, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 23:8">⚓</a>the mighty men who <i>belonged</i> to David were not with Adonijah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_9"> <sup>9</sup>And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fattened cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which <i>is</i> by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:7; 18:16; 2 Sam. 17:17">⚓</a>En Rogel; he also invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s servants. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_10"><sup>10</sup>But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:24">⚓</a>Solomon his brother.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_11"> <sup>11</sup>So Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, “Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:4">⚓</a>Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know <i>it?</i></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_12"><sup>12</sup>Come, please, let me now give you advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_13"><sup>13</sup>Go immediately to King David and say to him, ‘Did you not, my lord, O king, swear to your maidservant, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:30; 1 Chr. 22:9–13">⚓</a>“Assuredly your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne“? Why then has Adonijah become king?’ </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_14"><sup>14</sup>Then, while you are still talking there with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_15"> <sup>15</sup>So Bathsheba went into the chamber to the king. (Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was serving the king.) </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_16"><sup>16</sup>And Bathsheba bowed and did homage to the king. Then the king said, “What is your wish?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then she said to him, “My lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:13, 30">⚓</a>you swore by the Lord your God to your maidservant, <i>saying,</i> ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.’ </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_18"><sup>18</sup>So now, look! Adonijah has become king; and now, my lord the king, you do not know about <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:7–9, 25">⚓</a>He has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army; but Solomon your servant he has not invited. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_20"><sup>20</sup>And as for you, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel <i>are</i> on you, that you should tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_21"><sup>21</sup>Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:16; 2 Sam. 7:12; 1 Kin. 2:10">⚓</a>rests with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted as offenders.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_22"> <sup>22</sup>And just then, while she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_23"><sup>23</sup>So they told the king, saying, “Here is Nathan the prophet.” And when he came in before the king, he bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_24"><sup>24</sup>And Nathan said, “My lord, O king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne’? </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_25"><sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:9, 19">⚓</a>For he has gone down today, and has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons, and the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and look! They are eating and drinking before him; and they say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:24">⚓</a>‘<i>Long</i> live King Adonijah!’ </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_26"><sup>26</sup>But he has not invited me—me your servant—nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_27"><sup>27</sup>Has this thing been done by my lord the king, and you have not told your servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David Proclaims Solomon King</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then King David answered and said, “Call Bathsheba to me.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before the king. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_29"><sup>29</sup>And the king took an oath and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 4:9; 12:5">⚓</a>“<i>As</i> the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life from every distress, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:13, 17">⚓</a>just as I swore to you by the Lord God of Israel, saying, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’ so I certainly will do this day.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then Bathsheba bowed with <i>her</i> face to the earth, and paid homage to the king, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:3; Dan. 2:4; 3:9">⚓</a>“Let my lord King David live forever!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_32"> <sup>32</sup>And King David said, “Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” So they came before the king. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_33"><sup>33</sup>The king also said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 20:6">⚓</a>“Take with you the servants of your lord, and have Solomon my son ride on my own <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 6:8">⚓</a>mule, and take him down to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 32:30; 33:14">⚓</a>Gihon. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_34"><sup>34</sup>There let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:1; 16:3, 12; 2 Sam. 2:4; 5:3; 1 Kin. 19:16; 2 Kin. 9:3; 11:12; 1 Chr. 29:22">⚓</a>anoint him king over Israel; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:10; 2 Kin. 9:13; 11:14">⚓</a>blow the horn, and say, ‘<i>Long</i> live King Solomon!’ </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_35"><sup>35</sup>Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, and he shall be king in my place. For I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_36"> <sup>36</sup>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 28:6">⚓</a>“Amen! May the Lord God of my lord the king say so <i>too.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_37"><sup>37</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:5, 17; 1 Sam. 20:13">⚓</a>As the Lord has been with my lord the king, even so may He be with Solomon, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:47">⚓</a>make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_38"> <sup>38</sup>So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:18; 23:20–23">⚓</a>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 20:7; 1 Chr. 18:17">⚓</a>Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule, and took him to Gihon. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_39"><sup>39</sup>Then Zadok the priest took a horn of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:23, 25, 32; Ps. 89:20">⚓</a>oil from the tabernacle and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 29:22">⚓</a>anointed Solomon. And they blew the horn, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:24">⚓</a>and all the people said, <i>“Long</i> live King Solomon!” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_40"><sup>40</sup>And all the people went up after him; and the people played the flutes and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth <i>seemed</i> <i>to</i> split with their sound.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_41"> <sup>41</sup>Now Adonijah and all the guests who <i>were</i> with him heard <i>it</i> as they finished eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the horn, he said, “Why <i>is</i> the city in such a noisy uproar?” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_42"><sup>42</sup>While he was still speaking, there came <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:17, 20">⚓</a>Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest. And Adonijah said to him, “Come in, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 18:27">⚓</a>you <i>are</i> a prominent man, and bring good news.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_43"> <sup>43</sup>Then Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, “No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_44"><sup>44</sup>The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the king’s mule. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_45"><sup>45</sup>So Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This <i>is</i> the noise that you have heard. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_46"><sup>46</sup>Also Solomon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:12; 1 Chr. 29:23">⚓</a>sits on the throne of the kingdom. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_47"><sup>47</sup>And moreover the king’s servants have gone to bless our lord King David, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:37">⚓</a>‘May God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne.’ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 47:31">⚓</a>Then the king bowed himself on the bed. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_48"><sup>48</sup>Also the king said thus, ‘Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord God of Israel, who has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:6; (Ps. 132:11, 12)">⚓</a>given <i>one</i> to sit on my throne this day, while my eyes see <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:12">⚓</a><i>it!</i>’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_49"> <sup>49</sup>So all the guests who were with Adonijah were afraid, and arose, and each one went his way.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_50"> <sup>50</sup>Now Adonijah was afraid of Solomon; so he arose, and went and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 27:2; 30:10; 1 Kin. 2:28">⚓</a>took hold of the horns of the altar. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_51"><sup>51</sup>And it was told Solomon, saying, “Indeed Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon; for look, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_52"> <sup>52</sup>Then Solomon said, “If he proves himself a worthy man, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:45; 2 Sam. 14:11; Acts 27:34">⚓</a>not one hair of him shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_1_53"><sup>53</sup>So King Solomon sent them to bring him down from the altar. And he came and fell down before King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”<br/></span>
