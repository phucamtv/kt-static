<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Solomon Requests Wisdom</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:8; 9:24">⚓</a>Solomon made a treaty with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and married Pharaoh’s daughter; then he brought her <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:7">⚓</a>to the City of David until he had finished building his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:1">⚓</a>own house, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6">⚓</a>the house of the Lord, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:15, 19">⚓</a>the wall all around Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 12:2–5, 13, 14); 1 Kin. 11:7; 22:43">⚓</a>Meanwhile the people sacrificed at the high places, because there was no house built for the name of the Lord until those days. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_3"><sup>3</sup>And Solomon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 8:28)">⚓</a>loved the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Kin. 3:6, 14)">⚓</a>walking in the statutes of his father David, except that he sacrificed and burned incense at the high places.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:2; 2 Chr. 1:3">⚓</a>the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 16:39; 21:29">⚓</a>for that <i>was</i> the great high place: Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:2; 11:9; 2 Chr. 1:7">⚓</a>At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:6; Matt. 1:20; 2:13">⚓</a>in a dream by night; and God said, “Ask! What shall I give you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_6"> <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 1:8">⚓</a>And Solomon said: “You have shown great mercy to Your servant David my father, because he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:4; 9:4; 2 Kin. 20:3">⚓</a>walked before You in truth, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with You; You have continued this great kindness for him, and You <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:8–17; 1 Kin. 1:48">⚓</a>have given him a son to sit on his throne, as <i>it</i> <i>is</i> this day. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_7"><sup>7</sup>Now, O Lord my God, You have made Your servant king instead of my father David, but I <i>am</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 22:5; Jer. 1:6, 7">⚓</a>little child; I do not know <i>how</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:17; 2 Sam. 5:2">⚓</a>to go out or come in. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_8"><sup>8</sup>And Your servant <i>is</i> in the midst of Your people whom You <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 19:6; Deut. 7:6)">⚓</a>have chosen, a great people, too <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:6; 15:5; 22:17">⚓</a>numerous to be numbered or counted. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 1:10; (James 1:5)">⚓</a>Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 72:1, 2">⚓</a>to judge Your people, that I may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 14:17; Is. 7:15; (Heb. 5:14)">⚓</a>discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_10"> <sup>10</sup>The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_11"><sup>11</sup>Then God said to him: “Because you have asked this thing, and have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(James 4:3)">⚓</a>not asked long life for yourself, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 John 5:14, 15)">⚓</a>behold, I have done according to your words; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 4:29–31; 5:12; 10:24; Eccl. 1:16">⚓</a>see, I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has not been anyone like you before you, nor shall any like you arise after you. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_13"><sup>13</sup>And I have also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 6:33; Eph. 3:20)">⚓</a>given you what you have not asked: both <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 4:21, 24; 10:23; 1 Chr. 29:12">⚓</a>riches and honor, so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_14"><sup>14</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Kin. 6:12)">⚓</a>if you walk in My ways, to keep My statutes and My commandments, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:5">⚓</a>as your father David walked, then I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 91:16; Prov. 3:2">⚓</a>lengthen your days.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then Solomon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:7">⚓</a>awoke; and indeed it had been a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, offered up burnt offerings, offered peace offerings, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:20; 1 Kin. 8:65; Esth. 1:3; Dan. 5:1; Mark 6:21">⚓</a>made a feast for all his servants.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Solomon’s Wise Judgment</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_16"> <sup>16</sup>Now two women <i>who</i> <i>were</i> harlots came to the king, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:2">⚓</a>stood before him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_17"><sup>17</sup>And one woman said, “O my lord, this woman and I dwell in the same house; and I gave birth while she <i>was</i> in the house. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_18"><sup>18</sup>Then it happened, the third day after I had given birth, that this woman also gave birth. And we <i>were</i> together; no one <i>was</i> with us in the house, except the two of us in the house. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_19"><sup>19</sup>And this woman’s son died in the night, because she lay on him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_20"><sup>20</sup>So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from my side, while your maidservant slept, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_21"><sup>21</sup>And when I rose in the morning to nurse my son, there he was, dead. But when I had examined him in the morning, indeed, he was not my son whom I had borne.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then the other woman said, “No! But the living one <i>is</i> my son, and the dead one <i>is</i> your son.”<br/> And the first woman said, “No! But the dead one <i>is</i> your son, and the living one <i>is</i> my son.”<br/> Thus they spoke before the king.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_23"> <sup>23</sup>And the king said, “The one says, ‘This <i>is</i> my son, who lives, and your son <i>is</i> the dead one’; and the other says, ‘No! But your son <i>is</i> the dead one, and my son <i>is</i> the living one.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_24"><sup>24</sup>Then the king said, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought a sword before the king. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_25"><sup>25</sup>And the king said, “Divide the living child in two, and give half to one, and half to the other.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then the woman whose son <i>was</i> living spoke to the king, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 43:30; Is. 49:15; Jer. 31:20; Hos. 11:8">⚓</a>she yearned with compassion for her son; and she said, “O my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill him!”<br/> But the other said, “Let him be neither mine nor yours, <i>but</i> divide <i>him.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_27"> <sup>27</sup>So the king answered and said, “Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him; she <i>is</i> his mother.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_3_28"> <sup>28</sup>And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had rendered; and they feared the king, for they saw that the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:9, 11, 12; 2 Chr. 1:12; Dan. 1:17; (Col. 2:2, 3)">⚓</a>wisdom of God <i>was</i> in him to administer justice.<br/></span>
