<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Solomon Prepares to Build the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:10, 18; 2 Chr. 2:3">⚓</a>Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, because he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:11; 1 Chr. 14:1">⚓</a>for Hiram had always loved David. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_2"><sup>2</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 2:3">⚓</a>Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_3">  <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 28:2, 3">⚓</a>You know how my father David could not build a house for the name of the Lord his God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 22:8; 28:3">⚓</a>because of the wars which were fought against him on every side, until the Lord put <i>his</i> <i>foes</i> under the soles of his feet.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_4">   <sup>4</sup>But now the Lord my God has given me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 4:24; 1 Chr. 22:9">⚓</a>rest on every side; <i>there</i> <i>is</i> neither adversary nor evil occurrence.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_5">   <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 2:4">⚓</a>And behold, I propose to build a house for the name of the Lord my God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:12, 13; 1 Kin. 6:38; 1 Chr. 17:12; 22:10; 28:6; 2 Chr. 6:2">⚓</a>as the Lord spoke to my father David, saying, “Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build the house for My name.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_6">   <sup>6</sup>Now therefore, command that they cut down <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 2:8, 10">⚓</a>cedars for me from Lebanon; and my servants will be with your servants, and I will pay you wages for your servants according to whatever you say. For you know <i>there</i> <i>is</i> none among us who has skill to cut timber like the Sidonians.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_7"> <sup>7</sup>So it was, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly and said,<br/>  Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord this day, for He has given David a wise son over this great people!<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Hiram sent to Solomon, saying:<br/>  I have considered <i>the</i> <i>message</i> which you sent me, <i>and</i> I will do all you desire concerning the cedar and cypress logs.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_9">   <sup>9</sup>My servants shall bring <i>them</i> down <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 3:7">⚓</a>from Lebanon to the sea; I will float them in rafts by sea to the place you indicate to me, and will have them broken apart there; then you can take <i>them</i> away. And you shall fulfill my desire <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 27:17; Acts 12:20">⚓</a>by giving food for my household.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Hiram gave Solomon cedar and cypress logs <i>according</i> <i>to</i> all his desire. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 2:10">⚓</a>And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand kors of wheat <i>as</i> food for his household, and twenty kors of pressed oil. Thus Solomon gave to Hiram year by year.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_12"> <sup>12</sup>So the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:12">⚓</a>as He had promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty together.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then King Solomon raised up a labor force out of all Israel; and the labor force was thirty thousand men. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_14"><sup>14</sup>And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts: they were one month in Lebanon <i>and</i> two months at home; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:18">⚓</a>Adoniram <i>was</i> in charge of the labor force. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:20–22; 2 Chr. 2:17, 18">⚓</a>Solomon had seventy thousand who carried burdens, and eighty thousand who quarried <i>stone</i> in the mountains, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_16"><sup>16</sup>besides three thousand three hundred from the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:23">⚓</a>chiefs of Solomon’s deputies, who supervised the people who labored in the work. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_17"><sup>17</sup>And the king commanded them to quarry large stones, costly stones, <i>and</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:7; 1 Chr. 22:2">⚓</a>hewn stones, to lay the foundation of the temple. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_5_18"><sup>18</sup>So Solomon’s builders, Hiram’s builders, and the Gebalites quarried <i>them;</i> and they prepared timber and stones to build the temple.<br/></span>
