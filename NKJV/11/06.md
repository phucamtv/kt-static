<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Solomon Builds the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 3:1, 2">⚓</a>it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which <i>is</i> the second month, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:47">⚓</a>that he began to build the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_2"><sup>2</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 41:1">⚓</a>the house which King Solomon built for the Lord, its length <i>was</i> sixty cubits, its width twenty, and its height thirty cubits. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_3"><sup>3</sup>The vestibule in front of the sanctuary of the house <i>was</i> twenty cubits long across the width of the house, <i>and</i> the width of <i>the</i> <i>vestibule</i> <i>extended</i> ten cubits from the front of the house. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_4"><sup>4</sup>And he made for the house <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:16; 41:16">⚓</a>windows with beveled frames.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_5"> <sup>5</sup>Against the wall of the temple he built <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 41:6">⚓</a>chambers all around, <i>against</i> the walls of the temple, all around the sanctuary <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:16, 19–21, 31">⚓</a>and the inner sanctuary. Thus he made side chambers all around it. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_6"><sup>6</sup>The lowest chamber <i>was</i> five cubits wide, the middle <i>was</i> six cubits wide, and the third <i>was</i> seven cubits wide; for he made narrow ledges around the outside of the temple, so that <i>the</i> <i>support</i> <i>beams</i> would not be fastened into the walls of the temple. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_7"><sup>7</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:25; Deut. 27:5, 6">⚓</a>the temple, when it was being built, was built with stone finished at the quarry, so that no hammer or chisel <i>or</i> any iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_8"><sup>8</sup>The doorway for the middle story <i>was</i> on the right side of the temple. They went up by stairs to the middle <i>story,</i> and from the middle to the third.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:14, 38">⚓</a>So he built the temple and finished it, and he paneled the temple with beams and boards of cedar. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_10"><sup>10</sup>And he built side chambers against the entire temple, each five cubits high; they were attached to the temple with cedar beams.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying: </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_12"><sup>12</sup>“<i>Concerning</i> this temple which you are building, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:4; 9:4">⚓</a>if you walk in My statutes, execute My judgments, keep all My commandments, and walk in them, then I will perform My word with you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Sam. 7:13; 1 Chr. 22:10)">⚓</a>which I spoke to your father David. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_13"><sup>13</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:8; Lev. 26:11; (2 Cor. 6:16; Rev. 21:3)">⚓</a>I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 31:6)">⚓</a>forsake My people Israel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_14"> <sup>14</sup>So Solomon built the temple and finished it. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_15"><sup>15</sup>And he built the inside walls of the temple with cedar boards; from the floor of the temple to the ceiling he paneled the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the temple with planks of cypress. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_16"><sup>16</sup>Then he built the twenty-cubit room at the rear of the temple, from floor to ceiling, with cedar boards; he built <i>it</i> inside as the inner sanctuary, as the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 26:33; Lev. 16:2; 1 Kin. 8:6; 2 Chr. 3:8; Ezek. 45:3; Heb. 9:3">⚓</a>Most Holy <i>Place.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_17"><sup>17</sup>And in front of it the temple sanctuary was forty cubits <i>long.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_18"><sup>18</sup>The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with ornamental buds and open flowers. All <i>was</i> cedar; there was no stone <i>to</i> <i>be</i> seen.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_19"> <sup>19</sup>And he prepared the inner sanctuary inside the temple, to set the ark of the covenant of the Lord there. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_20"><sup>20</sup>The inner sanctuary <i>was</i> twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. He overlaid it with pure gold, and overlaid the altar of cedar. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_21"><sup>21</sup>So Solomon overlaid the inside of the temple with pure gold. He stretched gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_22"><sup>22</sup>The whole temple he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the temple; also he overlaid with gold <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:1, 3, 6">⚓</a>the entire altar that <i>was</i> by the inner sanctuary.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_23"> <sup>23</sup>Inside the inner sanctuary <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 37:7–9; 2 Chr. 3:10–12">⚓</a>he made two cherubim <i>of</i> olive wood, <i>each</i> ten cubits high. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_24"><sup>24</sup>One wing of the cherub <i>was</i> five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub five cubits: ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_25"><sup>25</sup>And the other cherub <i>was</i> ten cubits; both cherubim <i>were</i> of the same size and shape. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_26"><sup>26</sup>The height of one cherub <i>was</i> ten cubits, and so <i>was</i> the other cherub. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_27"><sup>27</sup>Then he set the cherubim inside the inner room; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:20; 37:9; 1 Kin. 8:7; 2 Chr. 5:8">⚓</a>they stretched out the wings of the cherubim so that the wing of the one touched <i>one</i> wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall. And their wings touched each other in the middle of the room. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_28"><sup>28</sup>Also he overlaid the cherubim with gold.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then he carved all the walls of the temple all around, both the inner and outer <i>sanctuaries,</i> with carved <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 36:8, 35">⚓</a>figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_30"><sup>30</sup>And the floor of the temple he overlaid with gold, both the inner and outer <i>sanctuaries.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_31"> <sup>31</sup>For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors <i>of</i> olive wood; the lintel <i>and</i> doorposts <i>were</i> one-fifth <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>wall.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_32"><sup>32</sup>The two doors <i>were</i> <i>of</i> olive wood; and he carved on them figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid <i>them</i> with gold; and he spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_33"><sup>33</sup>So for the door of the sanctuary he also made doorposts <i>of</i> olive wood, one-fourth <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>wall.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_34"><sup>34</sup>And the two doors <i>were</i> <i>of</i> cypress wood; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 41:23–25">⚓</a>two panels <i>comprised</i> one folding door, and two panels <i>comprised</i> the other folding door. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_35"><sup>35</sup>Then he carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers <i>on</i> <i>them,</i> and overlaid <i>them</i> with gold applied evenly on the carved work.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_36"> <sup>36</sup>And he built the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:12; Jer. 36:10">⚓</a>inner court with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_37"> <sup>37</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:1">⚓</a>In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid, in the month of Ziv. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_6_38"><sup>38</sup>And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its details and according to all its plans. So he was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:13; 1 Kin. 5:5; 6:1; 8:19">⚓</a>seven years in building it.<br/></span>
