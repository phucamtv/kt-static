<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>Solomon’s Other Buildings</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>But Solomon took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:1; 9:10; 2 Chr. 8:1">⚓</a>thirteen years to build his own house; so he finished all his house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_2"> <sup>2</sup>He also built the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 10:17, 21; 2 Chr. 9:16">⚓</a>House of the Forest of Lebanon; its length <i>was</i> one hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, with four rows of cedar pillars, and cedar beams on the pillars. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_3"><sup>3</sup>And <i>it</i> <i>was</i> paneled with cedar above the beams that <i>were</i> on forty-five pillars, fifteen <i>to</i> a row. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_4"><sup>4</sup><i>There</i> <i>were</i> windows <i>with</i> <i>beveled</i> <i>frames</i> <i>in</i> three rows, and window <i>was</i> opposite window <i>in</i> three tiers. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_5"><sup>5</sup>And all the doorways and doorposts <i>had</i> rectangular frames; and window <i>was</i> opposite window <i>in</i> three tiers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_6"> <sup>6</sup>He also made the Hall of Pillars: its length <i>was</i> fifty cubits, and its width thirty cubits; and in front of them <i>was</i> a portico with pillars, and a canopy <i>was</i> in front of them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then he made a hall for the throne, the Hall of Judgment, where he might judge; and <i>it</i> <i>was</i> paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_8"> <sup>8</sup>And the house where he dwelt <i>had</i> another court inside the hall, of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:1; 9:24; 11:1; 2 Chr. 8:11">⚓</a>whom he had taken <i>as</i> <i>wife.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_9"> <sup>9</sup>All these <i>were</i> <i>of</i> costly stones cut to size, trimmed with saws, inside and out, from the foundation to the eaves, and also on the outside to the great court. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_10"><sup>10</sup>The foundation <i>was</i> <i>of</i> costly stones, large stones, some ten cubits and some eight cubits. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_11"><sup>11</sup>And above <i>were</i> costly stones, hewn to size, and cedar wood. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_12"><sup>12</sup>The great court <i>was</i> enclosed with three rows of hewn stones and a row of cedar beams. So were the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:36">⚓</a>inner court of the house of the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 10:23; Acts 3:11">⚓</a>and the vestibule of the temple.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Hiram the Craftsman</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now King Solomon sent and brought Huram from Tyre. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 2:14">⚓</a>He <i>was</i> the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 4:16">⚓</a>his father <i>was</i> a man of Tyre, a bronze worker; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 31:3; 36:1">⚓</a>he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill in working with all kinds of bronze work. So he came to King Solomon and did all his work.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Bronze Pillars for the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_15"> <sup>15</sup>And he cast <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:17; 2 Chr. 3:15; 4:12; Jer. 52:21">⚓</a>two pillars of bronze, each one eighteen cubits high, and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of each. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_16"><sup>16</sup>Then he made two capitals <i>of</i> cast bronze, to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of one capital <i>was</i> five cubits, and the height of the other capital <i>was</i> five cubits. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_17"><sup>17</sup><i>He</i> <i>made</i> a lattice network, with wreaths of chainwork, for the capitals which <i>were</i> on top of the pillars: seven chains for one capital and seven for the other capital. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_18"><sup>18</sup>So he made the pillars, and two rows of pomegranates above the network all around to cover the capitals that <i>were</i> on top; and thus he did for the other capital.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_19"> <sup>19</sup>The capitals which <i>were</i> on top of the pillars in the hall <i>were</i> in the shape of lilies, four cubits. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_20"><sup>20</sup>The capitals on the two pillars also <i>had</i> <i>pomegranates</i> above, by the convex surface which <i>was</i> next to the network; and there <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 3:16; 4:13; Jer. 52:23">⚓</a>two hundred such pomegranates in rows on each of the capitals all around.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 3:17">⚓</a>Then he set up the pillars by the vestibule of the temple; he set up the pillar on the right and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the left and called its name Boaz. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_22"><sup>22</sup>The tops of the pillars were in the shape of lilies. So the work of the pillars was finished.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Sea and the Oxen</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_23"> <sup>23</sup>And he made <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:13; 2 Chr. 4:2; Jer. 52:17">⚓</a>the Sea of cast bronze, ten cubits from one brim to the other; <i>it</i> <i>was</i> completely round. Its height <i>was</i> five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_24"> <sup>24</sup>Below its brim <i>were</i> ornamental buds encircling it all around, ten to a cubit, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 4:3">⚓</a>all the way around the Sea. The ornamental buds <i>were</i> cast in two rows when it was cast. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_25"><sup>25</sup>It stood on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 4:4, 5; Jer. 52:20">⚓</a>twelve oxen: three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; the Sea <i>was</i> <i>set</i> upon them, and all their back parts <i>pointed</i> inward. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_26"><sup>26</sup>It <i>was</i> a handbreadth thick; and its brim was shaped like the brim of a cup, <i>like</i> a lily blossom. It contained two thousand baths.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Carts and the Lavers</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_27"> <sup>27</sup>He also made ten carts of bronze; four cubits <i>was</i> the length of each cart, four cubits its width, and three cubits its height. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_28"><sup>28</sup>And this <i>was</i> the design of the carts: They had panels, and the panels <i>were</i> between frames; </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_29"><sup>29</sup>on the panels that <i>were</i> between the frames <i>were</i> lions, oxen, and cherubim. And on the frames <i>was</i> a pedestal on top. Below the lions and oxen <i>were</i> wreaths of plaited work. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_30"><sup>30</sup>Every cart had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and its four feet had supports. Under the laver <i>were</i> supports of cast <i>bronze</i> beside each wreath. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_31"><sup>31</sup>Its opening inside the crown at the top <i>was</i> one cubit in diameter; and the opening <i>was</i> round, shaped <i>like</i> a pedestal, one and a half cubits in outside diameter; and also on the opening <i>were</i> engravings, but the panels were square, not round. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_32"><sup>32</sup>Under the panels <i>were</i> the four wheels, and the axles of the wheels <i>were</i> <i>joined</i> to the cart. The height of a wheel <i>was</i> one and a half cubits. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_33"><sup>33</sup>The workmanship of the wheels <i>was</i> like the workmanship of a chariot wheel; their axle pins, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs <i>were</i> all of cast <i>bronze.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_34"><sup>34</sup>And <i>there</i> <i>were</i> four supports at the four corners of each cart; its supports <i>were</i> part of the cart itself. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_35"><sup>35</sup>On the top of the cart, at the height of half a cubit, <i>it</i> <i>was</i> perfectly round. And on the top of the cart, its flanges and its panels <i>were</i> of the same casting. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_36"><sup>36</sup>On the plates of its flanges and on its panels he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, wherever there was a clear space on each, with wreaths all around. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_37"><sup>37</sup>Thus he made the ten carts. All of them were of the same mold, one measure, <i>and</i> one shape.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_38"> <sup>38</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:18; 2 Chr. 4:6">⚓</a>he made ten lavers of bronze; each laver contained forty baths, <i>and</i> each laver <i>was</i> four cubits. On each of the ten carts <i>was</i> a laver. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_39"><sup>39</sup>And he put five carts on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. He set the Sea on the right side of the house, toward the southeast.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Furnishings of the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_40"> <sup>40</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 4:11—5:1">⚓</a>Huram made the lavers and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram finished doing all the work that he was to do for King Solomon <i>for</i> the house of the Lord: </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_41"><sup>41</sup>the two pillars, the <i>two</i> bowl-shaped capitals that <i>were</i> on top of the two pillars; the two <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:17, 18">⚓</a>networks covering the two bowl-shaped capitals which <i>were</i> on top of the pillars; </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_42"><sup>42</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:20">⚓</a>four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that <i>were</i> on top of the pillars); </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_43"><sup>43</sup>the ten carts, and ten lavers on the carts; </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_44"><sup>44</sup>one Sea, and twelve oxen under the Sea; </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_45"><sup>45</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 27:3; 2 Chr. 4:16">⚓</a>the pots, the shovels, and the bowls.<br/> All these articles which Huram made for King Solomon <i>for</i> the house of the Lord<i>were</i> <i>of</i> burnished bronze. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_46"><sup>46</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 4:17">⚓</a>In the plain of Jordan the king had them cast in clay molds, between <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:17; Josh. 13:27">⚓</a>Succoth and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:16">⚓</a>Zaretan. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_47"><sup>47</sup>And Solomon did not weigh all the articles, because <i>there</i> <i>were</i> so many; the weight of the bronze was not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 22:3, 14">⚓</a>determined.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_48"> <sup>48</sup>Thus Solomon had all the furnishings made for the house of the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 37:25, 26; 2 Chr. 4:8">⚓</a>the altar of gold, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 37:10, 11">⚓</a>the table of gold on which <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 24:5–8">⚓</a>the showbread; </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_49"><sup>49</sup>the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right <i>side</i> and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary, with the flowers and the lamps and the wick-trimmers of gold; </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_50"><sup>50</sup>the basins, the trimmers, the bowls, the ladles, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, <i>both</i> for the doors of the inner room (the Most Holy <i>Place</i>) <i>and</i> for the doors of the main hall of the temple.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_7_51"> <sup>51</sup>So all the work that King Solomon had done for the house of the Lord was finished; and Solomon brought in the things <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:11; 1 Chr. 18:11; 2 Chr. 5:1">⚓</a>which his father David had dedicated: the silver and the gold and the furnishings. He put them in the treasuries of the house of the Lord.<br/></span>
