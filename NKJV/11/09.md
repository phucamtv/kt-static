<span class="verse 1vua_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 7:11">⚓</a>it came to pass, when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:1">⚓</a>and the king’s house, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 8:6">⚓</a>all Solomon’s desire which he wanted to do, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_2"><sup>2</sup>that the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:5; 11:9; 2 Chr. 1:7">⚓</a>as He had appeared to him at Gibeon. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_3"><sup>3</sup>And the Lord said to him: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:5; Ps. 10:17">⚓</a>“I have heard your prayer and your supplication that you have made before Me; I have consecrated this house which you have built <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:29">⚓</a>to put My name there forever, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 11:12">⚓</a>My eyes and My heart will be there perpetually. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_4"><sup>4</sup>Now if you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:1">⚓</a>walk before Me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:4, 6; 15:5">⚓</a>as your father David walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, <i>and</i> if you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:61">⚓</a>keep My statutes and My judgments, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_5"><sup>5</sup>then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:12, 16; 1 Kin. 2:4; 6:12; 8:25; 1 Chr. 22:10; Matt. 1:6; 25:31">⚓</a>as I promised David your father, saying, ‘You shall not fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’ </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:14–16; 2 Chr. 7:19, 20; Ps. 89:30">⚓</a><i>But</i> if you or your sons at all turn from following Me, and do not keep My commandments <i>and</i> My statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 18:24–29); Deut. 4:26; 2 Kin. 17:23; 25:21">⚓</a>then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house which I have consecrated <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 7:4–14)">⚓</a>for My name I will cast out of My sight. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:37; Ps. 44:14; Jer. 24:9">⚓</a>Israel will be a proverb and a byword among all peoples. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_8"><sup>8</sup>And <i>as</i> <i>for</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 7:21">⚓</a>this house, <i>which</i> is exalted, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and will hiss, and say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 29:24–26); Jer. 22:8, 9">⚓</a>‘Why has the Lord done thus to this land and to this house?’ </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_9"><sup>9</sup>Then they will answer, ‘Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore the Lord has brought all this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 29:25–28)">⚓</a>calamity on them.’ ”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Solomon and Hiram Exchange Gifts</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:37, 38; 7:1; 2 Chr. 8:1">⚓</a>it happened at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the Lord and the king’s house </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:1">⚓</a>(Hiram the king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress and gold, as much as he desired), <i>that</i> King Solomon then gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_12"><sup>12</sup>Then Hiram went from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, but they did not please him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_13"><sup>13</sup>So he said, “What <i>kind</i> <i>of</i> cities <i>are</i> these which you have given me, my brother?” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:27">⚓</a>And he called them the land of Cabul, as they are to this day. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_14"><sup>14</sup>Then Hiram sent the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Solomon’s Additional Achievements</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_15"> <sup>15</sup>And this <i>is</i> the reason for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:13">⚓</a>the labor force which King Solomon raised: to build the house of the Lord, his own house, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:9; 1 Kin. 9:24">⚓</a>Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 11:1; 19:36">⚓</a>Hazor, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 17:11">⚓</a>Megiddo, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:10">⚓</a>Gezer. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_16"><sup>16</sup>(Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burned it with fire, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 16:10; Judg. 1:29">⚓</a>had killed the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and had given it <i>as</i> a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.) </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_17"><sup>17</sup>And Solomon built Gezer, Lower <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:10; 16:3; 21:22; 2 Chr. 8:5">⚓</a>Beth Horon, </span>

<span class="verse 1vua_9_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 8:7">⚓</a>All the people <i>who</i> <i>were</i> left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who <i>were</i> not of the children of Israel— </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_21"><sup>21</sup>that is, their descendants <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:21–36; 3:1">⚓</a>who were left in the land after them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:63; 17:12, 13">⚓</a>whom the children of Israel had not been able to destroy completely—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 1:28, 35">⚓</a>from these Solomon raised <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 2:55, 58; Neh. 7:57">⚓</a>forced labor, as it is to this day. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_22"><sup>22</sup>But of the children of Israel Solomon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 25:39)">⚓</a>made no forced laborers, because they <i>were</i> men of war and his servants: his officers, his captains, commanders of his chariots, and his cavalry.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_23"> <sup>23</sup>Others <i>were</i> chiefs of the officials who <i>were</i> over Solomon’s work: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 8:10">⚓</a>five hundred and fifty, who ruled over the people who did the work.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_24"> <sup>24</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:1">⚓</a>Pharaoh’s daughter came up from the City of David to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:8">⚓</a>her house which <i>Solomon</i> had built for her. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:9; 1 Kin. 11:27; 2 Chr. 32:5">⚓</a>Then he built the Millo.<br/></span>

<span class="verse 1vua_9_26"> <sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 8:17, 18">⚓</a>King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:35; Deut. 2:8; 1 Kin. 22:48">⚓</a>Ezion Geber, which <i>is</i> near Elath on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_9_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:6, 9; 10:11">⚓</a>Then Hiram sent his servants with the fleet, seamen who knew the sea, to work with the servants of Solomon. </span>
