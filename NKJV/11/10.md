<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>The Queen of Sheba’s Praise of Solomon</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now when the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 9:1; Matt. 12:42; Luke 11:31">⚓</a>queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord, she came <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 14:12; Ps. 49:4; Prov. 1:6">⚓</a>to test him with hard questions. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_2"><sup>2</sup>She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels that bore spices, very much gold, and precious stones; and when she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_3"><sup>3</sup>So Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing so difficult for the king that he could not explain <i>it</i> to her. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_4"><sup>4</sup>And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_5"><sup>5</sup>the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the service of his waiters and their apparel, his cupbearers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 26:16; 2 Chr. 9:4">⚓</a>and his entryway by which he went up to the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_6"><sup>6</sup>Then she said to the king: “It was a true report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_7"><sup>7</sup>However I did not believe the words until I came and saw with my own eyes; and indeed the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame of which I heard. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 8:34">⚓</a>Happy <i>are</i> your men and happy <i>are</i> these your servants, who stand continually before you <i>and</i> hear your wisdom! </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:7">⚓</a>Blessed be the Lord your God, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 22:20">⚓</a>delighted in you, setting you on the throne of Israel! Because the Lord has loved Israel forever, therefore He made you king, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:15; Ps. 72:2; (Prov. 8:15)">⚓</a>to do justice and righteousness.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then she <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 72:10, 15">⚓</a>gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great quantity, and precious stones. There never again came such abundance of spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:27, 28; Job 22:24">⚓</a>Also, the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought great quantities of almug wood and precious stones from Ophir. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 9:11">⚓</a>And the king made steps of the almug wood for the house of the Lord and for the king’s house, also harps and stringed instruments for singers. There never again came such <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 9:10">⚓</a>almug wood, nor has the like been seen to this day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, besides what Solomon had given her according to the royal generosity. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Solomon’s Great Wealth</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_14"> <sup>14</sup>The weight of gold that came to Solomon yearly was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_15"><sup>15</sup>besides <i>that</i> from the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 1:16">⚓</a>traveling merchants, from the income of traders, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 9:24; Ps. 72:10">⚓</a>from all the kings of Arabia, and from the governors of the country.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_16"> <sup>16</sup>And King Solomon made two hundred large shields <i>of</i> hammered gold; six hundred <i>shekels</i> of gold went into each shield. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_17"><sup>17</sup>He also <i>made</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:26">⚓</a>three hundred shields <i>of</i> hammered gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:2">⚓</a>House of the Forest of Lebanon.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 10:22; 2 Chr. 9:17; Ps. 45:8">⚓</a>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_19"><sup>19</sup>The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne <i>was</i> round at the back; <i>there</i> <i>were</i> armrests on either side of the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the armrests. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_20"><sup>20</sup>Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like <i>this</i> had been made for any <i>other</i> kingdom.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 9:20">⚓</a>All King Solomon’s drinking vessels <i>were</i> gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon <i>were</i> pure gold. Not <i>one</i> <i>was</i> silver, for this was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_22"><sup>22</sup>For the king had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 10:4; 2 Chr. 20:36">⚓</a>merchant ships at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the merchant <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:26–28; 22:48; Ps. 72:10">⚓</a>ships came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_23"><sup>23</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:12, 13; 4:30; 2 Chr. 1:12">⚓</a>King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_24"> <sup>24</sup>Now all the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_25"><sup>25</sup>Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, armor, spices, horses, and mules, at a set rate year by year.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_26"> <sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 4:26; 2 Chr. 1:14; 9:25">⚓</a>And Solomon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 17:16); 1 Kin. 9:19">⚓</a>gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 17:17); 2 Chr. 1:15–17">⚓</a>The king made silver <i>as</i> <i>common</i> in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which <i>are</i> in the lowland.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_28"> <sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 17:16); 2 Chr. 1:16; 9:28">⚓</a>Also Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh; the king’s merchants bought them in Keveh at the <i>current</i> price. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_10_29"><sup>29</sup>Now a chariot that was imported from Egypt cost six hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver, and a horse one hundred and fifty; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 1:4; 2 Kin. 7:6, 7">⚓</a>and thus, through their agents, they exported <i>them</i> to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.<br/></span>
