<div class="title"><h1>14</h1><h3>Judgment on the House of Jeroboam</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_1"> <sup>1</sup>At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_2"><sup>2</sup>And Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please arise, and disguise yourself, that they may not recognize you as the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Indeed, Ahijah the prophet <i>is</i> there, who told me that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:29–31">⚓</a><i>I</i> <i>would</i> <i>be</i> king over this people. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:7, 8; 1 Kin. 13:7; 2 Kin. 4:42">⚓</a>Also take with you ten loaves, <i>some</i> cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him; he will tell you what will become of the child.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_4"><sup>4</sup>And Jeroboam’s wife did so; she arose <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:29">⚓</a>and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were glazed by reason of his age.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now the Lord had said to Ahijah, “Here is the wife of Jeroboam, coming to ask you something about her son, for he <i>is</i> sick. Thus and thus you shall say to her; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will pretend <i>to</i> <i>be</i> another <i>woman.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_6"> <sup>6</sup>And so it was, when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps as she came through the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend <i>to</i> <i>be</i> another <i>person?</i> For I <i>have</i> <i>been</i> sent to you <i>with</i> bad <i>news.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_7"><sup>7</sup>Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says the Lord God of Israel: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:7, 8; 1 Kin. 16:2">⚓</a>“Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you ruler over My people Israel, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_8"><sup>8</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:31">⚓</a>tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to you; and <i>yet</i> you have not been as My servant David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:33, 38; 15:5">⚓</a>who kept My commandments and who followed Me with all his heart, to do only <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in My eyes; </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_9"><sup>9</sup>but you have done more evil than all who were before you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:28; 2 Chr. 11:15">⚓</a>for you have gone and made for yourself other gods and molded images to provoke Me to anger, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:6; Neh. 9:26; Ps. 50:17">⚓</a>have cast Me behind your back— </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_10"><sup>10</sup>therefore behold! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:29">⚓</a>I will bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:21; 2 Kin. 9:8">⚓</a>will cut off from Jeroboam every male in Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:36; 2 Kin. 14:26">⚓</a>bond and free; I will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as one takes away refuse until it is all gone. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_11"><sup>11</sup>The dogs shall eat <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:4; 21:24">⚓</a>whoever belongs to Jeroboam and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field; for the Lord has spoken!” ’ </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_12"><sup>12</sup>Arise therefore, go to your own house. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:17">⚓</a>When your feet enter the city, the child shall die. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_13"><sup>13</sup>And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he is the only one of Jeroboam who shall come to the grave, because in him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 12:12; 19:3">⚓</a>there is found something good toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:27–29">⚓</a>“Moreover the Lord will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam; this is the day. What? Even now! </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_15"><sup>15</sup>For the Lord will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water. He will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:28; 2 Kin. 17:6; Ps. 52:5">⚓</a>uproot Israel from this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Josh. 23:15, 16)">⚓</a>good land which He gave to their fathers, and will scatter them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:29">⚓</a>beyond the River, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 34:13, 14; Deut. 12:3)">⚓</a>because they have made their wooden images, provoking the Lord to anger. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_16"><sup>16</sup>And He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:30; 13:34; 15:30, 34; 16:2">⚓</a>who sinned and who made Israel sin.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed, and came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:21, 33; 16:6, 8, 15, 23; Song 6:4">⚓</a>Tirzah. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:12">⚓</a>When she came to the threshold of the house, the child died. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_18"><sup>18</sup>And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:13">⚓</a>according to the word of the Lord which He spoke through His servant Ahijah the prophet.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Jeroboam</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_19"> <sup>19</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:30; 2 Chr. 13:2–20">⚓</a>made war and how he reigned, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_20"><sup>20</sup>The period that Jeroboam reigned <i>was</i> twenty-two years. So he rested with his fathers. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:25">⚓</a>Then Nadab his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Rehoboam Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_21"> <sup>21</sup>And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 12:13">⚓</a>Rehoboam <i>was</i> forty-one years old when he became king. He reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:32, 36">⚓</a>which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:31">⚓</a>His mother’s name <i>was</i> Naamah, an Ammonitess. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 12:1, 14">⚓</a>Now Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:21; Ps. 78:58; 1 Cor. 10:22">⚓</a>provoked Him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more than all that their fathers had done. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_23"><sup>23</sup>For they also built for themselves <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:2; Ezek. 16:24, 25">⚓</a>high places, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 16:22)">⚓</a><i>sacred</i> pillars, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Kin. 17:9, 10)">⚓</a>wooden images on every high hill and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 57:5; Jer. 2:20">⚓</a>under every green tree. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:5; Deut. 23:17; 1 Kin. 15:12; 22:46; 2 Kin. 23:7">⚓</a>And there were also perverted persons in the land. They did according to all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:18">⚓</a>abominations of the nations which the Lord had cast out before the children of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 9:4, 5)">⚓</a>Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_25"> <sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:40; 2 Chr. 12:2">⚓</a>It happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam <i>that</i> Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_26"><sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:18; 2 Chr. 12:9–11">⚓</a>And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king’s house; he took away everything. He also took away all the gold shields <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 10:17">⚓</a>which Solomon had made. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_27"><sup>27</sup>Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed <i>them</i> to the hands of the captains of the guard, who guarded the doorway of the king’s house. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_28"><sup>28</sup>And whenever the king entered the house of the Lord, the guards carried them, then brought them back into the guardroom.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_29"> <sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 12:15, 16">⚓</a>Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_30"><sup>30</sup>And there was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:21–24; 15:6">⚓</a>war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all <i>their</i> days. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_14_31"><sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 12:16">⚓</a>So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:21">⚓</a>His mother’s name <i>was</i> Naamah, an Ammonitess. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 12:16">⚓</a>Abijam his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
