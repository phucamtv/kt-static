<span class="verse 1vua_15_1"> <sup>1</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 13:1">⚓</a>In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam became king over Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_2"><sup>2</sup>He reigned three years in Jerusalem. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 11:20–22">⚓</a>His mother’s name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 13:2">⚓</a>Maachah the granddaughter of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 11:21">⚓</a>Abishalom. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_3"><sup>3</sup>And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:4; Ps. 119:80">⚓</a>his heart was not loyal to the Lord his God, as was the heart of his father David. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_4"><sup>4</sup>Nevertheless <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 21:17; 1 Kin. 11:32, 36; 2 Chr. 21:7">⚓</a>for David’s sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, by setting up his son after him and by establishing Jerusalem; </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_5"><sup>5</sup>because David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:4; 14:8; Luke 1:6">⚓</a>did <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in the eyes of the Lord, and had not turned aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 11:3, 15–17; 12:9, 10">⚓</a>except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:30; 2 Chr. 12:15—13:20">⚓</a>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 13:2–22">⚓</a>Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_8"> <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 14:1">⚓</a>So Abijam rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then Asa his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Asa Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_9"> <sup>9</sup>In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa became king over Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_10"><sup>10</sup>And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His grandmother’s name <i>was</i> Maachah the granddaughter of Abishalom. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 14:2">⚓</a>Asa did <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in the eyes of the Lord, as <i>did</i> his father David. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 23:17; 1 Kin. 14:24; 22:46">⚓</a>And he banished the perverted persons from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_13"><sup>13</sup>Also he removed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 15:16–18">⚓</a>Maachah his grandmother from <i>being</i> queen mother, because she had made an obscene image of Asherah. And Asa cut down her obscene image and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:20">⚓</a>burned <i>it</i> by the Brook Kidron. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:2; 22:43; 2 Kin. 12:3; 2 Chr. 15:17, 18">⚓</a>But the high places were not removed. Nevertheless Asa’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Sam. 16:7); 1 Kin. 8:61; 15:3">⚓</a>heart was loyal to the Lord all his days. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_15"><sup>15</sup>He also brought into the house of the Lord the things which his father <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:51">⚓</a>had dedicated, and the things which he himself had dedicated: silver and gold and utensils.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_16"> <sup>16</sup>Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_17"><sup>17</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 16:1–6">⚓</a>Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:25; 1 Kin. 15:21, 22">⚓</a>Ramah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:26–29">⚓</a>that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_18"><sup>18</sup>Then Asa took all the silver and gold <i>that</i> <i>was</i> left in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and the treasuries of the king’s house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants. And King Asa sent them to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:17, 18; 2 Chr. 16:2">⚓</a>Ben-Hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:15; 1 Kin. 11:23, 24">⚓</a>Damascus, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_19"><sup>19</sup>“<i>Let</i> <i>there</i> <i>be</i> a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. See, I have sent you a present of silver and gold. Come and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_20"> <sup>20</sup>So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 20:1">⚓</a>sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel. He attacked <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:29">⚓</a>Ijon, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 18:29; 1 Kin. 12:29">⚓</a>Dan, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 20:14, 15">⚓</a>Abel Beth Maachah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_21"><sup>21</sup>Now it happened, when Baasha heard <i>it,</i> that he stopped building Ramah, and remained in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:17; 16:15–18">⚓</a>Tirzah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_22"> <sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 16:6">⚓</a>Then King Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none <i>was</i> exempted. And they took away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them King Asa built <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 21:17">⚓</a>Geba of Benjamin, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:26">⚓</a>Mizpah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_23"> <sup>23</sup>The rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, all that he did, and the cities which he built, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 16:11–14">⚓</a>in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_24"><sup>24</sup>So Asa rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David his father. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 17:1">⚓</a>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:41–44; Matt. 1:8">⚓</a>Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Nadab Reigns in Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:20">⚓</a>Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_26"><sup>26</sup>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father, and in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:28–33; 14:16">⚓</a>his sin by which he had made Israel sin.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_27"> <sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:14">⚓</a>Then Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him. And Baasha killed him at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:44; 21:23; 1 Kin. 16:15">⚓</a>Gibbethon, which <i>belonged</i> to the Philistines, while Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_28"><sup>28</sup>Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_29"><sup>29</sup>And it was so, when he became king, <i>that</i> he killed all the house of Jeroboam. He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:10–14">⚓</a>the word of the Lord which He had spoken by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:9, 16">⚓</a>because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he had sinned and by which he had made Israel sin, because of his provocation with which he had provoked the Lord God of Israel to anger.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_31"> <sup>31</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_32"><sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:16">⚓</a>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Baasha Reigns in Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_33"> <sup>33</sup>In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel in Tirzah, and <i>reigned</i> twenty-four years. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_15_34"><sup>34</sup>He did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 13:33; 14:16">⚓</a>the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin.<br/></span>
