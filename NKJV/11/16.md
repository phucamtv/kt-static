<span class="verse 1vua_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:7; 2 Chr. 19:2; 20:34">⚓</a>Jehu the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 16:7–10">⚓</a>Hanani, against <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:27">⚓</a>Baasha, saying: </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:8; 1 Kin. 14:7">⚓</a>“Inasmuch as I lifted you out of the dust and made you ruler over My people Israel, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:25–33; 15:34">⚓</a>you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have made My people Israel sin, to provoke Me to anger with their sins, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_3"><sup>3</sup>surely I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:11; 21:21">⚓</a>take away the posterity of Baasha and the posterity of his house, and I will make your house like <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:10; 15:29">⚓</a>the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_4"><sup>4</sup>The dogs shall eat <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:11; 21:24">⚓</a>whoever belongs to Baasha and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the fields.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, what he did, and his might, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 16:11">⚓</a><i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_6"><sup>6</sup>So Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:17; 15:21">⚓</a>Tirzah. Then Elah his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_7"> <sup>7</sup>And also the word of the Lord came by the prophet <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:1">⚓</a>Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the Lord in provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:27, 29">⚓</a>he killed them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Elah Reigns in Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_8"> <sup>8</sup>In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel, <i>and</i> <i>reigned</i> two years in Tirzah. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:30–33">⚓</a>Now his servant Zimri, commander of half <i>his</i> chariots, conspired against him as he was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 24:2; 39:4; 1 Kin. 18:3">⚓</a>steward of <i>his</i> house in Tirzah. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_10"><sup>10</sup>And Zimri went in and struck him and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he was seated on his throne, <i>that</i> he killed all the household of Baasha; he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:22">⚓</a>did not leave him one male, neither of his relatives nor of his friends. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_12"><sup>12</sup>Thus Zimri destroyed all the household of Baasha, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:3">⚓</a>according to the word of the Lord, which He spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_13"><sup>13</sup>for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, by which they had sinned and by which they had made Israel sin, in provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:21; 1 Sam. 12:21; (Is. 41:29; Jon. 2:8; 1 Cor. 8:4; 10:19)">⚓</a>with their idols.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_14"> <sup>14</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Zimri Reigns in Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_15"> <sup>15</sup>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri had reigned in Tirzah seven days. And the people <i>were</i> encamped <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:27">⚓</a>against Gibbethon, which <i>belonged</i> to the Philistines. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_16"><sup>16</sup>Now the people <i>who</i> <i>were</i> encamped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired and also has killed the king.” So all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_17"><sup>17</sup>Then Omri and all Israel with him went up from Gibbethon, and they besieged Tirzah. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_18"><sup>18</sup>And it happened, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the citadel of the king’s house and burned the king’s house down upon himself with fire, and died, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_19"><sup>19</sup>because of the sins which he had committed in doing evil in the sight of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:26, 34">⚓</a>in walking in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:25–33">⚓</a>way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he had committed to make Israel sin.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_20"> <sup>20</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the treason he committed, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Omri Reigns in Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_22"><sup>22</sup>But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri reigned. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_23"><sup>23</sup>In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king over Israel, <i>and</i> <i>reigned</i> twelve years. Six years he reigned in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:21; 2 Kin. 15:14">⚓</a>Tirzah. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_24"><sup>24</sup>And he bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver; then he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 13:32; 2 Kin. 17:24; John 4:4">⚓</a>Samaria, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_25"><sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mic. 6:16">⚓</a>Omri did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse than all who <i>were</i> before him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_26"><sup>26</sup>For he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:19">⚓</a>walked in all the ways of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin by which he had made Israel sin, provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger with their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:13">⚓</a>idols.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_27"> <sup>27</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that he showed, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_28"> <sup>28</sup>So Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. Then Ahab his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ahab Reigns in Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_29"> <sup>29</sup>In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel; and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_30"><sup>30</sup>Now Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord, more than all who <i>were</i> before him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_31"><sup>31</sup>And it came to pass, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:3">⚓</a>that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 18:7; 1 Kin. 11:1–5">⚓</a>Sidonians; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:25, 26; 2 Kin. 10:18; 17:16">⚓</a>and he went and served Baal and worshiped him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_32"><sup>32</sup>Then he set up an altar for Baal in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 10:21, 26, 27">⚓</a>the temple of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_33"><sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 13:6">⚓</a>And Ahab made a wooden image. Ahab <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:9; 16:29, 30; 21:25">⚓</a>did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_16_34"><sup>34</sup>In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho. He laid its foundation with Abiram his firstborn, and with his youngest <i>son</i> Segub he set up its gates, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 6:26">⚓</a>according to the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through Joshua the son of Nun.<br/></span>
