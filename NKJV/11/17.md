<div class="title"><h1>17</h1><h3>Elijah Proclaims a Drought</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>And Elijah the Tishbite, of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 12:4">⚓</a>inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:10; 22:14; 2 Kin. 3:14; 5:20">⚓</a>“<i>As</i> the Lord God of Israel lives, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 10:8">⚓</a>before whom I stand, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:1; James 5:17">⚓</a>there shall not be dew nor rain <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:25">⚓</a>these years, except at my word.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_2"> <sup>2</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_3"><sup>3</sup>“Get away from here and turn eastward, and hide by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_4"><sup>4</sup>And it will be <i>that</i> you shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 38:41">⚓</a>ravens to feed you there.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_5"> <sup>5</sup>So he went and did according to the word of the Lord, for he went and stayed by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_6"><sup>6</sup>The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_7"><sup>7</sup>And it happened after a while that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Elijah and the Widow</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_9"><sup>9</sup>“Arise, go to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Obad. 20; Luke 4:25, 26">⚓</a>Zarephath, which <i>belongs</i> to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:6">⚓</a>Sidon, and dwell there. See, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_10"><sup>10</sup>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, indeed a widow <i>was</i> there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, “Please bring me a little water in a cup, that I may drink.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_11"><sup>11</sup>And as she was going to get <i>it,</i> he called to her and said, “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_12"> <sup>12</sup>So she said, “As the Lord your God lives, I do not have bread, only a handful of flour in a bin, and a little oil in a jar; and see, I <i>am</i> gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:23, 24">⚓</a>die.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_13"> <sup>13</sup>And Elijah said to her, “Do not fear; go <i>and</i> do as you have said, but make me a small cake from it first, and bring <i>it</i> to me; and afterward make <i>some</i> for yourself and your son. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_14"><sup>14</sup>For thus says the Lord God of Israel: ‘The bin of flour shall not be used up, nor shall the jar of oil run dry, until the day the Lord sends rain on the earth.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_15"> <sup>15</sup>So she went away and did according to the word of Elijah; and she and he and her household ate for <i>many</i> days. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_16"><sup>16</sup>The bin of flour was not used up, nor did the jar of oil run dry, according to the word of the Lord which He spoke by Elijah.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Elijah Revives the Widow’s Son</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now it happened after these things <i>that</i> the son of the woman who owned the house became sick. And his sickness was so serious that there was no breath left in him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_18"><sup>18</sup>So she said to Elijah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 5:8">⚓</a>“What have I to do with you, O man of God? Have you come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to kill my son?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_19"> <sup>19</sup>And he said to her, “Give me your son.” So he took him out of her arms and carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_20"><sup>20</sup>Then he cried out to the Lord and said, “O Lord my God, have You also brought tragedy on the widow with whom I lodge, by killing her son?” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:34, 35; Acts 20:10">⚓</a>And he stretched himself out on the child three times, and cried out to the Lord and said, “O Lord my God, I pray, let this child’s soul come back to him.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_22"><sup>22</sup>Then the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came back to him, and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:14, 15; Heb. 11:35">⚓</a>revived.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_23"> <sup>23</sup>And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper room into the house, and gave him to his mother. And Elijah said, “See, your son lives!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_17_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now by this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 2:11; 3:2; 16:30">⚓</a>I know that you <i>are</i> a man of God, <i>and</i> that the word of the Lord in your mouth <i>is</i> the truth.”<br/></span>
