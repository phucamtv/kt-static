<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>Elijah’s Message to Ahab</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>And it came to pass <i>after</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 17:1; Luke 4:25; James 5:17">⚓</a>many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, “Go, present yourself to Ahab, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:12">⚓</a>I will send rain on the earth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_2"> <sup>2</sup>So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab; and <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a severe famine in Samaria. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_3"><sup>3</sup>And Ahab had called Obadiah, who <i>was</i> in charge of <i>his</i> house. (Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_4"><sup>4</sup>For so it was, while Jezebel massacred the prophets of the Lord, that Obadiah had taken one hundred prophets and hidden them, fifty to a cave, and had fed them with bread and water.) </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_5"><sup>5</sup>And Ahab had said to Obadiah, “Go into the land to all the springs of water and to all the brooks; perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, so that we will not have to kill any livestock.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_6"><sup>6</sup>So they divided the land between them to explore it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now as Obadiah was on his way, suddenly Elijah met him; and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 1:6–8">⚓</a>recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, “<i>Is</i> that you, my lord Elijah?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_8"> <sup>8</sup>And he answered him, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> I. Go, tell your master, ‘Elijah <i>is</i> <i>here.</i>’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_9"> <sup>9</sup>So he said, “How have I sinned, that you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_10"><sup>10</sup><i>As</i> the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to hunt for you; and when they said, ‘<i>He</i> <i>is</i> not <i>here,</i>’ he took an oath from the kingdom or nation that they could not find you. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_11"><sup>11</sup>And now you say, ‘Go, tell your master, “Elijah <i>is</i> <i>here</i>” ’! </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_12"><sup>12</sup>And it shall come to pass, <i>as</i> <i>soon</i> <i>as</i> I am gone from you, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:16; Ezek. 3:12, 14; Matt. 4:1; Acts 8:39">⚓</a>the Spirit of the Lord will carry you to a place I do not know; so when I go and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he will kill me. But I your servant have feared the Lord from my youth. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_13"><sup>13</sup>Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord, how I hid one hundred men of the Lord’s prophets, fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water? </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_14"><sup>14</sup>And now you say, ‘Go, tell your master, “Elijah <i>is</i> <i>here.</i>” ’ He will kill me!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then Elijah said, “<i>As</i> the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely present myself to him today.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_16"> <sup>16</sup>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then it happened, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:20">⚓</a>“<i>Is</i> <i>that</i> you, O <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:25; Acts 16:20">⚓</a>troubler of Israel?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_18"> <sup>18</sup>And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house <i>have,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:30–33; (2 Chr. 15:2)">⚓</a>in that you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and have followed the Baals. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_19"><sup>19</sup>Now therefore, send <i>and</i> gather all Israel to me on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:26; 2 Kin. 2:25">⚓</a>Mount Carmel, the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:33">⚓</a>and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Elijah’s Mount Carmel Victory</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_20"> <sup>20</sup>So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:6">⚓</a>gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_21"><sup>21</sup>And Elijah came to all the people, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:41; (Matt. 6:24)">⚓</a>“How long will you falter between two opinions? If the Lord<i>is</i> God, follow Him; but if Baal, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:15">⚓</a>follow him.” But the people answered him not a word. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_22"><sup>22</sup>Then Elijah said to the people, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:10, 14">⚓</a>“I alone am left a prophet of the Lord; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:19">⚓</a>but Baal’s prophets <i>are</i> four hundred and fifty men. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_23"><sup>23</sup>Therefore let them give us two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and lay <i>it</i> on the wood, but put no fire <i>under</i> <i>it;</i> and I will prepare the other bull, and lay <i>it</i> on the wood, but put no fire <i>under</i> <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_24"><sup>24</sup>Then you call on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord; and the God who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:38; 1 Chr. 21:26">⚓</a>answers by fire, He is God.”<br/> So all the people answered and said, “It is well spoken.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare <i>it</i> first, for you <i>are</i> many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire <i>under</i> <i>it.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_26"> <sup>26</sup>So they took the bull which was given them, and they prepared <i>it,</i> and called on the name of Baal from morning even till noon, saying, “O Baal, hear us!” But <i>there</i> <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 115:5; Jer. 10:5; (1 Cor. 8:4)">⚓</a>no voice; no one answered. Then they leaped about the altar which they had made.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_27"> <sup>27</sup>And so it was, at noon, that Elijah mocked them and said, “Cry aloud, for he <i>is</i> a god; either he is meditating, or he is busy, or he is on a journey, <i>or</i> perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_28"><sup>28</sup>So they cried aloud, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 19:28; Deut. 14:1)">⚓</a>cut themselves, as was their custom, with knives and lances, until the blood gushed out on them. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_29"><sup>29</sup>And when midday was past, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:39, 41">⚓</a>they prophesied until the <i>time</i> of the offering of the <i>evening</i> sacrifice. But <i>there</i> <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:26">⚓</a>no voice; no one answered, no one paid attention.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_30"> <sup>30</sup>Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people came near to him. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:10, 14; 2 Chr. 33:16">⚓</a>And he repaired the altar of the Lord<i>that</i> <i>was</i> broken down. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_31"><sup>31</sup>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord had come, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:28; 35:10; 2 Kin. 17:34">⚓</a>“Israel shall be your name.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_32"><sup>32</sup>Then with the stones he built an altar <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 20:25; Col. 3:17)">⚓</a>in the name of the Lord; and he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_33"><sup>33</sup>And he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:9; Lev. 1:6–8">⚓</a>put the wood in order, cut the bull in pieces, and laid <i>it</i> on the wood, and said, “Fill four waterpots with water, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:20">⚓</a>pour <i>it</i> on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_34"><sup>34</sup>Then he said, “Do <i>it</i> a second time,” and they did <i>it</i> a second time; and he said, “Do <i>it</i> a third time,” and they did <i>it</i> a third time. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_35"><sup>35</sup>So the water ran all around the altar; and he also filled <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:32, 38">⚓</a>the trench with water.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_36"> <sup>36</sup>And it came to pass, at <i>the</i> <i>time</i> <i>of</i> the offering of the <i>evening</i> sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, “Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:13; Ex. 3:6; 4:5; (Matt. 22:32)">⚓</a>God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:43; 2 Kin. 19:19">⚓</a>let it be known this day that You <i>are</i> God in Israel and I <i>am</i> Your servant, and <i>that</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:28">⚓</a>I have done all these things at Your word. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_37"><sup>37</sup>Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that You <i>are</i> the Lord God, and <i>that</i> You have turned their hearts back <i>to</i> <i>You</i> again.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_38"> <sup>38</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:17; Lev. 9:24; 10:1, 2; Judg. 6:21; 2 Kin. 1:12; 1 Chr. 21:26; 2 Chr. 7:1; Job 1:16">⚓</a>the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood and the stones and the dust, and it licked up the water that <i>was</i> in the trench. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_39"><sup>39</sup>Now when all the people saw <i>it,</i> they fell on their faces; and they said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:21, 24">⚓</a>“The Lord, He <i>is</i> God! The Lord, He <i>is</i> God!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_40"> <sup>40</sup>And Elijah said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 10:25">⚓</a>“Seize the prophets of Baal! Do not let one of them escape!” So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the Brook <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 4:7; 5:21">⚓</a>Kishon and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 13:5; 18:20)">⚓</a>executed them there.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Drought Ends</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_41"> <sup>41</sup>Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for <i>there</i> <i>is</i> the sound of abundance of rain.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_42"><sup>42</sup>So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="James 5:17, 18">⚓</a>then he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_43"><sup>43</sup>and said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.”<br/> So he went up and looked, and said, “<i>There</i> <i>is</i> nothing.” And seven times he said, “Go again.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_44"> <sup>44</sup>Then it came to pass the seventh <i>time,</i> that he said, “There is a cloud, as small as a man’s hand, rising out of the sea!” So he said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Prepare <i>your</i> <i>chariot,</i> and go down before the rain stops you.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_45"> <sup>45</sup>Now it happened in the meantime that the sky became black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_18_46"><sup>46</sup>Then the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 3:15; Is. 8:11; Ezek. 3:14">⚓</a>hand of the Lord came upon Elijah; and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:29; 9:1; Jer. 1:17; 1 Pet. 1:13">⚓</a>girded up his loins and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.<br/></span>
