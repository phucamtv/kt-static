<div class="title"><h1>19</h1><h3>Elijah Escapes from Jezebel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, also how he had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:40">⚓</a>executed all the prophets with the sword. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_2"><sup>2</sup>Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:17; 1 Kin. 20:10; 2 Kin. 6:31">⚓</a>“So let the gods do <i>to</i> <i>me,</i> and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_3"><sup>3</sup>And when he saw <i>that,</i> he arose and ran for his life, and went to Beersheba, which <i>belongs</i> to Judah, and left his servant there.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_4"> <sup>4</sup>But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:15; Jer. 20:14–18; Jon. 4:3, 8">⚓</a>prayed that he might die, and said, “It is enough! Now, Lord, take my life, for I <i>am</i> no better than my fathers!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then as he lay and slept under a broom tree, suddenly an angel touched him, and said to him, “Arise <i>and</i> eat.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_6"><sup>6</sup>Then he looked, and there by his head <i>was</i> a cake baked on coals, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank, and lay down again. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_7"><sup>7</sup>And the angel of the Lord came back the second time, and touched him, and said, “Arise <i>and</i> eat, because the journey <i>is</i> too great for you.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_8"><sup>8</sup>So he arose, and ate and drank; and he went in the strength of that food forty days and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:18; 34:28; Deut. 9:9–11, 18; Matt. 4:2">⚓</a>forty nights as far as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:1; 4:27">⚓</a>Horeb, the mountain of God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_9"> <sup>9</sup>And there he went into a cave, and spent the night in that place; and behold, the word of the Lord<i>came</i> to him, and He said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_10"> <sup>10</sup>So he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 11:3">⚓</a>“I have been very <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 25:11, 13; Ps. 69:9">⚓</a>zealous for the Lord God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:4">⚓</a>killed Your prophets with the sword. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:22; Rom. 11:3">⚓</a>I alone am left; and they seek to take my life.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>God’s Revelation to Elijah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then He said, “Go out, and stand <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:20; 24:12, 18">⚓</a>on the mountain before the Lord.” And behold, the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 33:21, 22">⚓</a>passed by, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:4; 37:7">⚓</a>a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before the Lord, <i>but</i> the Lord<i>was</i> not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, <i>but</i> the Lord<i>was</i> not in the earthquake; </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_12"><sup>12</sup>and after the earthquake a fire, <i>but</i> the Lord<i>was</i> not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_13"> <sup>13</sup>So it was, when Elijah heard <i>it,</i> that he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:6; Is. 6:2">⚓</a>wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:9">⚓</a>Suddenly a voice <i>came</i> to him, and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:10">⚓</a>And he said, “I have been very zealous for the Lord God of hosts; because the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left; and they seek to take my life.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then the Lord said to him: “Go, return on your way to the Wilderness of Damascus; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:8–15">⚓</a>and when you arrive, anoint Hazael <i>as</i> king over Syria. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_16"><sup>16</sup>Also you shall anoint <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:1–10">⚓</a>Jehu the son of Nimshi <i>as</i> king over Israel. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:19–21; 2 Kin. 2:9–15">⚓</a>Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah you shall anoint <i>as</i> prophet in your place. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:12; 13:3, 22">⚓</a>It shall be <i>that</i> whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:14—10:28">⚓</a>kill; and whoever escapes the sword of Jehu, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Hos. 6:5)">⚓</a>Elisha will kill. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 11:4">⚓</a>Yet I have reserved seven thousand in Israel, all whose knees have not bowed to Baal, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 13:2">⚓</a>and every mouth that has not kissed him.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Elisha Follows Elijah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_19"> <sup>19</sup>So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who <i>was</i> plowing <i>with</i> twelve yoke <i>of</i> <i>oxen</i> before him, and he was with the twelfth. Then Elijah passed by him and threw his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 28:14; 2 Kin. 2:8, 13, 14">⚓</a>mantle on him. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_20"><sup>20</sup>And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 8:21, 22; Luke 9:61, 62); Acts 20:37">⚓</a>“Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and <i>then</i> I will follow you.”<br/> And he said to him, “Go back again, for what have I done to you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_19_21"> <sup>21</sup>So <i>Elisha</i> turned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:22">⚓</a>boiled their flesh, using the oxen’s equipment, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and followed Elijah, and became his servant.<br/></span>
