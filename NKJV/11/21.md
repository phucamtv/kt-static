<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>Naboth Is Murdered for His Vineyard</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>And it came to pass after these things <i>that</i> Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard which <i>was</i> in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:33; 1 Kin. 18:45, 46">⚓</a>Jezreel, next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_2"><sup>2</sup>So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:14">⚓</a>vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it <i>is</i> near, next to my house; and for it I will give you a vineyard better than it. <i>Or,</i> if it seems good to you, I will give you its worth in money.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_3"> <sup>3</sup>But Naboth said to Ahab, “The Lord forbid <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 25:23; Num. 36:7; Ezek. 46:18)">⚓</a>that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_4"> <sup>4</sup>So Ahab went into his house sullen and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him; for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no food. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_5"><sup>5</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:1, 2">⚓</a>Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, “Why is your spirit so sullen that you eat no food?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_6"> <sup>6</sup>He said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you <i>another</i> vineyard for it.’ And he answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then Jezebel his wife said to him, “You now exercise authority over Israel! Arise, eat food, and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_8"> <sup>8</sup>And she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed <i>them</i> with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who <i>were</i> dwelling in the city with Naboth. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_9"><sup>9</sup>She wrote in the letters, saying,<br/>  Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth with high honor among the people; </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_10">  <sup>10</sup>and seat two men, scoundrels, before him to bear witness against him, saying, “You have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 22:28; Lev. 24:15, 16); Acts 6:11">⚓</a>blasphemed God and the king.” <i>Then</i> take him out, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 24:14)">⚓</a>stone him, that he may die.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_11"> <sup>11</sup>So the men of his city, the elders and nobles who were inhabitants of his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, as it <i>was</i> written in the letters which she had sent to them. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 58:4">⚓</a>They proclaimed a fast, and seated Naboth with high honor among the people. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_13"><sup>13</sup>And two men, scoundrels, came in and sat before him; and the scoundrels <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 20:16; 23:1, 7)">⚓</a>witnessed against him, against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth has blasphemed God and the king!” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:26; 2 Chr. 24:21; Acts 7:58, 59; Heb. 11:37">⚓</a>Then they took him outside the city and stoned him with stones, so that he died. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_14"><sup>14</sup>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been stoned and is dead.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_15"> <sup>15</sup>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.” </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_16"><sup>16</sup>So it was, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Lord Condemns Ahab</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 9:12)">⚓</a>Then the word of the Lord came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:1">⚓</a>Elijah the Tishbite, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_18"><sup>18</sup>“Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 13:32; 2 Chr. 22:9">⚓</a>who <i>lives</i> in Samaria. There <i>he</i> <i>is,</i> in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_19"><sup>19</sup>You shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord: “Have you murdered and also taken possession?” ’ And you shall speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:38; 2 Kin. 9:26">⚓</a>“In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, dogs shall lick your blood, even yours.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_20"> <sup>20</sup>So Ahab said to Elijah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:17">⚓</a>“Have you found me, O my enemy?”<br/> And he answered, “I have found <i>you,</i> because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:25; 2 Kin. 17:17; (Rom. 7:14)">⚓</a>you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord: </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_21"><sup>21</sup>‘Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:10; 2 Kin. 9:8">⚓</a>I will bring calamity on you. I will take away your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 10:10">⚓</a>posterity, and will cut off from Ahab <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:22">⚓</a>every male in Israel, both <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:10">⚓</a>bond and free. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_22"><sup>22</sup>I will make your house like the house of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:29">⚓</a>Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:3, 11">⚓</a>Baasha the son of Ahijah, because of the provocation with which you have provoked <i>Me</i> to anger, and made Israel sin.’ </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_23"><sup>23</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:10, 30–37">⚓</a>concerning Jezebel the Lord also spoke, saying, ‘The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.’ </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_24"><sup>24</sup>The dogs shall eat <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:11; 16:4">⚓</a>whoever belongs to Ahab and dies in the city, and the birds of the air shall eat whoever dies in the field.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_25"> <sup>25</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:30–33; 21:20">⚓</a>there was no one like Ahab who sold himself to do wickedness in the sight of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:31">⚓</a>because Jezebel his wife stirred him up. </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_26"><sup>26</sup>And he behaved very abominably in following idols, according to all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:16; (Lev. 18:25–30); 2 Kin. 21:11">⚓</a><i>that</i> the Amorites had done, whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_27"> <sup>27</sup>So it was, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:34; 2 Sam. 3:31; 2 Kin. 6:30">⚓</a>put sackcloth on his body, and fasted and lay in sackcloth, and went about mourning.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_28"> <sup>28</sup>And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 1vua_21_29"><sup>29</sup>“See how Ahab has humbled himself before Me? Because he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Kin. 22:19)">⚓</a>has humbled himself before Me, I will not bring the calamity in his days. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:25; 10:11, 17">⚓</a>In the days of his son I will bring the calamity on his house.”<br/></span>
