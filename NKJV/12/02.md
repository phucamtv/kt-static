<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Elijah Ascends to Heaven</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>And it came to pass, when the Lord was about to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 5:24; (Heb. 11:5)">⚓</a>take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:16–21">⚓</a>Elisha from Gilgal. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_2"><sup>2</sup>Then Elijah said to Elisha, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:15, 16">⚓</a>“Stay here, please, for the Lord has sent me on to Bethel.”<br/> But Elisha said, “<i>As</i> the Lord lives, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:26; 2 Kin. 2:4, 6; 4:30">⚓</a><i>as</i> your soul lives, I will not leave you!” So they went down to Bethel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_3"> <sup>3</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 20:35; 2 Kin. 2:5, 7, 15; 4:1, 38; 9:1">⚓</a>the sons of the prophets who <i>were</i> at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that the Lord will take away your master from over you today?”<br/> And he said, “Yes, I know; keep silent!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here, please, for the Lord has sent me on to Jericho.”<br/> But he said, “<i>As</i> the Lord lives, and <i>as</i> your soul lives, I will not leave you!” So they came to Jericho.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now the sons of the prophets who <i>were</i> at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know that the Lord will take away your master from over you today?”<br/> So he answered, “Yes, I know; keep silent!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here, please, for the Lord has sent me on to the Jordan.”<br/> But he said, “<i>As</i> the Lord lives, and <i>as</i> your soul lives, I will not leave you!” So the two of them went on. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_7"><sup>7</sup>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood facing <i>them</i> at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_8"><sup>8</sup>Now Elijah took his mantle, rolled <i>it</i> up, and struck the water; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:21, 22; Josh. 3:16; 2 Kin. 2:14">⚓</a>it was divided this way and that, so that the two of them crossed over on dry <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:17">⚓</a>ground.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_9"> <sup>9</sup>And so it was, when they had crossed over, that Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask! What may I do for you, before I am taken away from you?”<br/> Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_10"> <sup>10</sup>So he said, “You have asked a hard thing. <i>Nevertheless,</i> if you see me <i>when</i> <i>I</i> <i>am</i> taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be <i>so.</i>” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_11"><sup>11</sup>Then it happened, as they continued on and talked, that suddenly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 6:17; Ps. 104:4">⚓</a>a chariot of fire <i>appeared</i> with horses of fire, and separated the two of them; and Elijah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 5:24; Heb. 11:5">⚓</a>went up by a whirlwind into heaven.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_12"> <sup>12</sup>And Elisha saw <i>it,</i> and he cried out, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 13:14">⚓</a>“My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!” So he saw him no more. And he took hold of his own clothes and tore them into two pieces. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_13"><sup>13</sup>He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_14"><sup>14</sup>Then he took the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, and said, “Where <i>is</i> the Lord God of Elijah?” And when he also had struck the water, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:8">⚓</a>it was divided this way and that; and Elisha crossed over.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_15"> <sup>15</sup>Now when the sons of the prophets who <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:7">⚓</a>from Jericho saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_16"><sup>16</sup>Then they said to him, “Look now, there are fifty strong men with your servants. Please let them go and search for your master, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:12; Ezek. 8:3; Acts 8:39">⚓</a>lest perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley.”<br/> And he said, “You shall not send anyone.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_17"> <sup>17</sup>But when they urged him till he was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:11">⚓</a>ashamed, he said, “Send <i>them!</i>” Therefore they sent fifty men, and they searched for three days but did not find him. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_18"><sup>18</sup>And when they came back to him, for he had stayed in Jericho, he said to them, “Did I not say to you, ‘Do not go’?”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Elisha Performs Miracles</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Please notice, the situation of this city <i>is</i> pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water <i>is</i> bad, and the ground barren.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_20"> <sup>20</sup>And he said, “Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.” So they brought <i>it</i> to him. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_21"><sup>21</sup>Then he went out to the source of the water, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:25, 26; 2 Kin. 4:41; 6:6; John 9:6">⚓</a>cast in the salt there, and said, “Thus says the Lord: ‘I have healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_22"><sup>22</sup>So the water remains <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 47:8, 9">⚓</a>healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then he went up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up the road, some youths came from the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_24"> <sup>24</sup>So he turned around and looked at them, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 27:13–26">⚓</a>pronounced a curse on them in the name of the Lord. And two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_2_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then he went from there to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:19, 20; 2 Kin. 4:25">⚓</a>Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.<br/></span>
