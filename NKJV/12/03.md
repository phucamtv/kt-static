<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Moab Rebels Against Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 1:17">⚓</a>Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_2"><sup>2</sup>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not like his father and mother; for he put away the <i>sacred</i> pillar of Baal <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:31, 32">⚓</a>that his father had made. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_3"><sup>3</sup>Nevertheless he persisted in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:28–32">⚓</a>the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin; he did not depart from them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheepbreeder, and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:2">⚓</a>regularly paid the king of Israel one hundred thousand <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 16:1, 2">⚓</a>lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_5"><sup>5</sup>But it happened, when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 1:1">⚓</a>Ahab died, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_6"> <sup>6</sup>So King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_7"><sup>7</sup>Then he went and sent to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?”<br/> And he said, “I will go up; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:4">⚓</a>I <i>am</i> as you <i>are,</i> my people as your people, my horses as your horses.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_8"><sup>8</sup>Then he said, “Which way shall we go up?”<br/> And he answered, “By way of the Wilderness of Edom.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_9"> <sup>9</sup>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched on that roundabout route seven days; and there was no water for the army, nor for the animals that followed them. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_10"><sup>10</sup>And the king of Israel said, “Alas! For the Lord has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_11"> <sup>11</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:7">⚓</a>Jehoshaphat said, “<i>Is</i> <i>there</i> no prophet of the Lord here, that we may inquire of the Lord by him?”<br/> So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, “Elisha the son of Shaphat <i>is</i> here, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:21; (John 13:4, 5, 13, 14)">⚓</a>poured water on the hands of Elijah.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_12"> <sup>12</sup>And Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the Lord is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:25">⚓</a>went down to him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ezek. 14:3)">⚓</a>“What have I to do with you? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 10:14; Ruth 1:15">⚓</a>Go to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:6–11">⚓</a>the prophets of your father and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:19">⚓</a>prophets of your mother.”<br/> But the king of Israel said to him, “No, for the Lord has called these three kings <i>together</i> to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_14"> <sup>14</sup>And Elisha said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 17:1; 2 Kin. 5:16">⚓</a>“<i>As</i> the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you, nor see you. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_15"><sup>15</sup>But now bring me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:5">⚓</a>a musician.”<br/> Then it happened, when the musician <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:16, 23; 1 Chr. 25:1">⚓</a>played, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:3; 3:14, 22; 8:1">⚓</a>the hand of the Lord came upon him. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_16"><sup>16</sup>And he said, “Thus says the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 14:3">⚓</a>‘Make this valley full of ditches.’ </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_17"><sup>17</sup>For thus says the Lord: ‘You shall not see wind, nor shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, so that you, your cattle, and your animals may drink.’ </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_18"><sup>18</sup>And this is a simple matter in the sight of the Lord; He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_19"><sup>19</sup>Also you shall attack every fortified city and every choice city, and shall cut down every good tree, and stop up every spring of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_20"> <sup>20</sup>Now it happened in the morning, when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:39, 40">⚓</a>the grain offering was offered, that suddenly water came by way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_21"> <sup>21</sup>And when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to bear arms and older were gathered; and they stood at the border. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_22"><sup>22</sup>Then they rose up early in the morning, and the sun was shining on the water; and the Moabites saw the water on the other side <i>as</i> red as blood. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_23"><sup>23</sup>And they said, “This is blood; the kings have surely struck swords and have killed one another; now therefore, Moab, to the spoil!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_24"> <sup>24</sup>So when they came to the camp of Israel, Israel rose up and attacked the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they entered <i>their</i> land, killing the Moabites. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_25"><sup>25</sup>Then they destroyed the cities, and each man threw a stone on every good piece of land and filled it; and they stopped up all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees. But they left the stones of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 16:7, 11; Jer. 48:31, 36">⚓</a>Kir Haraseth <i>intact.</i> However the slingers surrounded and attacked it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_26"> <sup>26</sup>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_3_27"><sup>27</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 18:10; Amos 2:1; Mic. 6:7)">⚓</a>he took his eldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him <i>as</i> a burnt offering upon the wall; and there was great indignation against Israel. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:20">⚓</a>So they departed from him and returned to <i>their</i> <i>own</i> land.<br/></span>
