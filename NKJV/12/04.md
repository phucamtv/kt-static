<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Elisha and the Widow’s Oil</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>A certain woman of the wives of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 20:35; 2 Kin. 2:3">⚓</a>the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, “Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the Lord. And the creditor is coming <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 25:39–41, 48); 1 Sam. 22:2; Neh. 5:2–5; Matt. 18:25">⚓</a>to take my two sons to be his slaves.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_2"> <sup>2</sup>So Elisha said to her, “What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?” And she said, “Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then he said, “Go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors—empty vessels; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 3:16">⚓</a>do not gather just a few. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_4"><sup>4</sup>And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; then pour it into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_5"> <sup>5</sup>So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought <i>the</i> <i>vessels</i> to her; and she poured <i>it</i> out. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_6"><sup>6</sup>Now it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.”<br/> And he said to her, “<i>There</i> <i>is</i> not another vessel.” So the oil ceased. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_7"><sup>7</sup>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, “Go, sell the oil and pay your debt; and you <i>and</i> your sons live on the rest.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Elisha Raises the Shunammite’s Son</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now it happened one day that Elisha went to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:18">⚓</a>Shunem, where there <i>was</i> a notable woman, and she persuaded him to eat some food. So it was, as often as he passed by, he would turn in there to eat some food. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_9"><sup>9</sup>And she said to her husband, “Look now, I know that this <i>is</i> a holy man of God, who passes by us regularly. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_10"><sup>10</sup>Please, let us make a small upper room on the wall; and let us put a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; so it will be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn in there.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_11"> <sup>11</sup>And it happened one day that he came there, and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_12"><sup>12</sup>Then he said to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:29–31; 5:20–27; 8:4, 5">⚓</a>Gehazi his servant, “Call this Shunammite woman.” When he had called her, she stood before him. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_13"><sup>13</sup>And he said to him, “Say now to her, ‘Look, you have been concerned for us with all this care. What <i>can</i> <i>I</i> do for you? Do you want me to speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?’ ”<br/> She answered, “I dwell among my own people.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_14"> <sup>14</sup>So he said, “What then <i>is</i> to be done for her?”<br/> And Gehazi answered, “Actually, she has no son, and her husband is old.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_15"> <sup>15</sup>So he said, “Call her.” When he had called her, she stood in the doorway. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_16"><sup>16</sup>Then he said, “About this time next year you shall embrace a son.”<br/> And she said, “No, my lord. Man of God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:28">⚓</a>do not lie to your maidservant!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_17"> <sup>17</sup>But the woman conceived, and bore a son when the appointed time had come, of which Elisha had told her.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_18"> <sup>18</sup>And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_19"><sup>19</sup>And he said to his father, “My head, my head!”<br/> So he said to a servant, “Carry him to his mother.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_20"><sup>20</sup>When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and <i>then</i> died. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_21"><sup>21</sup>And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut <i>the</i> <i>door</i> upon him, and went out. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_22"><sup>22</sup>Then she called to her husband, and said, “Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_23"> <sup>23</sup>So he said, “Why are you going to him today? <i>It</i> <i>is</i> neither the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 10:10; 28:11; 1 Chr. 23:31">⚓</a>New Moon nor the Sabbath.”<br/> And she said, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> well.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_24"><sup>24</sup>Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, “Drive, and go forward; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_25"><sup>25</sup>And so she departed, and went to the man of God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:25">⚓</a>at Mount Carmel.<br/> So it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, the Shunammite woman! </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_26"><sup>26</sup>Please run now to meet her, and say to her, ‘<i>Is</i> <i>it</i> well with you? <i>Is</i> <i>it</i> well with your husband? <i>Is</i> <i>it</i> well with the child?’ ”<br/> And she answered, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> well.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_27"><sup>27</sup>Now when she came to the man of God at the hill, she caught him by the feet, but Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said, “Let her alone; for her soul <i>is</i> in deep distress, and the Lord has hidden <i>it</i> from me, and has not told me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_28"> <sup>28</sup>So she said, “Did I ask a son of my lord? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:16">⚓</a>Did I not say, ‘Do not deceive me’?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then he said to Gehazi, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:46; 2 Kin. 9:1">⚓</a>“Get yourself ready, and take my staff in your hand, and be on your way. If you meet anyone, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:4">⚓</a>do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:19; 14:16; 2 Kin. 2:8, 14; Acts 19:12">⚓</a>lay my staff on the face of the child.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_30"> <sup>30</sup>And the mother of the child said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:2">⚓</a>“<i>As</i> the Lord lives, and <i>as</i> your soul lives, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:4">⚓</a>I will not leave you.” So he arose and followed her. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_31"><sup>31</sup>Now Gehazi went on ahead of them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but <i>there</i> <i>was</i> neither voice nor hearing. Therefore he went back to meet him, and told him, saying, “The child has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:11">⚓</a>not awakened.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_32"> <sup>32</sup>When Elisha came into the house, there was the child, lying dead on his bed. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_33"><sup>33</sup>He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:4; (Matt. 6:6); Luke 8:51">⚓</a>went in therefore, shut the door behind the two of them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 17:20">⚓</a>and prayed to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_34"><sup>34</sup>And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 17:21–23; Acts 20:10">⚓</a>he stretched himself out on the child, and the flesh of the child became warm. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_35"><sup>35</sup>He returned and walked back and forth in the house, and again went up <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 17:21">⚓</a>and stretched himself out on him; then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:1, 5">⚓</a>the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_36"><sup>36</sup>And he called Gehazi and said, “Call this Shunammite woman.” So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, “Pick up your son.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_37"><sup>37</sup>So she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground; then she <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 17:23; (Heb. 11:35)">⚓</a>picked up her son and went out.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Elisha Purifies the Pot of Stew</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_38"> <sup>38</sup>And Elisha returned to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:1">⚓</a>Gilgal, and <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:1">⚓</a>famine in the land. Now the sons of the prophets <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:39; Acts 22:3">⚓</a>sitting before him; and he said to his servant, “Put on the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_39"><sup>39</sup>So one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced <i>them</i> into the pot of stew, though they did not know <i>what</i> <i>they</i> <i>were.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_40"><sup>40</sup>Then they served it to the men to eat. Now it happened, as they were eating the stew, that they cried out and said, “Man of God, <i>there</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 10:17">⚓</a>death in the pot!” And they could not eat <i>it.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_41"> <sup>41</sup>So he said, “Then bring some flour.” And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:25; 2 Kin. 2:21">⚓</a>he put <i>it</i> into the pot, and said, “Serve <i>it</i> to the people, that they may eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Elisha Feeds One Hundred Men</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_42"> <sup>42</sup>Then a man came from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:4">⚓</a>Baal Shalisha, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:7; (1 Cor. 9:11; Gal. 6:6)">⚓</a>and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley bread, and newly ripened grain in his knapsack. And he said, “Give <i>it</i> to the people, that they may eat.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_43"> <sup>43</sup>But his servant said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 9:13; John 6:9">⚓</a>“What? Shall I set this before one hundred men?”<br/> He said again, “Give it to the people, that they may eat; for thus says the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 9:17; John 6:11">⚓</a>‘They shall eat and have <i>some</i> left over.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_4_44"><sup>44</sup>So he set <i>it</i> before them; and they ate <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:20; 15:37; John 6:13">⚓</a>and had <i>some</i> left over, according to the word of the Lord.<br/></span>
