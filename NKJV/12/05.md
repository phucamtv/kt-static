<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Naaman’s Leprosy Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:27">⚓</a>Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 11:3">⚓</a>a great and honorable man in the eyes of his master, because by him the Lord had given victory to Syria. He was also a mighty man of valor, <i>but</i> a leper. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_2"><sup>2</sup>And the Syrians had gone out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 6:23; 13:20">⚓</a>on raids, and had brought back captive a young girl from the land of Israel. She waited on Naaman’s wife. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_3"><sup>3</sup>Then she said to her mistress, “If only my master <i>were</i> with the prophet who <i>is</i> in Samaria! For he would heal him of his leprosy.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_4"><sup>4</sup>And <i>Naaman</i> went in and told his master, saying, “Thus and thus said the girl who <i>is</i> from the land of Israel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the king of Syria said, “Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.”<br/> So he departed and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:8; 2 Kin. 8:8, 9">⚓</a>took with him ten talents of silver, six thousand <i>shekels</i> of gold, and ten changes of clothing. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_6"><sup>6</sup>Then he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which said,<br/>  Now be advised, when this letter comes to you, that I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_7"> <sup>7</sup>And it happened, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he tore his clothes and said, “<i>Am</i> I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 30:2; Deut. 32:39; 1 Sam. 2:6)">⚓</a>God, to kill and make alive, that this man sends a man to me to heal him of his leprosy? Therefore please consider, and see how he seeks a quarrel with me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_8"> <sup>8</sup>So it was, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Please let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then Naaman went with his horses and chariot, and he stood at the door of Elisha’s house. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_10"><sup>10</sup>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, “Go and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:41; John 9:7">⚓</a>wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored to you, and <i>you</i> <i>shall</i> be clean.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_11"><sup>11</sup>But Naaman became furious, and went away and said, “Indeed, I said to myself, ‘He will surely come out <i>to</i> <i>me,</i> and stand and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place, and heal the leprosy.’ </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_12"><sup>12</sup><i>Are</i> not the Abanah and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_13"><sup>13</sup>And his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 28:23">⚓</a>servants came near and spoke to him, and said, “My father, <i>if</i> the prophet had told you <i>to</i> <i>do</i> something great, would you not have done <i>it?</i> How much more then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean’?” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_14"><sup>14</sup>So he went down and dipped seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 5:10; Job 33:25">⚓</a>flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:27; 5:13">⚓</a>he was clean.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_15"> <sup>15</sup>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his aides, and came and stood before him; and he said, “Indeed, now I know that <i>there</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:47; 3:29; 6:26, 27">⚓</a>no God in all the earth, except in Israel; now therefore, please take <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:11">⚓</a>a gift from your servant.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_16"> <sup>16</sup>But he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 3:14">⚓</a>“<i>As</i> the Lord lives, before whom I stand, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:22, 23; 2 Kin. 5:20, 26; (Matt. 10:8); Acts 8:18, 20">⚓</a>I will receive nothing.” And he urged him to take <i>it,</i> but he refused.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_17"> <sup>17</sup>So Naaman said, “Then, if not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth; for your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_18"><sup>18</sup>Yet in this thing may the Lord pardon your servant: when my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 7:2, 17">⚓</a>he leans on my hand, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon—when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the Lord please pardon your servant in this thing.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then he said to him, “Go in peace.” So he departed from him a short distance.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Gehazi’s Greed</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_20"> <sup>20</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:12; 8:4, 5">⚓</a>Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Look, my master has spared Naaman this Syrian, while not receiving from his hands what he brought; but <i>as</i> the Lord lives, I will run after him and take something from him.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_21"><sup>21</sup>So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw <i>him</i> running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him, and said, “<i>Is</i> all well?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_22"> <sup>22</sup>And he said, “All <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:26">⚓</a>well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Indeed, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the mountains of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of garments.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_23"> <sup>23</sup>So Naaman said, “Please, take two talents.” And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and handed <i>them</i> to two of his servants; and they carried <i>them</i> on ahead of him. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_24"><sup>24</sup>When he came to the citadel, he took <i>them</i> from their hand, and stored <i>them</i> away in the house; then he let the men go, and they departed. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_25"><sup>25</sup>Now he went in and stood before his master. Elisha said to him, “Where <i>did</i> <i>you</i> <i>go,</i> Gehazi?”<br/> And he said, “Your servant did not go anywhere.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then he said to him, “Did not my heart go <i>with</i> <i>you</i> when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you? <i>Is</i> <i>it</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eccl. 3:1, 6)">⚓</a>time to receive money and to receive clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male and female servants? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_5_27"><sup>27</sup>Therefore the leprosy of Naaman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Tim. 6:10)">⚓</a>shall cling to you and your descendants forever.” And he went out from his presence <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:6; Num. 12:10; 2 Kin. 15:5">⚓</a>leprous, <i>as</i> <i>white</i> as snow.<br/></span>
