<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>The Floating Ax Head</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:38">⚓</a>the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “See now, the place where we dwell with you is too small for us. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_2"><sup>2</sup>Please, let us go to the Jordan, and let every man take a beam from there, and let us make there a place where we may dwell.”<br/> So he answered, “Go.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then one said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 5:23">⚓</a>“Please consent to go with your servants.”<br/> And he answered, “I will go.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_4"><sup>4</sup>So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_5"><sup>5</sup>But as one was cutting down a tree, the iron <i>ax</i> <i>head</i> fell into the water; and he cried out and said, “Alas, master! For it was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 22:14)">⚓</a>borrowed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_6"> <sup>6</sup>So the man of God said, “Where did it fall?” And he showed him the place. So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:25; 2 Kin. 2:21; 4:41">⚓</a>he cut off a stick, and threw <i>it</i> in there; and he made the iron float. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_7"><sup>7</sup>Therefore he said, “Pick <i>it</i> up for yourself.” So he reached out his hand and took it.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Blinded Syrians Captured</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:28, 29">⚓</a>king of Syria was making war against Israel; and he consulted with his servants, saying, “My camp <i>will</i> <i>be</i> in such and such a place.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_9"><sup>9</sup>And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, “Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are coming down there.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_10"><sup>10</sup>Then the king of Israel sent <i>someone</i> to the place of which the man of God had told him. Thus he warned him, and he was watchful there, not just once or twice.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_11"> <sup>11</sup>Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, “Will you not show me which of us <i>is</i> for the king of Israel?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_12"> <sup>12</sup>And one of his servants said, “None, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who <i>is</i> in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_13"> <sup>13</sup>So he said, “Go and see where he <i>is,</i> that I may send and get him.”<br/> And it was told him, saying, “Surely <i>he</i> <i>is</i> in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:17">⚓</a>Dothan.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_14"> <sup>14</sup>Therefore he sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_15"><sup>15</sup>And when the servant of the man of God arose early and went out, there was an army, surrounding the city with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_16"> <sup>16</sup>So he answered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:13; 1 Kin. 17:13">⚓</a>“Do not fear, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 32:7; Ps. 55:18; (Rom. 8:31)">⚓</a>those who <i>are</i> with us <i>are</i> more than those who <i>are</i> with them.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_17"><sup>17</sup>And Elisha prayed, and said, “Lord, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.” Then the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:31; Luke 24:31">⚓</a>opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw. And behold, the mountain <i>was</i> full of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:11; Ps. 34:7; 68:17; Zech. 1:8; 6:1–7">⚓</a>horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_18"><sup>18</sup>So when <i>the</i> <i>Syrians</i> came down to him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, and said, “Strike this people, I pray, with blindness.” And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:11; Acts 13:11">⚓</a>He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_19"> <sup>19</sup>Now Elisha said to them, “This <i>is</i> not the way, nor <i>is</i> this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.” But he led them to Samaria.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_20"> <sup>20</sup>So it was, when they had come to Samaria, that Elisha said, “Lord, open the eyes of these <i>men,</i> that they may see.” And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and there <i>they</i> <i>were,</i> inside Samaria!<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_21"> <sup>21</sup>Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, “My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:12; 5:13; 8:9">⚓</a>father, shall I kill <i>them?</i> Shall I kill <i>them?</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_22"> <sup>22</sup>But he answered, “You shall not kill <i>them.</i> Would you kill those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 12:20)">⚓</a>Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_23"><sup>23</sup>Then he prepared a great feast for them; and after they ate and drank, he sent them away and they went to their master. So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 5:2; 6:8, 9">⚓</a>the bands of Syrian <i>raiders</i> came no more into the land of Israel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Syria Besieges Samaria in Famine</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_24"> <sup>24</sup>And it happened after this that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 20:1">⚓</a>Ben-Hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_25"><sup>25</sup>And there was a great <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:38; 8:1">⚓</a>famine in Samaria; and indeed they besieged it until a donkey’s head was <i>sold</i> for eighty <i>shekels</i> of silver, and one-fourth of a kab of dove droppings for five <i>shekels</i> of silver.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then, as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_27"> <sup>27</sup>And he said, “If the Lord does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or from the winepress?” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_28"><sup>28</sup>Then the king said to her, “What is troubling you?”<br/> And she answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’ </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_29"><sup>29</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:27–29; Deut. 28:52–57; Lam. 4:10">⚓</a>we boiled my son, and ate him. And I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son, that we may eat him’; but she has hidden her son.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_30"> <sup>30</sup>Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:27">⚓</a>tore his clothes; and as he passed by on the wall, the people looked, and there underneath <i>he</i> <i>had</i> sackcloth on his body. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_31"><sup>31</sup>Then he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:17; 1 Kin. 19:2">⚓</a>“God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_32"> <sup>32</sup>But Elisha was sitting in his house, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 8:1; 14:1; 20:1">⚓</a>the elders were sitting with him. And <i>the</i> <i>king</i> sent a man ahead of him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 13:32">⚓</a>“Do you see how this son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:4, 13, 14; 21:10, 13">⚓</a>a murderer has sent someone to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door. <i>Is</i> not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_6_33"><sup>33</sup>And while he was still talking with them, there was the messenger, coming down to him; and then <i>the</i> <i>king</i> said, “Surely this calamity <i>is</i> from the Lord; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 2:9">⚓</a>why should I wait for the Lord any longer?”<br/></span>
