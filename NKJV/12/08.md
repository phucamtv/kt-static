<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>The King Restores the Shunammite’s Land</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Elisha spoke to the woman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:18, 31–35">⚓</a>whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Arise and go, you and your household, and stay wherever you can; for the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:16; Hag. 1:11">⚓</a>has called for a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 21:1; 1 Kin. 18:2; 2 Kin. 4:38; 6:25">⚓</a>famine, and furthermore, it will come upon the land for seven years.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_2"><sup>2</sup>So the woman arose and did according to the saying of the man of God, and she went with her household and dwelt in the land of the Philistines seven years.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_3"> <sup>3</sup>It came to pass, at the end of seven years, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines; and she went to make an appeal to the king for her house and for her land. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_4"><sup>4</sup>Then the king talked with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:12; 5:20–27">⚓</a>Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, “Tell me, please, all the great things Elisha has done.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_5"><sup>5</sup>Now it happened, as he was telling the king how he had restored the dead to life, that there was the woman whose son he had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:35">⚓</a>restored to life, appealing to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, this <i>is</i> the woman, and this <i>is</i> her son whom Elisha restored to life.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_6"><sup>6</sup>And when the king asked the woman, she told him.<br/> So the king appointed a certain officer for her, saying, “Restore all that <i>was</i> hers, and all the proceeds of the field from the day that she left the land until now.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Ben-Hadad</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then Elisha went to Damascus, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 6:24">⚓</a>Ben-Hadad king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, “The man of God has come here.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_8"><sup>8</sup>And the king said to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:15">⚓</a>Hazael, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:7; 1 Kin. 14:3; 2 Kin. 5:5">⚓</a>“Take a present in your hand, and go to meet the man of God, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 1:2">⚓</a>inquire of the Lord by him, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this disease?’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_9"><sup>9</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:15">⚓</a>Hazael went to meet him and took a present with him, of every good thing of Damascus, forty camel-loads; and he came and stood before him, and said, “Your son Ben-Hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, ‘Shall I recover from this disease?’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_10"> <sup>10</sup>And Elisha said to him, “Go, say to him, ‘You shall certainly recover.’ However the Lord has shown me that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:15">⚓</a>he will really die.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_11"><sup>11</sup>Then he set his countenance in a stare until he was ashamed; and the man of God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 19:41">⚓</a>wept. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_12"><sup>12</sup>And Hazael said, “Why is my lord weeping?”<br/> He answered, “Because I know <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 10:32; 12:17; 13:3, 7; Amos 1:3, 4">⚓</a>the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: Their strongholds you will set on fire, and their young men you will kill with the sword; and you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:16; Hos. 13:16; Amos 1:13; Nah. 3:10">⚓</a>will dash their children, and rip open their women with child.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_13"> <sup>13</sup>So Hazael said, “But what <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:43; 2 Sam. 9:8">⚓</a><i>is</i> your servant—a dog, that he should do this gross thing?”<br/> And Elisha answered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:15">⚓</a>“The Lord has shown me that you <i>will</i> <i>become</i> king over Syria.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he answered, “He told me you would surely recover.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_15"><sup>15</sup>But it happened on the next day that he took a thick cloth and dipped <i>it</i> in water, and spread <i>it</i> over his face so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his place.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jehoram Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_16"> <sup>16</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 1:17; 3:1">⚓</a>in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat <i>having</i> <i>been</i> king of Judah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:3">⚓</a>Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat began to reign as king of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_17"><sup>17</sup>He was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:5–10">⚓</a>thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_18"><sup>18</sup>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:26, 27">⚓</a>the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the sight of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_19"><sup>19</sup>Yet the Lord would not destroy Judah, for the sake of His servant David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:13; 1 Kin. 11:36; 15:4; 2 Chr. 21:7">⚓</a>as He promised him to give a lamp to him <i>and</i> his sons forever.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_20"> <sup>20</sup>In his days <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:40; 2 Chr. 21:8–10">⚓</a>Edom revolted against Judah’s authority, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:47">⚓</a>and made a king over themselves. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_21"><sup>21</sup>So Joram went to Zair, and all his chariots with him. Then he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots; and the troops fled to their tents. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_22"><sup>22</sup>Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah’s authority to this day. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 21:13; 2 Kin. 19:8; 2 Chr. 21:10">⚓</a>And Libnah revolted at that time.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_23"> <sup>23</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_24"><sup>24</sup>So Joram rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 22:1, 7">⚓</a>Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ahaziah Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_25"> <sup>25</sup>In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_26"><sup>26</sup>Ahaziah <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 22:2">⚓</a>twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name <i>was</i> Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri, king of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 22:3, 4">⚓</a>And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the Lord, like the house of Ahab, for he <i>was</i> the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_28"> <sup>28</sup>Now he went <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 22:5">⚓</a>with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:3, 29">⚓</a>Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_8_29"><sup>29</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:15">⚓</a>King Joram went back to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which the Syrians had inflicted on him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:16; 2 Chr. 22:6, 7">⚓</a>And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.<br/></span>
