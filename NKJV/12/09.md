<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>Jehu Anointed King of Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>And Elisha the prophet called one of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 20:35">⚓</a>the sons of the prophets, and said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:29; Jer. 1:17">⚓</a>“Get yourself ready, take this flask of oil in your hand, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:28, 29">⚓</a>and go to Ramoth Gilead. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_2"><sup>2</sup>Now when you arrive at that place, look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, and go in and make him rise up from among <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:5, 11">⚓</a>his associates, and take him to an inner room. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_3"><sup>3</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:16">⚓</a>take the flask of oil, and pour <i>it</i> on his head, and say, ‘Thus says the Lord: “I have anointed you king over Israel.” ’ Then open the door and flee, and do not delay.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_4"> <sup>4</sup>So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_5"><sup>5</sup>And when he arrived, there <i>were</i> the captains of the army sitting; and he said, “I have a message for you, Commander.”<br/> Jehu said, “For which <i>one</i> of us?”<br/> And he said, “For you, Commander.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_6"><sup>6</sup>Then he arose and went into the house. And he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:7, 8; 1 Kin. 19:16; 2 Kin. 9:3; 2 Chr. 22:7">⚓</a>“Thus says the Lord God of Israel: ‘I have anointed you king over the people of the Lord, over Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_7"><sup>7</sup>You shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 32:35, 41)">⚓</a>avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:4; 21:15">⚓</a>at the hand of Jezebel. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_8"><sup>8</sup>For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:10; 21:21; 2 Kin. 10:17">⚓</a>I will cut off from Ahab all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:22">⚓</a>the males in Israel, both <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:36; 2 Kin. 14:26">⚓</a>bond and free. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_9"><sup>9</sup>So I will make the house of Ahab like the house of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:10; 15:29; 21:22">⚓</a>Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:3, 11">⚓</a>Baasha the son of Ahijah. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:23; 2 Kin. 9:35, 36">⚓</a>The dogs shall eat Jezebel on the plot <i>of</i> <i>ground</i> at Jezreel, and <i>there</i> <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> none to bury <i>her.</i>’ ” And he opened the door and fled.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then Jehu came out to the servants of his master, and <i>one</i> said to him, “<i>Is</i> all well? Why did <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 29:26; Hos. 9:7; Mark 3:21; John 10:20; Acts 26:24; (1 Cor. 4:10)">⚓</a>this madman come to you?”<br/> And he said to them, “You know the man and his babble.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_12"> <sup>12</sup>And they said, “A lie! Tell us now.”<br/> So he said, “Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord: “I have anointed you king over Israel.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then each man hastened <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:7, 8; Mark 11:7, 8">⚓</a>to take his garment and put <i>it</i> under him on the top of the steps; and they blew trumpets, saying, “Jehu is king!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Joram of Israel Killed</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_14"> <sup>14</sup>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:28">⚓</a>Joram. (Now Joram had been defending Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, against Hazael king of Syria. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_15"><sup>15</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:29">⚓</a>King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which the Syrians had inflicted on him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, “If you are so minded, let no one leave <i>or</i> escape from the city to go and tell <i>it</i> in Jezreel.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_16"><sup>16</sup>So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram was laid up there; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:29">⚓</a>and Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now a watchman stood on the tower in Jezreel, and he saw the company of Jehu as he came, and said, “I see a company of men.”<br/> And Joram said, “Get a horseman and send him to meet them, and let him say, ‘<i>Is</i> <i>it</i> peace?’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_18"> <sup>18</sup>So the horseman went to meet him, and said, “Thus says the king: ‘<i>Is</i> <i>it</i> peace?’ ”<br/> And Jehu said, “What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me.”<br/> So the watchman reported, saying, “The messenger went to them, but is not coming back.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then he sent out a second horseman who came to them, and said, “Thus says the king: ‘<i>Is</i> <i>it</i> peace?’ ”<br/> And Jehu answered, “What have you to do with peace? Turn around and follow me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_20"> <sup>20</sup>So the watchman reported, saying, “He went up to them and is not coming back; and the driving <i>is</i> like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Joram said, “Make ready.” And his chariot was made ready. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:17; 2 Chr. 22:7">⚓</a>Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot; and they went out to meet Jehu, and met him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:1–14">⚓</a>on the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_22"> <sup>22</sup>Now it happened, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, “<i>Is</i> <i>it</i> peace, Jehu?”<br/> So he answered, “What peace, as long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcraft <i>are</i> <i>so</i> many?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then Joram turned around and fled, and said to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_24"><sup>24</sup>Now Jehu drew his bow with full strength and shot Jehoram between his arms; and the arrow came out at his heart, and he sank down in his chariot. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_25"><sup>25</sup>Then <i>Jehu</i> said to Bidkar his captain, “Pick <i>him</i> up, <i>and</i> throw him into the tract of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember, when you and I were riding together behind Ahab his father, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:19, 24–29">⚓</a>the Lord laid this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 13:1">⚓</a>burden upon him: </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_26"><sup>26</sup>‘Surely I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,’ says the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:13, 19">⚓</a>‘and I will repay you in this plot,’ says the Lord. Now therefore, take <i>and</i> throw him on the plot <i>of</i> <i>ground,</i> according to the word of the Lord.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ahaziah of Judah Killed</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_27"> <sup>27</sup>But when Ahaziah king of Judah saw <i>this,</i> he fled by the road to Beth Haggan. So Jehu pursued him, and said, “Shoot him also in the chariot.” <i>And</i> <i>they</i> <i>shot</i> <i>him</i> at the Ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. Then he fled to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 22:7, 9">⚓</a>Megiddo, and died there. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_28"><sup>28</sup>And his servants carried him in the chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb with his fathers in the City of David. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_29"><sup>29</sup>In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jezebel’s Violent Death</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_30"> <sup>30</sup>Now when Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard <i>of</i> <i>it;</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 4:30); Ezek. 23:40">⚓</a>and she put paint on her eyes and adorned her head, and looked through a window. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_31"><sup>31</sup>Then, as Jehu entered at the gate, she said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:9–20; 2 Kin. 9:18–22">⚓</a>“<i>Is</i> <i>it</i> peace, Zimri, murderer of your master?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_32"> <sup>32</sup>And he looked up at the window, and said, “Who <i>is</i> on my side? Who?” So two <i>or</i> three eunuchs looked out at him. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_33"><sup>33</sup>Then he said, “Throw her down.” So they threw her down, and <i>some</i> of her blood spattered on the wall and on the horses; and he trampled her underfoot. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_34"><sup>34</sup>And when he had gone in, he ate and drank. Then he said, “Go now, see to this accursed <i>woman,</i> and bury her, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 22:28); 1 Kin. 16:31">⚓</a>she was a king’s daughter.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_35"><sup>35</sup>So they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of <i>her</i> hands. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_36"><sup>36</sup>Therefore they came back and told him. And he said, “This <i>is</i> the word of the Lord, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:23">⚓</a>‘On the plot <i>of</i> <i>ground</i> at Jezreel dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel; </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_9_37"><sup>37</sup>and the corpse of Jezebel shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 83:10">⚓</a>as refuse on the surface of the field, in the plot at Jezreel, so that they shall not say, “Here <i>lies</i> Jezebel.” ’ ”<br/></span>
