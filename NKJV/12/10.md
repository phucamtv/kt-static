<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>Ahab’s Seventy Sons Killed</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote and sent letters to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to those who reared Ahab’s <i>sons,</i> saying:<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_2">  <sup>2</sup>Now as soon as this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons <i>are</i> with you, and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and weapons, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_3">  <sup>3</sup>choose the best qualified of your master’s sons, set <i>him</i> on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_4"> <sup>4</sup>But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, “Look, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:24, 27">⚓</a>two kings could not stand up to him; how then can we stand?” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_5"><sup>5</sup>And he who <i>was</i> in charge of the house, and he who <i>was</i> in charge of the city, the elders also, and those who reared <i>the</i> <i>sons,</i> sent to Jehu, saying, “We <i>are</i> your servants, we will do all you tell us; but we will not make anyone king. Do <i>what</i> <i>is</i> good in your sight.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_6"><sup>6</sup>Then he wrote a second letter to them, saying:<br/>  If you <i>are</i> for me and will obey my voice, take the heads of the men, your master’s sons, and come to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow.<br/> Now the king’s sons, seventy persons, <i>were</i> with the great men of the city, <i>who</i> were rearing them. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_7"><sup>7</sup>So it was, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:5; 1 Kin. 21:21; 2 Kin. 11:1">⚓</a>slaughtered seventy persons, put their heads in baskets and sent <i>them</i> to him at Jezreel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then a messenger came and told him, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.”<br/> And he said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_9"> <sup>9</sup>So it was, in the morning, that he went out and stood, and said to all the people, “You <i>are</i> righteous. Indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:14–24">⚓</a>I conspired against my master and killed him; but who killed all these? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_10"><sup>10</sup>Know now that nothing shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:19; 1 Kin. 8:56; Jer. 44:28">⚓</a>fall to the earth of the word of the Lord which the Lord spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for the Lord has done what He spoke <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:17–24, 29">⚓</a>by His servant Elijah.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_11"><sup>11</sup>So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and his close acquaintances and his priests, until he left him none remaining.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ahaziah’s Forty-two Brothers Killed</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_12"> <sup>12</sup>And he arose and departed and went to Samaria. On the way, at Beth Eked of the Shepherds, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 22:8">⚓</a>Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, “Who <i>are</i> you?”<br/> So they answered, “We <i>are</i> the brothers of Ahaziah; we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_14"> <sup>14</sup>And he said, “Take them alive!” So they took them alive, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 22:8">⚓</a>killed them at the well of Beth Eked, forty-two men; and he left none of them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Rest of Ahab’s Family Killed</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_15"> <sup>15</sup>Now when he departed from there, he met <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 35:6">⚓</a>Jehonadab the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 2:55">⚓</a>Rechab, <i>coming</i> to meet him; and he greeted him and said to him, “Is your heart right, as my heart <i>is</i> toward your heart?”<br/> And Jehonadab answered, “It is.”<br/> <i>Jehu</i> <i>said,</i> “If it is, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 10:19; Ezek. 17:18">⚓</a>give <i>me</i> your hand.” So he gave <i>him</i> his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_16"><sup>16</sup>Then he said, “Come with me, and see my <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:10">⚓</a>zeal for the Lord.” So they had him ride in his chariot. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_17"><sup>17</sup>And when he came to Samaria, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:8; 2 Chr. 22:8">⚓</a>he killed all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed them, according to the word of the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:21, 29">⚓</a>which He spoke to Elijah.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Worshipers of Baal Killed</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:31, 32">⚓</a>“Ahab served Baal a little, Jehu will serve him much. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_19"><sup>19</sup>Now therefore, call to me all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:19; 22:6">⚓</a>prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests. Let no one be missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever is missing shall not live.” But Jehu acted deceptively, with the intent of destroying the worshipers of Baal. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_20"><sup>20</sup>And Jehu said, “Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.” So they proclaimed <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_21"><sup>21</sup>Then Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left who did not come. So they came into the temple of Baal, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:32; 2 Kin. 11:18">⚓</a>temple of Baal was full from one end to the other. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_22"><sup>22</sup>And he said to the one in charge of the wardrobe, “Bring out vestments for all the worshipers of Baal.” So he brought out vestments for them. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_23"><sup>23</sup>Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab went into the temple of Baal, and said to the worshipers of Baal, “Search and see that no servants of the Lord are here with you, but only the worshipers of Baal.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_24"><sup>24</sup>So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed for himself eighty men on the outside, and had said, “<i>If</i> any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escapes, <i>whoever</i> <i>lets</i> <i>him</i> <i>escape, it shall be</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 20:39">⚓</a>his life for the life of the other.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now it happened, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, “Go in <i>and</i> kill them; let no one come out!” And they killed them with the edge of the sword; then the guards and the officers threw <i>them</i> out, and went into the inner room of the temple of Baal. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_26"><sup>26</sup>And they brought the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 7:5, 25); 1 Kin. 14:23; 2 Kin. 3:2">⚓</a><i>sacred</i> pillars out of the temple of Baal and burned them. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_27"><sup>27</sup>Then they broke down the <i>sacred</i> pillar of Baal, and tore down the temple of Baal and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 6:11; Dan. 2:5; 3:29">⚓</a>made it a refuse dump to this day. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_28"><sup>28</sup>Thus Jehu destroyed Baal from Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_29"> <sup>29</sup>However Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin, <i>that</i> <i>is,</i> from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:28–30; 13:33, 34">⚓</a>the golden calves that <i>were</i> at Bethel and Dan. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_30"><sup>30</sup>And the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:6, 7">⚓</a>said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in doing <i>what</i> <i>is</i> right in My sight, <i>and</i> have done to the house of Ahab all that <i>was</i> in My heart, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 13:1, 10; 14:23; 15:8, 12">⚓</a>your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth <i>generation.</i>” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_31"><sup>31</sup>But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart; for he did not depart from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:16">⚓</a>the sins of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Jehu</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_32"> <sup>32</sup>In those days the Lord began to cut off <i>parts</i> of Israel; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:17; 2 Kin. 8:12; 13:22">⚓</a>Hazael conquered them in all the territory of Israel </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_33"><sup>33</sup>from the Jordan eastward: all the land of Gilead—Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh—from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:36">⚓</a>Aroer, which <i>is</i> by the River Arnon, including <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 1:3–5">⚓</a>Gilead and Bashan.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_34"> <sup>34</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, all that he did, and all his might, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_35"><sup>35</sup>So Jehu rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 13:1">⚓</a>Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_10_36"><sup>36</sup>And the period that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria <i>was</i> twenty-eight years.<br/></span>
