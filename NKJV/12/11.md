<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>Athaliah Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>When <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 22:10">⚓</a>Athaliah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:26">⚓</a>the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:27">⚓</a>dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal heirs. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_2"><sup>2</sup>But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:25">⚓</a>Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons <i>who</i> <i>were</i> being murdered; and they hid him and his nurse in the bedroom, from Athaliah, so that he was not killed. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_3"><sup>3</sup>So he was hidden with her in the house of the Lord for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Joash Crowned King of Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_4"> <sup>4</sup>In <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:2; 2 Chr. 23:1">⚓</a>the seventh year Jehoiada sent and brought the captains of hundreds—of the bodyguards and the escorts—and brought them into the house of the Lord to him. And he made a covenant with them and took an oath from them in the house of the Lord, and showed them the king’s son. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_5"><sup>5</sup>Then he commanded them, saying, “This <i>is</i> what you shall do: one-third of you who come on duty <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 9:25">⚓</a>on the Sabbath shall be keeping watch over the king’s house, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_6"><sup>6</sup>one-third <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> at the gate of Sur, and one-third at the gate behind the escorts. You shall keep the watch of the house, lest it be broken down. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_7"><sup>7</sup>The two contingents of you who go off duty on the Sabbath shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord for the king. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_8"><sup>8</sup>But you shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes within range, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 23:8">⚓</a>So the captains of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each of them took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath, with those who were going off duty on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_10"><sup>10</sup>And the priest gave the captains of hundreds the spears and shields which <i>had</i> <i>belonged</i> to King David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:7; 1 Chr. 18:7">⚓</a>that were in the temple of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_11"><sup>11</sup>Then the escorts stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, all around the king, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, by the altar and the house. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_12"><sup>12</sup>And he brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, and <i>gave</i> <i>him</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:16; 31:18">⚓</a>Testimony; they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:24">⚓</a>“Long live the king!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Athaliah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:26; 2 Chr. 23:12">⚓</a>Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the escorts <i>and</i> the people, she came to the people <i>in</i> the temple of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_14"><sup>14</sup>When she looked, there was the king standing by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:3; 2 Chr. 34:31">⚓</a>a pillar according to custom; and the leaders and the trumpeters were by the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. So Athaliah tore her clothes and cried out, “Treason! Treason!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_15"> <sup>15</sup>And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the army, and said to them, “Take her outside under guard, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not let her be killed in the house of the Lord.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_16"><sup>16</sup>So they seized her; and she went by way of the horses’ entrance <i>into</i> the king’s house, and there she was killed.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 23:16">⚓</a>Then Jehoiada <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:24, 25; 2 Chr. 15:12–15">⚓</a>made a covenant between the Lord, the king, and the people, that they should be the Lord’s people, and <i>also</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:3">⚓</a>between the king and the people. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_18"><sup>18</sup>And all the people of the land went to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 10:26, 27">⚓</a>temple of Baal, and tore it down. They thoroughly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 12:3)">⚓</a>broke in pieces its altars and images, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:40; 2 Kin. 10:11">⚓</a>killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 23:18">⚓</a>the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_19"><sup>19</sup>Then he took the captains of hundreds, the bodyguards, the escorts, and all the people of the land; and they brought the king down from the house of the Lord, and went by way of the gate of the escorts to the king’s house. Then he sat on the throne of the kings. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_20"><sup>20</sup>So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword <i>in</i> the king’s house. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_11_21"><sup>21</sup>Jehoash <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 24:1–14">⚓</a>seven years old when he became king.<br/></span>
