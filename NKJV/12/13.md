<div class="title"><h1>13</h1><h3>Jehoahaz Reigns in Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the twenty-third year of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:1">⚓</a>Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 10:35">⚓</a>Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel in Samaria, <i>and</i> <i>reigned</i> seventeen years. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_2"><sup>2</sup>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and followed the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:26–33">⚓</a>sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin. He did not depart from them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:14">⚓</a>the anger of the Lord was aroused against Israel, and He delivered them into the hand of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:12">⚓</a>Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 1:4">⚓</a>Ben-Hadad the son of Hazael, all <i>their</i> days. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_4"><sup>4</sup>So Jehoahaz <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 78:34)">⚓</a>pleaded with the Lord, and the Lord listened to him; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 3:7, 9; Judg. 2:18); 2 Kin. 14:26">⚓</a>He saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 13:25; 14:25, 27; Neh. 9:27">⚓</a>Then the Lord gave Israel a deliverer, so that they escaped from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as before. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_6"><sup>6</sup>Nevertheless they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had made Israel sin, <i>but</i> walked in them; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:33">⚓</a>and the wooden image also remained in Samaria. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_7"><sup>7</sup>For He left of the army of Jehoahaz only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers; for the king of Syria had destroyed them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 10:32">⚓</a>and made them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Amos 1:3)">⚓</a>like the dust at threshing.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, all that he did, and his might, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_9"><sup>9</sup>So Jehoahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. Then Joash his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jehoash Reigns in Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_10"> <sup>10</sup>In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria, <i>and</i> <i>reigned</i> sixteen years. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_11"><sup>11</sup>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, <i>but</i> walked in them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:8–15">⚓</a>Now the rest of the acts of Joash, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 13:14–19, 25">⚓</a>all that he did, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:9; 2 Chr. 25:17–25">⚓</a>his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_13"><sup>13</sup>So Joash <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:16">⚓</a>rested with his fathers. Then Jeroboam sat on his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Elisha</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_14"> <sup>14</sup>Elisha had become sick with the illness of which he would die. Then Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, “O my father, my father, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:12">⚓</a>the chariots of Israel and their horsemen!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_15"> <sup>15</sup>And Elisha said to him, “Take a bow and some arrows.” So he took himself a bow and some arrows. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_16"><sup>16</sup>Then he said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow.” So he put his hand <i>on</i> <i>it,</i> and Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_17"><sup>17</sup>And he said, “Open the east window”; and he opened <i>it.</i> Then Elisha said, “Shoot”; and he shot. And he said, “The arrow of the Lord’s deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria; for you must strike the Syrians at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 20:26">⚓</a>Aphek till you have destroyed <i>them.</i>” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_18"><sup>18</sup>Then he said, “Take the arrows”; so he took <i>them.</i> And he said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground”; so he struck three times, and stopped. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_19"><sup>19</sup>And the man of God was angry with him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times; then you would have struck Syria till you had destroyed <i>it!</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 13:25">⚓</a>But now you will strike Syria <i>only</i> three times.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then Elisha died, and they buried him. And the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 3:5; 24:2">⚓</a><i>raiding</i> bands from Moab invaded the land in the spring of the year. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_21"><sup>21</sup>So it was, as they were burying a man, that suddenly they spied a band <i>of</i> <i>raiders;</i> and they put the man in the tomb of Elisha; and when the man was let down and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood on his feet.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel Recaptures Cities from Syria</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_22"> <sup>22</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:12, 13">⚓</a>Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_23"><sup>23</sup>But the Lord was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:27">⚓</a>gracious to them, had compassion on them, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 2:24, 25)">⚓</a>regarded them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:16, 17; 17:2–7; Ex. 32:13">⚓</a>because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not yet destroy them or cast them from His presence.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_24"> <sup>24</sup>Now Hazael king of Syria died. Then Ben-Hadad his son reigned in his place. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_13_25"><sup>25</sup>And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz recaptured from the hand of Ben-Hadad, the son of Hazael, the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 13:18, 19">⚓</a>Three times Joash defeated him and recaptured the cities of Israel.<br/></span>
