<div class="title"><h1>14</h1><h3>Amaziah Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_1"> <sup>1</sup>In <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 13:10">⚓</a>the second year of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 25:1, 2">⚓</a>Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, became king. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_2"><sup>2</sup>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_3"><sup>3</sup>And he did <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in the sight of the Lord, yet not like his father David; he did everything <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:2">⚓</a>as his father Joash had done. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:3">⚓</a>However the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now it happened, as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he executed his servants <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:20">⚓</a>who had murdered his father the king. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_6"><sup>6</sup>But the children of the murderers he did not execute, according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, in which the Lord commanded, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 24:16; (Jer. 31:30; Ezek. 18:4, 20)">⚓</a>“Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall children be put to death for their fathers; but a person shall be put to death for his own sin.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_7"> <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 25:5–16">⚓</a>He killed ten thousand Edomites in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:13; 1 Chr. 18:12; Ps. 60:title">⚓</a>the Valley of Salt, and took Sela by war, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:38">⚓</a>and called its name Joktheel to this day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_8"> <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 25:17, 18">⚓</a>Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us face one another <i>in</i> <i>battle.</i>” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_9"><sup>9</sup>And Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:8–15">⚓</a>“The thistle that <i>was</i> in Lebanon sent to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 4:33">⚓</a>cedar that <i>was</i> in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife’; and a wild beast that <i>was</i> in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_10"><sup>10</sup>You have indeed defeated Edom, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:14; 2 Chr. 32:25; (Ezek. 28:2, 5, 17; Hab. 2:4)">⚓</a>your heart has lifted you up. Glory <i>in</i> <i>that,</i> and stay at home; for why should you meddle with trouble so that you fall—you and Judah with you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_11"> <sup>11</sup>But Amaziah would not heed. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went out; so he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:38; 21:16">⚓</a>Beth Shemesh, which <i>belongs</i> to Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_12"><sup>12</sup>And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_13"><sup>13</sup>Then Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh; and he went to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 8:16; 12:39">⚓</a>the Gate of Ephraim to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 31:38; Zech. 14:10">⚓</a>the Corner Gate—four hundred cubits. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_14"><sup>14</sup>And he took all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:51; 2 Kin. 12:18; 16:8">⚓</a>the gold and silver, all the articles that were found in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 13:12, 13">⚓</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did—his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah—<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_16"><sup>16</sup>So Jehoash rested with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. Then Jeroboam his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 25:25–28">⚓</a>Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_18"><sup>18</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_19"><sup>19</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 25:27">⚓</a>they formed a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:31">⚓</a>Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_20"><sup>20</sup>Then they brought him on horses, and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_21"> <sup>21</sup>And all the people of Judah took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:13; 2 Chr. 26:1">⚓</a>Azariah, who <i>was</i> sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_22"><sup>22</sup>He built <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:26; 2 Kin. 16:6; 2 Chr. 8:17">⚓</a>Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jeroboam II Reigns in Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_23"> <sup>23</sup>In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, became king in Samaria, <i>and</i> <i>reigned</i> forty-one years. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_24"><sup>24</sup>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord; he did not depart from all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:26–33">⚓</a>sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_25"><sup>25</sup>He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 10:32; 13:5, 25">⚓</a>restored the territory of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:21; 34:8; 1 Kin. 8:65">⚓</a>from the entrance of Hamath to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:17">⚓</a>the Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the Lord God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jon. 1:1; Matt. 12:39, 40">⚓</a>Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet who <i>was</i> from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:13">⚓</a>Gath Hepher. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_26"><sup>26</sup>For the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:7; 2 Kin. 13:4; Ps. 106:44">⚓</a>saw <i>that</i> the affliction of Israel <i>was</i> very bitter; and whether bond or free, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:36">⚓</a>there was no helper for Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Kin. 13:5, 23)">⚓</a>And the Lord did not say that He would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_28"> <sup>28</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did—his might, how he made war, and how he recaptured for Israel, from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:24">⚓</a>Damascus and Hamath, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:6; 1 Kin. 11:24; 2 Chr. 8:3">⚓</a><i>what</i> <i>had</i> <i>belonged</i> to Judah—<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_14_29"><sup>29</sup>So Jeroboam rested with his fathers, the kings of Israel. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:8">⚓</a>Zechariah his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
