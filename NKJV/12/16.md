<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>Ahaz Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Ahaz the son of Jotham, king of Judah, began to reign. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_2"><sup>2</sup>Ahaz <i>was</i> twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in the sight of the Lord his God, as his father David <i>had</i> <i>done.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_3"><sup>3</sup>But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel; indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 18:21); 2 Kin. 17:17; 2 Chr. 28:3; Ps. 106:37, 38; Is. 1:1">⚓</a>he made his son pass through the fire, according to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 12:31); 2 Kin. 21:2, 11">⚓</a>abominations of the nations whom the Lord had cast out from before the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_4"><sup>4</sup>And he sacrificed and burned incense on the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:34, 35">⚓</a>high places, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 12:2); 1 Kin. 14:23">⚓</a>on the hills, and under every green tree.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:37; Is. 7:1, 4">⚓</a>Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to <i>make</i> war; and they besieged Ahaz but could not overcome <i>him.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_6"><sup>6</sup>At that time Rezin king of Syria <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:22; 2 Chr. 26:2">⚓</a>captured Elath for Syria, and drove the men of Judah from Elath. Then the Edomites went to Elath, and dwell there to this day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_7"> <sup>7</sup>So Ahaz sent messengers to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:29; 1 Chr. 5:26; 2 Chr. 28:20">⚓</a>Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I <i>am</i> your servant and your son. Come up and save me from the hand of the king of Syria and from the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_8"><sup>8</sup>And Ahaz <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:17, 18; 2 Chr. 28:21">⚓</a>took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasuries of the king’s house, and sent <i>it</i> <i>as</i> a present to the king of Assyria. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_9"><sup>9</sup>So the king of Assyria heeded him; for the king of Assyria went up against <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:28">⚓</a>Damascus and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 1:5">⚓</a>took it, carried <i>its</i> <i>people</i> captive to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 22:6; Amos 9:7">⚓</a>Kir, and killed Rezin.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that <i>was</i> at Damascus; and King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the design of the altar and its pattern, according to all its workmanship. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_11"><sup>11</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 8:2">⚓</a>Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. So Urijah the priest made <i>it</i> before King Ahaz came back from Damascus. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_12"><sup>12</sup>And when the king came back from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 26:16, 19">⚓</a>the king approached the altar and made offerings on it. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_13"><sup>13</sup>So he burned his burnt offering and his grain offering; and he poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_14"><sup>14</sup>He also brought <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 27:1, 2; 40:6, 29; 2 Chr. 4:1">⚓</a>the bronze altar which <i>was</i> before the Lord, from the front of the temple—from between the <i>new</i> altar and the house of the Lord—and put it on the north side of the <i>new</i> altar. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_15"><sup>15</sup>Then King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, “On the great <i>new</i> altar burn <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:39–41">⚓</a>the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, the king’s burnt sacrifice, and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their grain offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice. And the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire <i>by.</i>” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_16"><sup>16</sup>Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that King Ahaz commanded.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 28:24">⚓</a>And King Ahaz cut off <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:27–29">⚓</a>the panels of the carts, and removed the lavers from them; and he took down <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:23–25">⚓</a>the Sea from the bronze oxen that <i>were</i> under it, and put it on a pavement of stones. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_18"><sup>18</sup>Also he removed the Sabbath pavilion which they had built in the temple, and he removed the king’s outer entrance from the house of the Lord, on account of the king of Assyria.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_19"> <sup>19</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_16_20"><sup>20</sup>So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 28:27">⚓</a>was buried with his fathers in the City of David. Then Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
