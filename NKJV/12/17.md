<span class="verse 2vua_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:30">⚓</a>Hoshea the son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria, <i>and</i> <i>he</i> <i>reigned</i> nine years. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_2"><sup>2</sup>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, but not as the kings of Israel who were before him. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:9–12">⚓</a>Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him; and Hoshea <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:1">⚓</a>became his vassal, and paid him tribute money. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_4"><sup>4</sup>And the king of Assyria uncovered a conspiracy by Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and brought no tribute to the king of Assyria, as <i>he</i> <i>had</i> <i>done</i> year by year. Therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel Carried Captive to Assyria</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:9; Hos. 13:16">⚓</a>the king of Assyria went throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:10, 11; Is. 7:7–9; Hos. 1:4; 13:16; Amos 4:2">⚓</a>In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:32, 33; (Deut. 28:36, 64; 29:27, 28)">⚓</a>carried Israel away to Assyria, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 5:26">⚓</a>and placed them in Halah and by the Habor, the River of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_7"> <sup>7</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Josh. 23:16)">⚓</a>so it was that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and they had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:10">⚓</a>feared other gods, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_8"><sup>8</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 18:3; Deut. 18:9); 2 Kin. 16:3">⚓</a>had walked in the statutes of the nations whom the Lord had cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_9"><sup>9</sup>Also the children of Israel secretly did against the Lord their God things that <i>were</i> not right, and they built for themselves high places in all their cities, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:8">⚓</a>from watchtower to fortified city. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:23; Is. 57:5">⚓</a>They set up for themselves <i>sacred</i> pillars and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 34:12–14; Deut. 16:21); Mic. 5:14">⚓</a>wooden images <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 12:2); 2 Kin. 16:4">⚓</a>on every high hill and under every green tree. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_11"><sup>11</sup>There they burned incense on all the high places, like the nations whom the Lord had carried away before them; and they did wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_12"><sup>12</sup>for they served idols, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 20:3–5; Lev. 26:1; Deut. 5:7, 8)">⚓</a>of which the Lord had said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 4:19)">⚓</a>“You shall not do this thing.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_13"> <sup>13</sup>Yet the Lord testified against Israel and against Judah, by all of His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:29, 30">⚓</a>prophets, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:9">⚓</a>every seer, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 18:11; 25:5; 35:15; Ezek. 18:31)">⚓</a>“Turn from your evil ways, and keep My commandments <i>and</i> My statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by My servants the prophets.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_14"><sup>14</sup>Nevertheless they would not hear, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:9; 33:3; Deut. 31:27; (Prov. 29:1; Acts 7:51)">⚓</a>stiffened their necks, like the necks of their fathers, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:23; Ps. 78:22">⚓</a>did not believe in the Lord their God. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_15"><sup>15</sup>And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 44:3">⚓</a>rejected His statutes <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:6–8; Deut. 29:25">⚓</a>and His covenant that He had made with their fathers, and His testimonies which He had testified against them; they followed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:21; 1 Kin. 16:31; (1 Cor. 8:4)">⚓</a>idols, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 13:7; Jer. 2:5; (Rom. 1:21–23)">⚓</a>became idolaters, and <i>went</i> after the nations who <i>were</i> all around them, <i>concerning</i> whom the Lord had charged them that they should <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 12:30, 31)">⚓</a>not do like them. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_16"><sup>16</sup>So they left all the commandments of the Lord their God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:8; 1 Kin. 12:28">⚓</a>made for themselves a molded image <i>and</i> two calves, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Kin. 14:15)">⚓</a>made a wooden image and worshiped all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 4:19)">⚓</a>host of heaven, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:31; 22:53">⚓</a>and served Baal. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 18:21); 2 Kin. 16:3; Ezek. 23:37">⚓</a>And they caused their sons and daughters to pass through the fire, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 19:26; Deut. 18:10–12)">⚓</a>practiced witchcraft and soothsaying, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:20">⚓</a>sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_18"><sup>18</sup>Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them from His sight; there was none left <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:13, 32">⚓</a>but the tribe of Judah alone.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_19"> <sup>19</sup>Also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 3:8">⚓</a>Judah did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_20"><sup>20</sup>And the Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel, afflicted them, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:14; 2 Kin. 13:3; 15:29">⚓</a>delivered them into the hand of plunderers, until He had cast them from His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:20">⚓</a>sight. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_21"><sup>21</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:11, 31">⚓</a>He tore Israel from the house of David, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:20, 28">⚓</a>they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. Then Jeroboam drove Israel from following the Lord, and made them commit a great sin. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_22"><sup>22</sup>For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_23"><sup>23</sup>until the Lord removed Israel out of His sight, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:16; Is. 8:4">⚓</a>as He had said by all His servants the prophets. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:6">⚓</a>So Israel was carried away from their own land to Assyria, <i>as</i> <i>it</i> <i>is</i> to this day.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Assyria Resettles Samaria</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_24"> <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 4:2, 10">⚓</a>Then the king of Assyria brought <i>people</i> from Babylon, Cuthah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:34">⚓</a>Ava, Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed <i>them</i> in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel; and they took possession of Samaria and dwelt in its cities. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_25"><sup>25</sup>And it was so, at the beginning of their dwelling there, <i>that</i> they did not fear the Lord; therefore the Lord sent lions among them, which killed <i>some</i> of them. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_26"><sup>26</sup>So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The nations whom you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the rituals of the God of the land; therefore He has sent lions among them, and indeed, they are killing them because they do not know the rituals of the God of the land.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_27"><sup>27</sup>Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, “Send there one of the priests whom you brought from there; let him go and dwell there, and let him teach them the rituals of the God of the land.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_28"><sup>28</sup>Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_29"> <sup>29</sup>However every nation continued to make gods of its own, and put <i>them</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:31; 13:32">⚓</a>in the shrines on the high places which the Samaritans had made, <i>every</i> nation in the cities where they dwelt. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_30"><sup>30</sup>The men of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:24">⚓</a>Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_31"><sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 4:9">⚓</a>and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 18:21; Deut. 12:31)">⚓</a>burned their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_32"><sup>32</sup>So they feared the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:31; 13:33">⚓</a>and from every class they appointed for themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the shrines of the high places. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_33"><sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zeph. 1:5">⚓</a>They feared the Lord, yet served their own gods—according to the rituals of the nations from among whom they were carried away.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_34"> <sup>34</sup>To this day they continue practicing the former rituals; they do not fear the Lord, nor do they follow their statutes or their ordinances, or the law and commandment which the Lord had commanded the children of Jacob, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:28; 35:10">⚓</a>whom He named Israel, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_35"><sup>35</sup>with whom the Lord had made a covenant and charged them, saying: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:10">⚓</a>“You shall not fear other gods, nor <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 20:5)">⚓</a>bow down to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them; </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_36"><sup>36</sup>but the Lord, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:15–30">⚓</a>brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:6; 9:15">⚓</a>an outstretched arm, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 10:20)">⚓</a>Him you shall fear, Him you shall worship, and to Him you shall offer sacrifice. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_37"><sup>37</sup>And the statutes, the ordinances, the law, and the commandment which He wrote for you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 5:32">⚓</a>you shall be careful to observe forever; you shall not fear other gods. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_38"><sup>38</sup>And the covenant that I have made with you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:23; 6:12">⚓</a>you shall not forget, nor shall you fear other gods. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_39"><sup>39</sup>But the Lord your God you shall fear; and He will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_40"><sup>40</sup>However they did not obey, but they followed their former rituals. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_17_41"><sup>41</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:32, 33">⚓</a>So these nations feared the Lord, yet served their carved images; also their children and their children’s children have continued doing as their fathers did, even to this day.<br/></span>
