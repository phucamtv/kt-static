<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>Hezekiah Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass in the third year of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:1">⚓</a>Hoshea the son of Elah, king of Israel, <i>that</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 28:27; 29:1">⚓</a>Hezekiah the son of Ahaz, king of Judah, began to reign. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_2"><sup>2</sup>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 38:5">⚓</a>Abi the daughter of Zechariah. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_3"><sup>3</sup>And he did <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father David had done.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 31:1">⚓</a>He removed the high places and broke the <i>sacred</i> pillars, cut down the wooden image and broke in pieces the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 21:5–9">⚓</a>bronze serpent that Moses had made; for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it, and called it Nehushtan. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_5"><sup>5</sup>He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:10; (Job 13:15; Ps. 13:5)">⚓</a>trusted in the Lord God of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:25">⚓</a>so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor who were before him. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_6"><sup>6</sup>For he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 10:20; Josh. 23:8">⚓</a>held fast to the Lord; he did not depart from following Him, but kept His commandments, which the Lord had commanded Moses. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_7"><sup>7</sup>The Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Chr. 15:2)">⚓</a>was with him; he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:2, 3; 1 Sam. 18:5, 14; Ps. 60:12">⚓</a>prospered wherever he went. And he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 16:7">⚓</a>rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 4:41; 2 Chr. 28:18; Is. 14:29">⚓</a>He subdued the Philistines, as far as Gaza and its territory, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:9">⚓</a>from watchtower to fortified city.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_9"> <sup>9</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:3">⚓</a>it came to pass in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which <i>was</i> the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah, king of Israel, <i>that</i> Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_10"><sup>10</sup>And at the end of three years they took it. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, that <i>is,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:6">⚓</a>the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:6; Hos. 1:4; Amos 4:2">⚓</a>Then the king of Assyria carried Israel away captive to Assyria, and put them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 5:26">⚓</a>in Halah and by the Habor, the River of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_12"><sup>12</sup>because they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:7–18">⚓</a>did not obey the voice of the Lord their God, but transgressed His covenant <i>and</i> all that Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded; and they would neither hear nor do <i>them.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_13"> <sup>13</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 32:1; Is. 36:1—39:8">⚓</a>in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_14"><sup>14</sup>Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have done wrong; turn away from me; whatever you impose on me I will pay.” And the king of Assyria assessed Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_15"><sup>15</sup>So Hezekiah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:18, 19; 2 Kin. 12:18; 16:8">⚓</a>gave <i>him</i> all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king’s house. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_16"><sup>16</sup>At that time Hezekiah stripped <i>the</i> <i>gold</i> <i>from</i> the doors of the temple of the Lord, and <i>from</i> the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Sennacherib Boasts Against the Lord</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then the king of Assyria sent <i>the</i> Tartan, <i>the</i> Rabsaris, <i> and the</i> Rabshakeh from Lachish, with a great army against Jerusalem, to King Hezekiah. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. When they had come up, they went and stood by the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:20">⚓</a>aqueduct from the upper pool, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 7:3">⚓</a>which <i>was</i> on the highway to the Fuller’s Field. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_18"><sup>18</sup>And when they had called to the king, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:2; Is. 22:20">⚓</a>Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who <i>was</i> over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to them. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_19"><sup>19</sup>Then <i>the</i> Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 32:10; (Ps. 118:8, 9)">⚓</a>“What confidence <i>is</i> this in which you trust? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_20"><sup>20</sup>You speak of <i>having</i> plans and power for war; but <i>they</i> <i>are</i> mere words. And in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 30:2–7; Ezek. 29:6, 7">⚓</a>Now look! You are trusting in the staff of this broken reed, Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So <i>is</i> Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_22"><sup>22</sup>But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the Lord our God,’ <i>is</i> it not He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:4; 2 Chr. 31:1; 32:12">⚓</a>whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem’?” ’ </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_23"><sup>23</sup>Now therefore, I urge you, give a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses—if you are able on your part to put riders on them! </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_24"><sup>24</sup>How then will you repel one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_25"><sup>25</sup>Have I now come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it? The Lord said to me, ‘Go up against this land, and destroy it.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_26"> <sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 36:11—39:8">⚓</a>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to <i>the</i> Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 4:7; Dan. 2:4">⚓</a>Aramaic, for we understand <i>it;</i> and do not speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people who <i>are</i> on the wall.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_27"> <sup>27</sup>But <i>the</i> Rabshakeh said to them, “Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat and drink their own waste with you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then <i>the</i> Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Hebrew, and spoke, saying, “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria! </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_29"><sup>29</sup>Thus says the king: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 32:15">⚓</a>‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you from his hand; </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_30"><sup>30</sup>nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying, “The Lord will surely deliver us; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” ’ </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_31"><sup>31</sup>Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make <i>peace</i> with me by a present and come out to me; and every one of you eat from his own <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 4:20, 25">⚓</a>vine and every one from his own fig tree, and every one of you drink the waters of his own cistern; </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_32"><sup>32</sup>until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:7–9; 11:12">⚓</a>a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive groves and honey, that you may live and not die. But do not listen to Hezekiah, lest he persuade you, saying, “The Lord will deliver us.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_33"><sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:12; Is. 10:10, 11">⚓</a>Has any of the gods of the nations at all delivered its land from the hand of the king of Assyria? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_34"><sup>34</sup>Where <i>are</i> the gods of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:13">⚓</a>Hamath and Arpad? Where <i>are</i> the gods of Sepharvaim and Hena and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:24">⚓</a>Ivah? Indeed, have they delivered Samaria from my hand? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_35"><sup>35</sup>Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their countries from my hand, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 3:15">⚓</a>that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_36"> <sup>36</sup>But the people held their peace and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, “Do not answer him.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_18_37"><sup>37</sup>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who <i>was</i> over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 33:7">⚓</a>with <i>their</i> clothes torn, and told him the words of <i>the</i> Rabshakeh.<br/></span>
