<span class="verse 2vua_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:13; 2 Chr. 32:20–22; Is. 37:1">⚓</a>so it was, when King Hezekiah heard <i>it,</i> that he tore his clothes, covered himself with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:11">⚓</a>sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_2"><sup>2</sup>Then he sent Eliakim, who <i>was</i> over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_3"><sup>3</sup>And they said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah: ‘This day <i>is</i> a day of trouble, and rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children have come to birth, but <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no strength to bring them forth. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:12">⚓</a>It may be that the Lord your God will hear all the words of <i>the</i> Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:35">⚓</a>reproach the living God, and will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 50:21">⚓</a>rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard. Therefore lift up <i>your</i> prayer for the remnant that is left.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_5"> <sup>5</sup>So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 37:6">⚓</a>And Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says the Lord: “Do not be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 112:7)">⚓</a>afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:17">⚓</a>servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_7"><sup>7</sup>Surely I will send <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:35–37; Jer. 51:1">⚓</a>a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Sennacherib’s Threat and Hezekiah’s Prayer</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then <i>the</i> Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he heard that he had departed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:14, 17">⚓</a>from Lachish. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_9"><sup>9</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 23:27; Is. 37:9">⚓</a>the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “Look, he has come out to make war with you.” So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_10"><sup>10</sup>“Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: ‘Do not let your God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:5">⚓</a>in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_11"><sup>11</sup>Look! You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them; and shall you be delivered? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:33, 34">⚓</a>Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the people of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 27:23">⚓</a>Eden who <i>were</i> in Telassar? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:34">⚓</a>Where <i>is</i> the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 37:14">⚓</a>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_15"><sup>15</sup>Then Hezekiah prayed before the Lord, and said: “O Lord God of Israel, <i>the</i> <i>One</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:22; Ps. 80:1; Is. 37:16">⚓</a>who dwells <i>between</i> the cherubim, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 44:6)">⚓</a>You are God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth.

<span class="verse 2vua_19_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 31:2; Is. 37:17">⚓</a>Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:29; 2 Chr. 6:40">⚓</a>open Your eyes, O Lord, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:4">⚓</a>which he has sent to reproach the living God. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_17"><sup>17</sup>Truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_18"><sup>18</sup>and have cast their gods into the fire; for they <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 44:9–20; Jer. 10:3–5)">⚓</a>not gods, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 115:4; Jer. 10:3; (Acts 17:29)">⚓</a>the work of men’s hands—wood and stone. Therefore they destroyed them. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_19"><sup>19</sup>Now therefore, O Lord our God, I pray, save us from his hand, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 83:18">⚓</a>that all the kingdoms of the earth may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:42, 43">⚓</a>know that You <i>are</i> the Lord God, You alone.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Word of the Lord Concerning Sennacherib</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the Lord God of Israel: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 37:21">⚓</a>‘Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:5; Ps. 65:2">⚓</a>I have heard.’ </span>

<span class="verse 2vua_19_23">   <sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:17">⚓</a>By your messengers you have reproached the Lord,<br/>   And said: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 20:7">⚓</a>“By the multitude of my chariots<br/>   I have come up to the height of the mountains,<br/>   To the limits of Lebanon;<br/>   I will cut down its tall cedars<br/>   <i>And</i> its choice cypress trees;<br/>   I will enter the extremity of its borders,<br/>   <i>To</i> its fruitful forest.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_24">   <sup>24</sup>I have dug and drunk strange water,<br/>   And with the soles of my feet I have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 19:6">⚓</a>dried up<br/>   All the brooks of defense.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_25">  <sup>25</sup>‘Did you not hear long ago<br/>   <i>How</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 45:7)">⚓</a>I made it,<br/>   From ancient times that I formed it?<br/>   Now I have brought it to pass,<br/>   That <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 10:5, 6">⚓</a>you should be<br/>   For crushing fortified cities <i>into</i> heaps of ruins.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_19_26">   <sup>26</sup>Therefore their inhabitants had little power;<br/>   They were dismayed and confounded;<br/>   They were <i>as</i> the grass of the field<br/>   And the green herb,<br/>   <i>As</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 129:6">⚓</a>the grass on the housetops<br/>   And <i>grain</i> blighted before it is grown.<br/></span>
