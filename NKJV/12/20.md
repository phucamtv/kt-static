<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>Hezekiah’s Life Extended</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>In <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:13; 2 Chr. 32:24; Is. 38:1–22">⚓</a>those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, went to him and said to him, “Thus says the Lord: ‘Set your house in order, for you shall die, and not live.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_2"> <sup>2</sup>Then he turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:3–6; Neh. 13:22">⚓</a>“Remember now, O Lord, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart, and have done <i>what</i> <i>was</i> good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_4"> <sup>4</sup>And it happened, before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court, that the word of the Lord came to him, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_5"><sup>5</sup>“Return and tell Hezekiah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:16; 10:1">⚓</a>the leader of My people, ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:20; Ps. 65:2">⚓</a>“I have heard your prayer, I have seen <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 39:12; 56:8">⚓</a>your tears; surely I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_6"><sup>6</sup>And I will add to your days fifteen years. I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:34; 2 Chr. 32:21">⚓</a>I will defend this city for My own sake, and for the sake of My servant David.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 38:21">⚓</a>Isaiah said, “Take a lump of figs.” So they took and laid <i>it</i> on the boil, and he recovered.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_8"> <sup>8</sup>And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:17, 37, 39; Is. 7:11, 14; 38:22">⚓</a>“What <i>is</i> the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I shall go up to the house of the Lord the third day?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then Isaiah said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:19; Is. 38:7, 8">⚓</a>“This is the sign to you from the Lord, that the Lord will do the thing which He has spoken: <i>shall</i> the shadow go forward ten degrees or go backward ten degrees?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_10"> <sup>10</sup>And Hezekiah answered, “It is an easy thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees; no, but let the shadow go backward ten degrees.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_11"> <sup>11</sup>So Isaiah the prophet cried out to the Lord, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:12–14; Is. 38:8">⚓</a>He brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down on the sundial of Ahaz.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Babylonian Envoys</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:8, 9; 2 Chr. 32:31; Is. 39:1–8">⚓</a>At that time Berodach-Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been sick. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_13"><sup>13</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 16:9; 2 Chr. 32:27, 31">⚓</a>Hezekiah was attentive to them, and showed them all the house of his treasures—the silver and gold, the spices and precious ointment, and all his armory—all that was found among his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?”<br/> So Hezekiah said, “They came from a far country, from Babylon.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_15"> <sup>15</sup>And he said, “What have they seen in your house?”<br/> So Hezekiah answered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:13">⚓</a>“They have seen all that <i>is</i> in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord: </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_17"><sup>17</sup>‘Behold, the days are coming when all that <i>is</i> in your house, and what your fathers have accumulated until this day, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:13; 25:13–15; 2 Chr. 36:10; Jer. 27:21, 22; 52:17">⚓</a>shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left,’ says the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_18"><sup>18</sup>‘And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:12; 2 Chr. 33:11">⚓</a>they shall take away some of your sons who will descend from you, whom you will beget; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 1:3–7">⚓</a>and they shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 1:11, 18">⚓</a>eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_19"> <sup>19</sup>So Hezekiah said to Isaiah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:18">⚓</a>“The word of the Lord which you have spoken <i>is</i> good!” For he said, “Will there not be peace and truth at least in my days?”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Hezekiah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 32:32">⚓</a>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah—all his might, and how he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 3:16">⚓</a>made a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:17; Is. 7:3">⚓</a>pool and a tunnel and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 32:3, 30">⚓</a>brought water into the city—<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_20_21"><sup>21</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 16:20; 2 Chr. 32:33">⚓</a>Hezekiah rested with his fathers. Then Manasseh his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
