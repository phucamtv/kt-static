<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>Manasseh Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>Manasseh <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 33:1–9">⚓</a><i>was</i> twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name <i>was</i> Hephzibah. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_2"><sup>2</sup>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 16:3">⚓</a>according to the abominations of the nations whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_3"><sup>3</sup>For he rebuilt the high places <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:4, 22">⚓</a>which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; he raised up altars for Baal, and made a wooden image, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:31–33">⚓</a>as Ahab king of Israel had done; and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 4:19; 17:2–5); 2 Kin. 17:16; 23:5">⚓</a>worshiped all the host of heaven and served them. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:30; 32:34">⚓</a>He also built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:13">⚓</a>“In Jerusalem I will put My name.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_5"><sup>5</sup>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:36; 7:12; 2 Kin. 23:12">⚓</a>two courts of the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 18:21; 20:2); 2 Kin. 16:3; 17:17">⚓</a>Also he made his son pass through the fire, practiced <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:26, 31; (Deut. 18:10–14); 2 Kin. 17:17">⚓</a>soothsaying, used witchcraft, and consulted spiritists and mediums. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke <i>Him</i> to anger. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_7"><sup>7</sup>He even set a carved image of Asherah that he had made, in the house of which the Lord had said to David and to Solomon his son, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:13; 1 Kin. 8:29; 9:3; 2 Kin. 23:27; 2 Chr. 7:12, 16; Jer. 32:34">⚓</a>“In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever; </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:10; (2 Kin. 18:11, 12)">⚓</a>and I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore from the land which I gave their fathers—only if they are careful to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.” </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_9"><sup>9</sup>But they paid no attention, and Manasseh <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 29:12)">⚓</a>seduced them to do more evil than the nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_10"> <sup>10</sup>And the Lord spoke <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:13">⚓</a>by His servants the prophets, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:26, 27; 24:3, 4">⚓</a>“Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations (<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:26">⚓</a>he has acted more wickedly than all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:16">⚓</a>Amorites who <i>were</i> before him, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 21:9">⚓</a>has also made Judah sin with his idols), </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_12"><sup>12</sup>therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel: ‘Behold, <i>I</i> am bringing <i>such</i> calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:11; Jer. 19:3">⚓</a>his ears will tingle. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_13"><sup>13</sup>And I will stretch over Jerusalem <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lam. 2:8; Amos 7:7, 8">⚓</a>the measuring line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 22:16–19; 25:4–11">⚓</a>I will wipe Jerusalem as <i>one</i> wipes a dish, wiping <i>it</i> and turning <i>it</i> upside down. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_14"><sup>14</sup>So I will forsake the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 6:9">⚓</a>remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become victims of plunder to all their enemies, </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_15"><sup>15</sup>because they have done evil in My sight, and have provoked Me to anger since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:4">⚓</a>Moreover Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides his sin by which he made Judah sin, in doing evil in the sight of the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 33:11–19">⚓</a>the rest of the acts of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:21">⚓</a>Manasseh—all that he did, and the sin that he committed—<i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_18"><sup>18</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 33:20">⚓</a>Manasseh rested with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. Then his son Amon reigned in his place.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Amon’s Reign and Death</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_19"> <sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 33:21–23">⚓</a>Amon <i>was</i> twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name <i>was</i> Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_20"><sup>20</sup>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 21:2–6, 11, 16">⚓</a>as his father Manasseh had done. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_21"><sup>21</sup>So he walked in all the ways that his father had walked; and he served the idols that his father had served, and worshiped them. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_22"><sup>22</sup>He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:12, 13; 1 Kin. 11:33; 1 Chr. 28:9">⚓</a>forsook the Lord God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_23"> <sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 3:14; 2 Chr. 33:24, 25; Matt. 1:10">⚓</a>Then the servants of Amon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:20; 14:19">⚓</a>conspired against him, and killed the king in his own house. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_24"><sup>24</sup>But the people of the land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:5">⚓</a>executed all those who had conspired against King Amon. Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_21_26"><sup>26</sup>And he was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza. Then Josiah his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
