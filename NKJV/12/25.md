<span class="verse 2vua_25_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:17; Jer. 6:6; 34:2; Ezek. 4:2; 24:1, 2; Hab. 1:6">⚓</a>in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and encamped against it; and they built a siege wall against it all around. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_2"><sup>2</sup>So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_3"><sup>3</sup>By the ninth <i>day</i> of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 6:24, 25; Is. 3:1; Jer. 39:2; Lam. 4:9, 10">⚓</a><i>fourth</i> month the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:2">⚓</a>the city wall was broken through, and all the men of war <i>fled</i> at night by way of the gate between two walls, which was by the king’s garden, even though the Chaldeans <i>were</i> still encamped all around against the city. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:4–7; Ezek. 12:12">⚓</a><i>the</i> <i>king</i> went by way of the plain. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_5"><sup>5</sup>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_6"><sup>6</sup>So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:33; Jer. 52:9">⚓</a>at Riblah, and they pronounced judgment on him. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_7"><sup>7</sup>Then they killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:7; Ezek. 17:16">⚓</a>put out the eyes of Zedekiah, bound him with bronze fetters, and took him to Babylon.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_8"> <sup>8</sup>And in the fifth month, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 52:12">⚓</a>on the seventh <i>day</i> of the month (which <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:12">⚓</a>the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:9">⚓</a>Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:13; 2 Chr. 36:19; Ps. 79:1; Jer. 7:14">⚓</a>He burned the house of the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:8">⚓</a>and the king’s house; all the houses of Jerusalem, that is, all the houses of the great, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 17:27">⚓</a>he burned with fire. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_10"><sup>10</sup>And all the army of the Chaldeans who <i>were</i> <i>with</i> the captain of the guard <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:13; Neh. 1:3">⚓</a>broke down the walls of Jerusalem all around.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 1:9; Jer. 5:19; 39:9">⚓</a>the rest of the people <i>who</i> remained in the city and the defectors who had deserted to the king of Babylon, with the rest of the multitude. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_12"><sup>12</sup>But the captain of the guard <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:14; Jer. 39:10; 40:7; 52:16">⚓</a>left <i>some</i> of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 52:17">⚓</a>The bronze <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:15">⚓</a>pillars that <i>were</i> in the house of the Lord, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:27">⚓</a>the carts and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:23">⚓</a>the bronze Sea that <i>were</i> in the house of the Lord, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:17; Jer. 27:19–22">⚓</a>carried their bronze to Babylon. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_14"><sup>14</sup>They also took away <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 27:3; 1 Kin. 7:45">⚓</a>the pots, the shovels, the trimmers, the spoons, and all the bronze utensils with which the priests ministered. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_15"><sup>15</sup>The firepans and the basins, the things of solid gold and solid silver, the captain of the guard took away. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_16"><sup>16</sup>The two pillars, one Sea, and the carts, which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:47">⚓</a>the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:15–22; Jer. 52:21">⚓</a>The height of one pillar <i>was</i> eighteen cubits, and the capital on it <i>was</i> of bronze. The height of the capital was three cubits, and the network and pomegranates all around the capital were all of bronze. The second pillar was the same, with a network.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:9–13; 52:12–16, 24">⚓</a>And the captain of the guard took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 6:14; Ezra 7:1">⚓</a>Seraiah the chief priest, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:1; 29:25, 29">⚓</a>Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_19"><sup>19</sup>He also took out of the city an officer who had charge of the men of war, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 1:14; Jer. 52:25">⚓</a>five men of the king’s close associates who were found in the city, the chief recruiting officer of the army, who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land <i>who</i> <i>were</i> found in the city. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_20"><sup>20</sup>So Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_21"><sup>21</sup>Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:33; Deut. 28:36, 64; 2 Kin. 23:27">⚓</a>Thus Judah was carried away captive from its own land.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Gedaliah Made Governor of Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then he made Gedaliah the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 22:12">⚓</a>Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor over <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 1:9; Jer. 40:5">⚓</a>the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_23"><sup>23</sup>Now when all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:7–9">⚓</a>captains of the armies, they and <i>their</i> men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Careah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_24"><sup>24</sup>And Gedaliah took an oath before them and their men, and said to them, “Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_25"> <sup>25</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 41:1–3">⚓</a>it happened in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men and struck and killed Gedaliah, the Jews, as well as the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_26"><sup>26</sup>And all the people, small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:31; Jer. 43:4–7">⚓</a>and went to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jehoiachin Released from Prison</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_27"> <sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:12, 15; Jer. 52:31–34">⚓</a>Now it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:13, 20">⚓</a>released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_28"><sup>28</sup>He spoke kindly to him, and gave him a more prominent seat than those of the kings who <i>were</i> with him in Babylon. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_29"><sup>29</sup>So Jehoiachin changed from his prison garments, and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 9:7">⚓</a>ate bread regularly before the king all the days of his life. </span>
<span class="verse 2vua_25_30"><sup>30</sup>And as for his provisions, <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a regular ration given him by the king, a portion for each day, all the days of his life.<br/></span>
