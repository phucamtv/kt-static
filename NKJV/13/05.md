<span class="verse 1su_5_7"><sup>7</sup>And his brethren by their families, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 5:17">⚓</a>when the genealogy of their generations was registered: the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah, </span>
<span class="verse 1su_5_8"><sup>8</sup>and Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 32:34; Josh. 12:2; 13:15, 16">⚓</a>Aroer, as far as Nebo and Baal Meon. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_5_9"><sup>9</sup>Eastward they settled as far as the entrance of the wilderness this side of the River Euphrates, because their cattle had multiplied <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 22:8, 9">⚓</a>in the land of Gilead.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_5_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now in the days of Saul they made war <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:12">⚓</a>with the Hagrites, who fell by their hand; and they dwelt in their tents throughout the entire <i>area</i> east of Gilead.<br/></span>

<span class="verse 1su_5_18"> <sup>18</sup>The sons of Reuben, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh <i>had</i> forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty valiant men, men able to bear shield and sword, to shoot with the bow, and skillful in war, who went to war. </span>

<span class="verse 1su_5_20"><sup>20</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Chr. 5:22)">⚓</a>they were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all who <i>were</i> with them, for they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 14:11–13">⚓</a>cried out to God in the battle.

<span class="verse 1su_5_21"><sup>21</sup>Then they took away their livestock—fifty thousand of their camels, two hundred and fifty thousand of their sheep, and two thousand of their donkeys—also one hundred thousand of their men; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_5_22"><sup>22</sup>for many fell dead, because the war <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Josh. 23:10; 2 Chr. 32:8; Rom. 8:31)">⚓</a><i>was</i> God’s.

<div class="title"><h3>The Family of Manasseh (East)</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1su_5_23"> <sup>23</sup>So the children of the half-tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land. Their <i>numbers</i> increased from Bashan to Baal Hermon, that is, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:9">⚓</a>Senir, or Mount Hermon. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_5_24"><sup>24</sup>These <i>were</i> the heads of their fathers’ houses: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel. They were mighty men of valor, famous men, <i>and</i> heads of their fathers’ houses.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_5_25"> <sup>25</sup>And they were unfaithful to the God of their fathers, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:7">⚓</a>played the harlot after the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them. </span>
