<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>David Made King over All Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1su_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:1">⚓</a>all Israel came together to David at Hebron, saying, “Indeed we <i>are</i> your bone and your flesh. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_2"><sup>2</sup>Also, in time past, even when Saul was king, you <i>were</i> the one who led Israel out and brought them in; and the Lord your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:1–3; Ps. 78:70–72">⚓</a>God said to you, ‘You shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:7">⚓</a>shepherd My people Israel, and be ruler over My people Israel.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_3"><sup>3</sup>Therefore all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:3">⚓</a>they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:1, 4, 12, 13">⚓</a>Samuel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The City of David</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1su_11_4"> <sup>4</sup>And David and all Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:6">⚓</a>went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:8, 63; Judg. 1:21; 19:10, 11">⚓</a>where the Jebusites <i>were,</i> the inhabitants of the land. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_5"><sup>5</sup>But the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You shall not come in here!” Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion (that is, the City of David). </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_6"><sup>6</sup>Now David said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.” And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and became chief. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_7"><sup>7</sup>Then David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore they called it the City of David. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_8"><sup>8</sup>And he built the city around it, from the Millo to the surrounding area. Joab repaired the rest of the city. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_9"><sup>9</sup>So David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:1">⚓</a>went on and became great, and the Lord of hosts <i>was</i> with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:18">⚓</a>him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Mighty Men of David</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1su_11_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 23:8">⚓</a>these <i>were</i> the heads of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king, according to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:1, 12">⚓</a>the word of the Lord concerning Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_11"> <sup>11</sup>And this <i>is</i> the number of the mighty men whom David had: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 27:2">⚓</a>Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 12:18">⚓</a>chief of the captains; he had lifted up his spear against three hundred, killed <i>by</i> <i>him</i> at one time.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_12"> <sup>12</sup>After him <i>was</i> Eleazar the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 27:4">⚓</a>Dodo, the Ahohite, who <i>was</i> <i>one</i> of the three mighty men. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_13"><sup>13</sup>He was with David at Pasdammim. Now there the Philistines were gathered for battle, and there was a piece of ground full of barley. So the people fled from the Philistines. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_14"><sup>14</sup>But they stationed themselves in the middle of <i>that</i> field, defended it, and killed the Philistines. So the Lord brought about a great victory.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_15"> <sup>15</sup>Now three of the thirty chief men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 23:13">⚓</a>went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines encamped <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:18; 1 Chr. 14:9">⚓</a>in the Valley of Rephaim. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_16"><sup>16</sup>David <i>was</i> then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines <i>was</i> then in Bethlehem. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_17"><sup>17</sup>And David said with longing, “Oh, that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!” </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_18"><sup>18</sup>So the three broke through the camp of the Philistines, drew water from the well of Bethlehem that <i>was</i> by the gate, and took <i>it</i> and brought <i>it</i> to David. Nevertheless David would not drink it, but poured it out to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_19"><sup>19</sup>And he said, “Far be it from me, O my God, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men <i>who</i> <i>have</i> <i>put</i> their lives <i>in</i> <i>jeopardy?</i> For at the risk of their lives they brought it.” Therefore he would not drink it. These things were done by the three mighty men.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 23:18; 1 Chr. 18:12">⚓</a>Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of <i>another</i> three. He had lifted up his spear against three hundred <i>men,</i> killed <i>them,</i> and won a name among <i>these</i> three. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 23:19">⚓</a>Of the three he was more honored than the other two men. Therefore he became their captain. However he did not attain to the <i>first</i> three.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_22"> <sup>22</sup>Benaiah was the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, who had done many deeds. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 23:20">⚓</a>He had killed two lion-like heroes of Moab. He also had gone down and killed a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_23"><sup>23</sup>And he killed an Egyptian, a man of <i>great</i> height, five cubits tall. In the Egyptian’s hand <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, wrested the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_24"><sup>24</sup>These <i>things</i> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and won a name among three mighty men. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_11_25"><sup>25</sup>Indeed he was more honored than the thirty, but he did not attain to the <i>first</i> three. And David appointed him over his guard.<br/></span>
