<span class="verse 1su_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 27:2">⚓</a>these <i>were</i> the men who came to David at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 27:6">⚓</a>Ziklag while he was still a fugitive from Saul the son of Kish; and they <i>were</i> among the mighty men, helpers in the war, </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_2"><sup>2</sup>armed with bows, using both the right hand and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:15; 20:16">⚓</a>the left in <i>hurling</i> stones and <i>shooting</i> arrows with the bow. <i>They</i> <i>were</i> of Benjamin, Saul’s brethren.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_3"> <sup>3</sup>The chief <i>was</i> Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Berachah, and Jehu the Anathothite; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_4"><sup>4</sup>Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_5"><sup>5</sup>Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_6"><sup>6</sup>Elkanah, Jisshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_7"><sup>7</sup>and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_8"> <sup>8</sup><i>Some</i> Gadites joined David at the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for battle, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces <i>were</i> <i>like</i> the faces of lions, and <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:18">⚓</a>as swift as gazelles on the mountains: </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_9"><sup>9</sup>Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_10"><sup>10</sup>Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_11"><sup>11</sup>Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_12"><sup>12</sup>Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_13"><sup>13</sup>Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbanai the eleventh. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_14"><sup>14</sup>These <i>were</i> from the sons of Gad, captains of the army; the least was over a hundred, and the greatest was over a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:13">⚓</a>thousand. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_15"><sup>15</sup>These <i>are</i> the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 3:15; 4:18, 19">⚓</a>banks; and they put to flight all <i>those</i> in the valleys, to the east and to the west.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_17"><sup>17</sup>And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if to betray me to my enemies, since <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers look and bring judgment.” </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_18"><sup>18</sup>Then the Spirit came upon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:25">⚓</a>Amasai, chief of the captains, <i>and</i> <i>he</i> <i>said:</i><br/>  “<i>We</i> <i>are</i> yours, O David;<br/>   We <i>are</i> on your side, O son of Jesse!<br/>   Peace, peace to you,<br/>   And peace to your helpers!<br/>   For your God helps you.”<br/> So David received them, and made them captains of the troop.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_19"> <sup>19</sup>And <i>some</i> from Manasseh defected to David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 29:2">⚓</a>when he was going with the Philistines to battle against Saul; but they did not help them, for the lords of the Philistines sent him away by agreement, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 29:4">⚓</a>“He may defect to his master Saul <i>and</i> <i>endanger</i> our heads.” </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_20"><sup>20</sup>When he went to Ziklag, those of Manasseh who defected to him were Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of the thousands who <i>were</i> from Manasseh. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_21"><sup>21</sup>And they helped David against <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 30:1, 9, 10">⚓</a>the bands <i>of</i> <i>raiders,</i> for they <i>were</i> all mighty men of valor, and they were captains in the army. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_22"><sup>22</sup>For at <i>that</i> time they came to David day by day to help him, until <i>it</i> <i>was</i> a great army, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:2; Josh. 5:13–15">⚓</a>like the army of God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David’s Army at Hebron</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1su_12_23"> <sup>23</sup>Now these <i>were</i> the numbers of the divisions <i>that</i> <i>were</i> equipped for war, <i>and</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:1–4">⚓</a>came to David at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 11:1">⚓</a>Hebron to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 10:14">⚓</a>turn <i>over</i> the kingdom of Saul to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:1–4">⚓</a>according to the word of the Lord: </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_24"><sup>24</sup>of the sons of Judah bearing shield and spear, six thousand eight hundred armed for war; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_25"><sup>25</sup>of the sons of Simeon, mighty men of valor fit for war, seven thousand one hundred; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_26"><sup>26</sup>of the sons of Levi four thousand six hundred; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_27"><sup>27</sup>Jehoiada, the leader of the Aaronites, and with him three thousand seven hundred; </span>

<span class="verse 1su_12_29"><sup>29</sup>of the sons of Benjamin, relatives of Saul, three thousand (until then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:8, 9">⚓</a>the greatest part of them had remained loyal to the house of Saul); </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_30"><sup>30</sup>of the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men throughout their father’s house; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_31"><sup>31</sup>of the half-tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were designated by name to come and make David king; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_32"><sup>32</sup>of the sons of Issachar <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 1:13">⚓</a>who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their chiefs were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their command; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_33"><sup>33</sup>of Zebulun there were fifty thousand who went out to battle, expert in war with all weapons of war, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 12:2; (James 1:8)">⚓</a>stouthearted men who could keep ranks; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_34"><sup>34</sup>of Naphtali one thousand captains, and with them thirty-seven thousand with shield and spear; </span>

<span class="verse 1su_12_38"> <sup>38</sup>All these men of war, who could keep ranks, came to Hebron with a loyal heart, to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest of Israel <i>were</i> of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:12">⚓</a>one mind to make David king. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_39"><sup>39</sup>And they were there with David three days, eating and drinking, for their brethren had prepared for them. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_12_40"><sup>40</sup>Moreover those who were near to them, from as far away as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, were bringing food on donkeys and camels, on mules and oxen—provisions of flour and cakes of figs and cakes of raisins, wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly, for <i>there</i> <i>was</i> joy in Israel.<br/></span>
