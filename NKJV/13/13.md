<div class="title"><h1>13</h1><h3>The Ark Brought from Kirjath Jearim</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1su_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then David consulted with the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 11:15; 12:34">⚓</a>captains of thousands and hundreds, <i>and</i> with every leader. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_13_2"><sup>2</sup>And David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If <i>it</i> <i>seems</i> good to you, and if it is of the Lord our God, let us send out to our brethren everywhere <i>who</i> <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:1; Is. 37:4">⚓</a>left in all the land of Israel, and with them to the priests and Levites <i>who</i> <i>are</i> in their cities <i>and</i> their common-lands, that they may gather together to us; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_13_3"><sup>3</sup>and let us bring the ark of our God back to us, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:1, 2">⚓</a>for we have not inquired at it since the days of Saul.” </span>
<span class="verse 1su_13_4"><sup>4</sup>Then all the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_13_5"> <sup>5</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:5">⚓</a>David gathered all Israel together, from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 13:3">⚓</a>Shihor in Egypt to as far as the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 6:21; 7:1, 2">⚓</a>from Kirjath Jearim. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_13_6"><sup>6</sup>And David and all Israel went up to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:9, 60">⚓</a>Baalah, to Kirjath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:22; 1 Sam. 4:4; 2 Kin. 19:15">⚓</a>who dwells <i>between</i> the cherubim, where <i>His</i> name is proclaimed. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_13_7"><sup>7</sup>So they carried the ark of God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 4:15; 1 Sam. 6:7">⚓</a>on a new cart <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:1">⚓</a>from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_13_8"><sup>8</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:5">⚓</a>David and all Israel played <i>music</i> before God with all <i>their</i> might, with singing, on harps, on stringed instruments, on tambourines, on cymbals, and with trumpets.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_13_9"> <sup>9</sup>And when they came to Chidon’s threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_13_10"><sup>10</sup>Then the anger of the Lord was aroused against Uzza, and He struck him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Num. 4:15); 1 Chr. 15:13, 15">⚓</a>because he put his hand to the ark; and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 10:2">⚓</a>died there before God. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_13_11"><sup>11</sup>And David became angry because of the Lord’s outbreak against Uzza; therefore that place is called Perez Uzza to this day. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_13_12"><sup>12</sup>David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How can I bring the ark of God to me?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_13_13"> <sup>13</sup>So David would not move the ark with him into the City of David, but took it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_13_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:11">⚓</a>The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And the Lord blessed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 30:27); 1 Chr. 26:4–8">⚓</a>the house of Obed-Edom and all that he had.<br/></span>
