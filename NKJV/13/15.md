<span class="verse 1su_15_1"> <sup>1</sup><i>David</i> built houses for himself in the City of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 16:1">⚓</a>and pitched a tent for it. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_2"><sup>2</sup>Then David said, “No one may carry the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Num. 4:15); 2 Sam. 6:1–11">⚓</a>ark of God but the Levites, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 4:2–15; Deut. 10:8; 31:9">⚓</a>the Lord has chosen them to carry the ark of God and to minister before Him forever.” </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_3"><sup>3</sup>And David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 40:20, 21; 2 Sam. 6:12; 1 Kin. 8:1; 1 Chr. 13:5">⚓</a>gathered all Israel together at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord to its place, which he had prepared for it. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_4"><sup>4</sup>Then David assembled the children of Aaron and the Levites: </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_5"><sup>5</sup>of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and one hundred and twenty of his brethren; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_6"><sup>6</sup>of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and two hundred and twenty of his brethren; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_7"><sup>7</sup>of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and one hundred and thirty of his brethren; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_8"><sup>8</sup>of the sons of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:22">⚓</a>Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and two hundred of his brethren; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_9"><sup>9</sup>of the sons of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:18">⚓</a>Hebron, Eliel the chief, and eighty of his brethren; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_10"><sup>10</sup>of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and one hundred and twelve of his brethren.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_11"> <sup>11</sup>And David called for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:17; 15:24–29, 35, 36; 18:19, 22, 27; 19:11; 20:25; 1 Chr. 12:28">⚓</a>Zadok and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 22:20–23; 23:6; 30:7; 1 Kin. 2:22, 26, 27; Mark 2:6">⚓</a>Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites: for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_12"><sup>12</sup>He said to them, “You <i>are</i> the heads of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel to <i>the</i> <i>place</i> I have prepared for it. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_13"><sup>13</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:3">⚓</a>because you <i>did</i> not <i>do</i> <i>it</i> the first <i>time,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 13:7–11">⚓</a>the Lord our God broke out against us, because we did not consult Him about the proper order.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_14"> <sup>14</sup>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_15"><sup>15</sup>And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders, by its poles, as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:14; Num. 4:15; 7:9">⚓</a>Moses had commanded according to the word of the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then David spoke to the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brethren <i>to</i> <i>be</i> the singers accompanied by instruments of music, stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals, by raising the voice with resounding joy. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_17"><sup>17</sup>So the Levites appointed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 6:33; 25:1">⚓</a>Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 6:39">⚓</a>Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of their brethren, the sons of Merari, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 6:44">⚓</a>Ethan the son of Kushaiah; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_18"><sup>18</sup>and with them their brethren of the second <i>rank:</i> Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_19"><sup>19</sup>the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <i>were</i> to sound the cymbals of bronze; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_20"><sup>20</sup>Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with strings according to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 46:title">⚓</a>Alamoth; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_21"><sup>21</sup>Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, to direct with harps on the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 6:title">⚓</a>Sheminith; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_22"><sup>22</sup>Chenaniah, leader of the Levites, was instructor <i>in</i> <i>charge</i> <i>of</i> the music, because he <i>was</i> skillful; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_23"><sup>23</sup>Berechiah and Elkanah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_24"><sup>24</sup>Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Num. 10:8); Ps. 81:3">⚓</a>were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 13:13, 14">⚓</a>Obed-Edom and Jehiah, doorkeepers for the ark.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_25"> <sup>25</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:12, 13; 1 Kin. 8:1">⚓</a>David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the house of Obed-Edom with joy. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_26"><sup>26</sup>And so it was, when God helped the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they offered seven bulls and seven rams. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_27"><sup>27</sup>David was clothed with a robe of fine <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:18, 28">⚓</a>linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the music master <i>with</i> the singers. David also wore a linen ephod. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_28"><sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:21; Josh. 6:20; 1 Chr. 13:8; Zech. 4:7; 1 Thess. 4:16">⚓</a>Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the horn, with trumpets and with cymbals, making music with stringed instruments and harps.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_15_29"> <sup>29</sup>And it happened, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 18:20, 27; 19:11–17; 2 Sam. 3:13, 14; 6:16, 20–23">⚓</a><i>as</i> the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the City of David, that Michal, Saul’s daughter, looked through a window and saw King David whirling and playing music; and she despised him in her heart.<br/></span>
