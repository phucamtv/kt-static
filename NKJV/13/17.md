<div class="title"><h1>17</h1><h3>God’s Covenant with David</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1su_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:1; 1 Chr. 14:1">⚓</a>it came to pass, when David was dwelling in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord<i>is</i> under tent curtains.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_2"> <sup>2</sup>Then Nathan said to David, “Do all that <i>is</i> in your heart, for God <i>is</i> with you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_3"> <sup>3</sup>But it happened that night that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_4"><sup>4</sup>“Go and tell My servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord: “You shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Chr. 28:2, 3)">⚓</a>not build Me a house to dwell in. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_5"><sup>5</sup>For I have not dwelt in a house since the time that I brought up Israel, even to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from <i>one</i> tabernacle <i>to</i> <i>another.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_6"><sup>6</sup>Wherever I have moved about with all Israel, have I ever spoken a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar–’ ” ’ </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_7"><sup>7</sup>Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts: “I took you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:11–13">⚓</a>from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_8"><sup>8</sup>And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a name like the name of the great men who <i>are</i> on the earth. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_9"><sup>9</sup>Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 30:1–9; Jer. 16:14–16; 23:5–8; 24:6; Ezek. 37:21–27); Amos 9:14">⚓</a>plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more; nor shall the sons of wickedness oppress them anymore, as previously, </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_10"><sup>10</sup>since the time that I commanded judges <i>to</i> <i>be</i> over My people Israel. Also I will subdue all your enemies. Furthermore I tell you that the Lord will build you a house. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_11"><sup>11</sup>And it shall be, when your days are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:10; 1 Chr. 29:28">⚓</a>fulfilled, when you must go <i>to</i> <i>be</i> with your fathers, that I will set up your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:5; 6:12; 8:19–21; (1 Chr. 22:9–13; 28:20); Matt. 1:6; Luke 3:31">⚓</a>seed after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:38; 2 Chr. 6:2; (Ps. 89:20–37)">⚓</a>He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:14, 15; Matt. 3:17; Mark 1:11; Luke 3:22; 2 Cor. 6:18; Heb. 1:5">⚓</a>I will be his Father, and he shall be My son; and I will not take My mercy away from him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Sam. 15:23–28); 1 Chr. 10:14">⚓</a>as I took <i>it</i> from <i>him</i> who was before you. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_14"><sup>14</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 89:3, 4; Matt. 19:28; 25:31; (Luke 1:31–33)">⚓</a>I will establish him in My house and in My kingdom forever; and his throne shall be established forever.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_15"> <sup>15</sup>According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:18">⚓</a>Then King David went in and sat before the Lord; and he said: “Who <i>am</i> I, O Lord God? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far? </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_17"><sup>17</sup>And <i>yet</i> this was a small thing in Your sight, O God; and You have <i>also</i> spoken of Your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the rank of a man of high degree, O Lord God. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_18"><sup>18</sup>What more can David <i>say</i> to You for the honor of Your servant? For You know Your servant. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_19"><sup>19</sup>O Lord, for Your servant’s sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all this greatness, in making known all these great things. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_20"><sup>20</sup>O Lord, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> none like You, nor <i>is</i> <i>there</i> <i>any</i> God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 4:6–8, 33–38); Ps. 147:20">⚓</a>And who <i>is</i> like Your people Israel, the one nation on the earth whom God went to redeem for Himself <i>as</i> a people—to make for Yourself a name by great and awesome deeds, by driving out nations from before Your people whom You redeemed from Egypt? </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_22"><sup>22</sup>For You have made Your people Israel Your very own people forever; and You, Lord, have become their God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_23"> <sup>23</sup>“And now, O Lord, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, <i>let</i> <i>it</i> be established forever, and do as You have said. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_24"><sup>24</sup>So let it be established, that Your name may be magnified forever, saying, ‘The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, <i>is</i> Israel’s God.’ And let the house of Your servant David be established before You. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_25"><sup>25</sup>For You, O my God, have revealed to Your servant that You will build him a house. Therefore Your servant has found it <i>in</i> <i>his</i> <i>heart</i> to pray before You. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_26"><sup>26</sup>And now, Lord, You are God, and have promised this goodness to Your servant. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_17_27"><sup>27</sup>Now You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue before You forever; for You have blessed it, O Lord, and <i>it</i> <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> blessed forever.”<br/></span>
