<span class="verse 1su_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>It<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 11:1">⚓</a> happened in the spring of the year, at the time kings go out <i>to</i> <i>battle,</i> that Joab led out the armed forces and ravaged the country of the people of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 11:2—12:25">⚓</a>David stayed at Jerusalem. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:26">⚓</a>Joab defeated Rabbah and overthrew it. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_20_2"><sup>2</sup>Then David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:30, 31">⚓</a>took their king’s crown from his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and <i>there</i> <i>were</i> precious stones in it. And it was set on David’s head. Also he brought out the spoil of the city in great abundance. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_20_3"><sup>3</sup>And he brought out the people who <i>were</i> in it, and put <i>them</i> to work with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. So David did to all the cities of the people of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned <i>to</i> Jerusalem.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Philistine Giants Destroyed</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1su_20_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now it happened afterward <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 21:18">⚓</a>that war broke out at Gezer with the Philistines, at which time <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 11:29">⚓</a>Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai, <i>who</i> <i>was</i> <i>one</i> of the sons of the giant.

<span class="verse 1su_20_5"> <sup>5</sup>Again there was war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear <i>was</i> like a weaver’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:7; 1 Chr. 11:23">⚓</a>beam.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_20_6"> <sup>6</sup>Yet again <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 5:8; 2 Sam. 21:20">⚓</a>there was war at Gath, where there was a man of <i>great</i> stature, with twenty-four fingers and toes, six <i>on</i> <i>each</i> <i>hand</i> and six <i>on</i> <i>each</i> <i>foot;</i> and he also was born to the giant. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_20_7"><sup>7</sup>So when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_20_8"> <sup>8</sup>These were born to the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.<br/></span>
