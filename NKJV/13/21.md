<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>The Census of Israel and Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1su_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:1–25; Job 1:6">⚓</a>Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_2"><sup>2</sup>So David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people, “Go, number Israel from Beersheba to Dan, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 27:23, 24">⚓</a>and bring the number of them to me that I may know <i>it.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_3"> <sup>3</sup>And Joab answered, “May the Lord make His people a hundred times more than they are. But, my lord the king, <i>are</i> they not all my lord’s servants? Why then does my lord require this thing? Why should he be a cause of guilt in Israel?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_4"> <sup>4</sup>Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_5"><sup>5</sup>Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. All Israel <i>had</i> one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Judah <i>had</i> four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew the sword. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 27:24">⚓</a>But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_7"> <sup>7</sup>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore He struck Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_8"><sup>8</sup>So David said to God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:10">⚓</a>“I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:13">⚓</a>but now, I pray, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then the Lord spoke to Gad, David’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:9; 2 Kin. 17:13; 1 Chr. 29:29; 2 Chr. 16:7, 10; Is. 30:9, 10; Amos 7:12, 13">⚓</a>seer, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_10"><sup>10</sup>“Go and tell David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:12–14">⚓</a>saying, ‘Thus says the Lord: “I offer you three <i>things;</i> choose one of them for yourself, that I may do <i>it</i> to you.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_11"> <sup>11</sup>So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the Lord: ‘Choose for yourself, </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:13">⚓</a>either three years of famine, or three months to be defeated by your foes with the sword of your enemies overtaking <i>you,</i> or else for three days the sword of the Lord—the plague in the land, with the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.’ Now consider what answer I should take back to Him who sent me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_13"> <sup>13</sup>And David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Please let me fall into the hand of the Lord, for His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 51:1; 130:4, 7">⚓</a>mercies <i>are</i> very great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_14"> <sup>14</sup>So the Lord sent a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 27:24">⚓</a>plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_15"><sup>15</sup>And God sent an <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:16">⚓</a>angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was destroying, the Lord looked and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 6:6">⚓</a>relented of the disaster, and said to the angel who was destroying, “It is enough; now restrain your hand.” And the angel of the Lord stood by the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 3:1">⚓</a>threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then David lifted his eyes and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:13; 2 Chr. 3:1">⚓</a>saw the angel of the Lord standing between earth and heaven, having in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. So David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_17"><sup>17</sup>And David said to God, “Was it not I who commanded the people to be numbered? I am the one who has sinned and done evil indeed; but these <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:8; Ps. 74:1">⚓</a>sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand, I pray, O Lord my God, be against me and my father’s house, but not against Your people that they should be plagued.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_18"> <sup>18</sup>Therefore, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 21:11, 12; 2 Chr. 3:1">⚓</a>angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David that David should go and erect an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_19"><sup>19</sup>So David went up at the word of Gad, which he had spoken in the name of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_20"><sup>20</sup>Now Ornan turned and saw the angel; and his four sons <i>who</i> <i>were</i> with him hid themselves, but Ornan continued threshing wheat. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_21"><sup>21</sup>So David came to Ornan, and Ornan looked and saw David. And he went out from the threshing floor, and bowed before David with <i>his</i> face to the ground. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_22"><sup>22</sup>Then David said to Ornan, “Grant me the place of <i>this</i> threshing floor, that I may build an altar on it to the Lord. You shall grant it to me at the full price, that the plague may be withdrawn from the people.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_23"> <sup>23</sup>But Ornan said to David, “Take <i>it</i> to yourself, and let my lord the king do <i>what</i> <i>is</i> good in his eyes. Look, I <i>also</i> give <i>you</i> the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing implements for wood, and the wheat for the grain offering; I give <i>it</i> all.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will surely buy <i>it</i> for the full price, for I will not take what is yours for the Lord, nor offer burnt offerings with <i>that</i> <i>which</i> costs <i>me</i> nothing.” </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_25"><sup>25</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:24">⚓</a>David gave Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_26"><sup>26</sup>And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on the Lord; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 9:24; Judg. 6:21; 1 Kin. 18:36–38; 2 Chr. 3:1; 7:1">⚓</a>He answered him from heaven by fire on the altar of burnt offering.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_27"> <sup>27</sup>So the Lord commanded the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_28"> <sup>28</sup>At that time, when David saw that the Lord had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_29"><sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:4; 2 Chr. 1:3">⚓</a>For the tabernacle of the Lord and the altar of the burnt offering, which Moses had made in the wilderness, <i>were</i> at that time at the high place in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 16:39">⚓</a>Gibeon. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_21_30"><sup>30</sup>But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the Lord.<br/></span>
