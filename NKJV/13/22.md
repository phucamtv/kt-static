<span class="verse 1su_22_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then David said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:5; 2 Sam. 24:18; 1 Chr. 21:18, 19, 26, 28; 2 Chr. 3:1">⚓</a>“This <i>is</i> the house of the Lord God, and this <i>is</i> the altar of burnt offering for Israel.” </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_2"><sup>2</sup>So David commanded to gather the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:20, 21; 2 Chr. 2:17, 18">⚓</a>aliens who <i>were</i> in the land of Israel; and he appointed masons to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:17, 18">⚓</a>cut hewn stones to build the house of God. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_3"><sup>3</sup>And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails of the doors of the gates and for the joints, and bronze in abundance <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:47; 1 Chr. 22:14">⚓</a>beyond measure, </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_4"><sup>4</sup>and cedar trees in abundance; for the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:6–10">⚓</a>Sidonians and those from Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now David said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:7; 1 Chr. 29:1, 2">⚓</a>“Solomon my son <i>is</i> young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the Lord<i>must</i> <i>be</i> exceedingly magnificent, famous and glorious throughout all countries. I will now make preparation for it.” So David made abundant preparations before his death.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then he called for his son Solomon, and charged him to build a house for the Lord God of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_7"><sup>7</sup>And David said to Solomon: “My son, as for me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:1, 2; 1 Kin. 8:17; 1 Chr. 17:1; 28:2">⚓</a>it was in my mind to build a house <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:5, 11">⚓</a>to the name of the Lord my God; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_8"><sup>8</sup>but the word of the Lord came to me, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:5–13; 1 Kin. 5:3; 1 Chr. 28:3">⚓</a>‘You have shed much blood and have made great wars; you shall not build a house for My name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 28:5">⚓</a>Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 4:20, 25; 5:4">⚓</a>rest from all his enemies all around. His name shall be Solomon, for I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:13; 1 Kin. 5:5; 6:38; 1 Chr. 17:12, 13; 28:6; 2 Chr. 6:2">⚓</a>He shall build a house for My name, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 1:5">⚓</a>he shall be My son, and I <i>will</i> <i>be</i> his Father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’ </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_11"><sup>11</sup>Now, my son, may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 22:16">⚓</a>the Lord be with you; and may you prosper, and build the house of the Lord your God, as He has said to you. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_12"><sup>12</sup>Only may the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:9–12; 2 Chr. 1:10">⚓</a>give you wisdom and understanding, and give you charge concerning Israel, that you may keep the law of the Lord your God. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Josh. 1:7, 8); 1 Chr. 28:7">⚓</a>Then you will prosper, if you take care to fulfill the statutes and judgments with which the Lord charged Moses concerning Israel. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 31:7, 8; Josh. 1:6, 7, 9; 1 Chr. 28:20)">⚓</a>Be strong and of good courage; do not fear nor be dismayed. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_14"><sup>14</sup>Indeed I have taken much trouble to prepare for the house of the Lord one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 22:3">⚓</a>beyond measure, for it is so abundant. I have prepared timber and stone also, and you may add to them. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_15"><sup>15</sup>Moreover <i>there</i> <i>are</i> workmen with you in abundance: woodsmen and stonecutters, and all types of skillful men for every kind of work. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_16"><sup>16</sup>Of gold and silver and bronze and iron <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no limit. Arise and begin working, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 22:11">⚓</a>the Lord be with you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_17"> <sup>17</sup>David also commanded all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 28:1–6">⚓</a>leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, <i>saying,</i></span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_18"><sup>18</sup>“<i>Is</i> not the Lord your God with you? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:10; Josh. 22:4; 2 Sam. 7:1; (1 Kin. 5:4; 8:56)">⚓</a>And has He <i>not</i> given you rest on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land is subdued before the Lord and before His people. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_22_19"><sup>19</sup>Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God. Therefore arise and build the sanctuary of the Lord God, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:1–11; 2 Chr. 5:2–14">⚓</a>bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord and the holy articles of God into the house that is to be built <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:3">⚓</a>for the name of the Lord.”<br/></span>
