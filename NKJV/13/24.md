<span class="verse 1su_24_5"><sup>5</sup>Thus they were divided by lot, one group as another, for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>house</i> of God, from the sons of Eleazar and from the sons of Ithamar. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_24_6"><sup>6</sup>And the scribe, Shemaiah the son of Nethanel, <i>one</i> <i>of</i> the Levites, wrote them down before the king, the leaders, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> of the priests and Levites, one father’s house taken for Eleazar and <i>one</i> for Ithamar.<br/></span>
