<span class="verse 1su_28_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now David assembled at Jerusalem all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 27:16">⚓</a>the leaders of Israel: the officers of the tribes and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 27:1, 2">⚓</a>the captains of the divisions who served the king, the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 27:25">⚓</a>the stewards over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officials, the valiant men, and all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 23:8–39; 1 Chr. 11:10–47">⚓</a>the mighty men of valor.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_28_2"> <sup>2</sup>Then King David rose to his feet and said, “Hear me, my brethren and my people: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:2">⚓</a>I <i>had</i> it in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 99:5; 132:7; (Is. 66:1)">⚓</a>the footstool of our God, and had made preparations to build it. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_28_3"><sup>3</sup>But God said to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:5, 13; 1 Kin. 5:3">⚓</a>‘You shall not build a house for My name, because you <i>have</i> <i>been</i> a man of war and have shed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Chr. 17:4; 22:8)">⚓</a>blood.’ </span>
<span class="verse 1su_28_4"><sup>4</sup>However the Lord God of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:6–13">⚓</a>chose me above all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever, for He has chosen <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:8–10; 1 Chr. 5:2; Ps. 60:7">⚓</a>Judah <i>to</i> <i>be</i> the ruler.

<span class="verse 1su_28_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 3:1–9; 14:3–7; 23:1">⚓</a>And of all my sons (for the Lord has given me many sons) <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 22:9; 29:1">⚓</a>He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_28_6"><sup>6</sup>Now He said to me, ‘It is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:13, 14; 1 Kin. 6:38; 1 Chr. 22:9, 10; 2 Chr. 1:9; 6:2">⚓</a>your son Solomon <i>who</i> shall build My house and My courts; for I have chosen him <i>to</i> <i>be</i> My son, and I will be his Father. </span>

<span class="verse 1su_28_8"><sup>8</sup>Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the Lord, and in the hearing of our God, be careful to seek out all the commandments of the Lord your God, that you may possess this good land, and leave <i>it</i> as an inheritance for your children after you forever.<br/></span>
