<span class="verse 1su_29_1"> <sup>1</sup>Furthermore King David said to all the assembly: “My son Solomon, whom alone God has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 28:5">⚓</a>chosen, <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:7; 1 Chr. 22:5; Prov. 4:3">⚓</a>young and inexperienced; and the work <i>is</i> great, because the temple <i>is</i> not for man but for the Lord God. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_2"><sup>2</sup>Now for the house of my God I have prepared with all my might: gold for <i>things</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>made</i> <i>of</i> gold, silver for <i>things</i> <i>of</i> silver, bronze for <i>things</i> <i>of</i> bronze, iron for <i>things</i> <i>of</i> iron, wood for <i>things</i> <i>of</i> wood, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 54:11, 12; Rev. 21:18">⚓</a>onyx stones, <i>stones</i> to be set, glistening stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and marble slabs in abundance. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_3"><sup>3</sup>Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, my own special treasure of gold and silver: </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_4"><sup>4</sup>three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:28">⚓</a>Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses; </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_5"><sup>5</sup>the gold for <i>things</i> <i>of</i> gold and the silver for <i>things</i> <i>of</i> silver, and for all kinds of work <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>done</i> by the hands of craftsmen. Who <i>then</i> is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:31; (2 Cor. 8:5, 12)">⚓</a>willing to consecrate himself this day to the Lord?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 27:1; 28:1">⚓</a>the leaders of the fathers’ <i>houses,</i> leaders of the tribes of Israel, the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 27:25–31">⚓</a>the officers over the king’s work, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 35:21–35">⚓</a>offered willingly. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_7"><sup>7</sup>They gave for the work of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_8"><sup>8</sup>And whoever had <i>precious</i> stones gave <i>them</i> to the treasury of the house of the Lord, into the hand of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23:8">⚓</a>Jehiel the Gershonite. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_9"><sup>9</sup>Then the people rejoiced, for they had offered willingly, because with a loyal heart they had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:2; 1 Kin. 8:61; 2 Cor. 9:7">⚓</a>offered willingly to the Lord; and King David also rejoiced greatly.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David’s Praise to God</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1su_29_10"> <sup>10</sup>Therefore David blessed the Lord before all the assembly; and David said:<br/>  “Blessed are You, Lord God of Israel, our Father, forever and ever.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_11">   <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 6:13; 1 Tim. 1:17; Rev. 5:13">⚓</a>Yours, O Lord, <i>is</i> the greatness,<br/>   The power and the glory,<br/>   The victory and the majesty;<br/>   For all <i>that</i> <i>is</i> in heaven and in earth <i>is</i> <i>Yours;</i><br/>   Yours <i>is</i> the kingdom, O Lord,<br/>   And You are exalted as head over all.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_12">   <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 11:36">⚓</a>Both riches and honor <i>come</i> from You,<br/>   And You reign over all.<br/>   In Your hand <i>is</i> power and might;<br/>   In Your hand <i>it</i> <i>is</i> to make great<br/>   And to give strength to all.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_13">  <sup>13</sup>“Now therefore, our God,<br/>   We thank You<br/>   And praise Your glorious name.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_14">   <sup>14</sup>But who <i>am</i> I, and who <i>are</i> my people,<br/>   That we should be able to offer so willingly as this?<br/>   For all things <i>come</i> from You,<br/>   And of Your own we have given You.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_15">   <sup>15</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 25:23; Ps. 39:12; Heb. 11:13, 14; 1 Pet. 2:11">⚓</a>we <i>are</i> aliens and pilgrims before You,<br/>   As <i>were</i> all our fathers;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 14:2; Ps. 90:9">⚓</a>Our days on earth <i>are</i> as a shadow,<br/>   And without hope.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_16"> <sup>16</sup>“O Lord our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build You a house for Your holy name is from Your hand, and <i>is</i> all Your own. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_17"><sup>17</sup>I know also, my God, that You <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Sam. 16:7; 1 Chr. 28:9)">⚓</a>test the heart and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 11:20">⚓</a>have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these <i>things;</i> and now with joy I have seen Your people, who are present here to offer willingly to You. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_18"><sup>18</sup>O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the intent of the thoughts of the heart of Your people, and fix their heart toward You. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_19"><sup>19</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Chr. 28:9); Ps. 72:1">⚓</a>give my son Solomon a loyal heart to keep Your commandments and Your testimonies and Your statutes, to do all <i>these</i> <i>things,</i> and to build the temple for which <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 29:1, 2">⚓</a>I have made provision.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then David said to all the assembly, “Now bless the Lord your God.” So all the assembly blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and bowed their heads and prostrated themselves before the Lord and the king.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Solomon Anointed King</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1su_29_21"> <sup>21</sup>And they made sacrifices to the Lord and offered burnt offerings to the Lord on the next day: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:62, 63">⚓</a>sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_22"><sup>22</sup>So they ate and drank before the Lord with great gladness on that day. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:32–35, 39; 1 Chr. 23:1">⚓</a>anointed <i>him</i> before the Lord<i>to</i> <i>be</i> the leader, and Zadok <i>to</i> <i>be</i> priest. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_23"><sup>23</sup>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_24"><sup>24</sup>All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 8:2">⚓</a>submitted themselves to King Solomon. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_25"><sup>25</sup>So the Lord exalted Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:13; 2 Chr. 1:12; Eccl. 2:9">⚓</a>bestowed on him <i>such</i> royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Close of David’s Reign</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1su_29_26"> <sup>26</sup>Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:4; 1 Kin. 2:11">⚓</a>And the period that he reigned over Israel <i>was</i> forty years; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:5">⚓</a>seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty-three <i>years</i> he reigned in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_28"><sup>28</sup>So he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:8">⚓</a>died in a good old age, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23:1">⚓</a>full of days and riches and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place. </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_29"><sup>29</sup>Now the acts of King David, first and last, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the book of Samuel the seer, in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, </span>
<span class="verse 1su_29_30"><sup>30</sup>with all his reign and his might, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:21; 4:23, 25">⚓</a>and the events that happened to him, to Israel, and to all the kingdoms of the lands.<br/></span>
