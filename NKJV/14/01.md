<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>Solomon Requests Wisdom</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:46">⚓</a>Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:2">⚓</a>the Lord his God <i>was</i> with him and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 29:25">⚓</a>exalted him exceedingly.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_2"> <sup>2</sup>And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 27:1–34">⚓</a>the captains of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ <i>houses.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that <i>was</i> at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:4; 1 Chr. 16:39; 21:29">⚓</a>Gibeon; for the tabernacle of meeting with God was there, which Moses the servant of the Lord had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25—27; 35:4—36:38">⚓</a>made in the wilderness. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:10–22; 2 Sam. 6:2–17; 1 Chr. 15:25—16:1">⚓</a>But David had brought up the ark of God from Kirjath Jearim to <i>the</i> <i>place</i> David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_5"><sup>5</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 27:1, 2; 38:1, 2">⚓</a>the bronze altar that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 31:2">⚓</a>Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the Lord; Solomon and the assembly sought Him <i>there.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_6"><sup>6</sup>And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the Lord, which <i>was</i> at the tabernacle of meeting, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:4">⚓</a>offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_7"> <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:5–14; 9:2">⚓</a>On that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, “Ask! What shall I give you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_8"> <sup>8</sup>And Solomon said to God: “You have shown great <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 18:50">⚓</a>mercy to David my father, and have made me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 28:5">⚓</a>king in his place. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_9"><sup>9</sup>Now, O Lord God, let Your promise to David my father be established, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:8–16; 1 Kin. 3:7, 8">⚓</a>for You have made me king over a people like the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:16; Num. 23:10">⚓</a>dust of the earth in multitude. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:9">⚓</a>Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:17; Deut. 31:2">⚓</a>go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of Yours?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_11"> <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:11–13">⚓</a>Then God said to Solomon: “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies, nor have you asked long life—but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king— </span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_12"><sup>12</sup>wisdom and knowledge <i>are</i> granted to you; and I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 10:23; 1 Chr. 29:25; 2 Chr. 9:22; Eccl. 2:9">⚓</a>none of the kings have had who <i>were</i> before you, nor shall any after you have the like.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Solomon’s Military and Economic Power</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_1_13"> <sup>13</sup>So Solomon came to Jerusalem from the high place that <i>was</i> at Gibeon, from before the tabernacle of meeting, and reigned over Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 10:26; 2 Chr. 9:25">⚓</a>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 10:27; 2 Chr. 9:27; Job 22:24">⚓</a>Also the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as abundant as the sycamores which <i>are</i> in the lowland. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 10:28; 22:36; 2 Chr. 9:28">⚓</a>And Solomon had horses imported from Egypt and Keveh; the king’s merchants bought them in Keveh at the <i>current</i> price. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_1_17"><sup>17</sup>They also acquired and imported from Egypt a chariot for six hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver, and a horse for one hundred and fifty; thus, through their agents, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.<br/></span>
