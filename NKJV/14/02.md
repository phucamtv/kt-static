<span class="verse 2su_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Solomon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:5">⚓</a>determined to build a temple for the name of the Lord, and a royal house for himself. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:15, 16; 2 Chr. 2:18">⚓</a>Solomon selected seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry <i>stone</i> in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then Solomon sent to Hiram king of Tyre, saying:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 14:1">⚓</a>As you have dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build himself a house to dwell in, <i>so</i> <i>deal</i> <i>with</i> <i>me.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_4">  <sup>4</sup>Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 2:1">⚓</a>I am building a temple for the name of the Lord my God, to dedicate <i>it</i> to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:7">⚓</a>to burn before Him sweet incense, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:30; Lev. 24:8">⚓</a>the continual showbread, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:38–42">⚓</a>the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 28:3, 9–11">⚓</a>Sabbaths, on the New Moons, and on the set feasts of the Lord our God. This <i>is</i> <i>an</i> <i>ordinance</i> forever to Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_5">   <sup>5</sup>And the temple which I build <i>will</i> <i>be</i> great, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 135:5; (1 Cor. 8:5, 6)">⚓</a>our God is greater than all gods. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_6">   <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:27; 2 Chr. 6:18; Is. 66:1">⚓</a>But who is able to build Him a temple, since heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him? Who <i>am</i> I then, that I should build Him a temple, except to burn sacrifice before Him?<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_7">   <sup>7</sup>Therefore send me at once a man skillful to work in gold and silver, in bronze and iron, in purple and crimson and blue, who has skill to engrave with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 22:15">⚓</a>whom David my father provided. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_8">   <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:6">⚓</a>Also send me cedar and cypress and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and indeed my servants <i>will</i> <i>be</i> with your servants, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_9">   <sup>9</sup>to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the temple which I am about to build <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> great and wonderful.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_10">   <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:11">⚓</a>And indeed I will give to your servants, the woodsmen who cut timber, twenty thousand kors of ground wheat, twenty thousand kors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then Hiram king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 10:9; 2 Chr. 9:8">⚓</a>Because the Lord loves His people, He has made you king over them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_12"> <sup>12</sup>Hiram also said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:7">⚓</a>Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord God of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1; 2; Acts 4:24; 14:15; Rev. 10:6">⚓</a>who made heaven and earth, for He has given King David a wise son, endowed with prudence and understanding, who will build a temple for the Lord and a royal house for himself!<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_13">   <sup>13</sup>And now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, Huram my master <i>craftsman</i></span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_14">   <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:13, 14">⚓</a>(the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre), skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple and blue, fine linen and crimson, and to make any engraving and to accomplish any plan which may be given to him, with your skillful men and with the skillful men of my lord David your father.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_15">   <sup>15</sup>Now therefore, the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine which <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 2:10">⚓</a>my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants.</span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_16">   <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:8, 9">⚓</a>And we will cut wood from Lebanon, as much as you need; we will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, and you will carry it up to Jerusalem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:13; 2 Chr. 8:7, 8">⚓</a>Then Solomon numbered all the aliens who <i>were</i> in the land of Israel, after the census in which <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 22:2">⚓</a>David his father had numbered them; and there were found to be one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_2_18"><sup>18</sup>And he made <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 2:2">⚓</a>seventy thousand of them bearers of burdens, eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred overseers to make the people work.<br/></span>
