<span class="verse 2su_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:1">⚓</a>Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:2–14">⚓</a>Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where <i>the</i> <i>Lord</i> had appeared to his father David, at the place that David had prepared on the threshing floor of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 21:18; 22:1">⚓</a>Ornan the Jebusite. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_2"><sup>2</sup>And he began to build on the second <i>day</i> of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_3"> <sup>3</sup>This is the foundation <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:2; 1 Chr. 28:11–19">⚓</a>which Solomon laid for building the house of God: The length <i>was</i> sixty cubits (by cubits according to the former measure) and the width twenty cubits. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_4"><sup>4</sup>And the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:3; 1 Chr. 28:11">⚓</a>vestibule that <i>was</i> in front <i>of</i> the sanctuary was twenty cubits long across the width of the house, and the height <i>was</i> one hundred and twenty. He overlaid the inside with pure gold. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:17">⚓</a>The larger room he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:15; Jer. 22:14">⚓</a>paneled with cypress which he overlaid with fine gold, and he carved palm trees and chainwork on it. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_6"><sup>6</sup>And he decorated the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold <i>was</i> gold from Parvaim. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_7"><sup>7</sup>He also overlaid the house—the beams and doorposts, its walls and doors—with gold; and he carved cherubim on the walls.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_8"> <sup>8</sup>And he made the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 26:33; 1 Kin. 6:16">⚓</a>Most Holy Place. Its length was according to the width of the house, twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits. He overlaid it with six hundred talents of fine gold. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_9"><sup>9</sup>The weight of the nails <i>was</i> fifty shekels of gold; and he overlaid the upper <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 28:11">⚓</a>area with gold. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:18–20; 1 Kin. 6:23–28">⚓</a>In the Most Holy Place he made two cherubim, fashioned by carving, and overlaid them with gold. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_11"><sup>11</sup>The wings of the cherubim <i>were</i> twenty cubits in <i>overall</i> length: one wing <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>one</i> <i>cherub</i> <i>was</i> five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing <i>was</i> five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub; </span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_12"><sup>12</sup><i>one</i> wing of the other cherub <i>was</i> five cubits, touching the wall of the room, and the other wing <i>also</i> <i>was</i> five cubits, touching the wing of the other cherub. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_13"><sup>13</sup>The wings of these cherubim spanned twenty cubits overall. They stood on their feet, and they faced inward. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_14"><sup>14</sup>And he made the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 26:31; Matt. 27:51; Heb. 9:3">⚓</a>veil of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and wove cherubim into it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_15"> <sup>15</sup>Also he made in front of the temple <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:15–20; Jer. 52:21">⚓</a>two pillars thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that <i>was</i> on the top of each of <i>them</i> was five cubits. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_16"><sup>16</sup>He made wreaths of chainwork, as in the inner sanctuary, and put <i>them</i> on top of the pillars; and he made <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:20">⚓</a>one hundred pomegranates, and put <i>them</i> on the wreaths of chainwork. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_3_17"><sup>17</sup>Then he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:21">⚓</a>set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left; he called the name of the one on the right hand Jachin, and the name of the one on the left Boaz.<br/></span>
