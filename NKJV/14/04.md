<span class="verse 2su_4_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:20">⚓</a>four hundred pomegranates for the two networks (two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that <i>were</i> on the pillars); </span>
<span class="verse 2su_4_14"><sup>14</sup>he also made <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:27, 43">⚓</a>carts and the lavers on the carts; </span>
