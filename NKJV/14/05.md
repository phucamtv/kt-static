<span class="verse 2su_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:51">⚓</a>all the work that Solomon had done for the house of the Lord was finished; and Solomon brought in the things which his father David had dedicated: the silver and the gold and all the furnishings. And he put <i>them</i> in the treasuries of the house of God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Ark Brought into the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_5_2"> <sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:1–9; Ps. 47:9">⚓</a>Now Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel, in Jerusalem, that they might bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord up <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:12">⚓</a>from the City of David, which <i>is</i> Zion. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_5_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:2">⚓</a>Therefore all the men of Israel assembled with the king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:34; 2 Chr. 7:8–10">⚓</a>at the feast, which <i>was</i> in the seventh month. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_5_4"><sup>4</sup>So all the elders of Israel came, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 15:2, 15">⚓</a>Levites took up the ark. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_5_5"><sup>5</sup>Then they brought up the ark, the tabernacle of meeting, and all the holy furnishings that <i>were</i> in the tabernacle. The priests and the Levites brought them up. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_5_6"><sup>6</sup>Also King Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled with him before the ark, were sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted or numbered for multitude. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_5_7"><sup>7</sup>Then the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord to its place, into the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 4:20">⚓</a>inner sanctuary of the temple, to the Most Holy <i>Place,</i> under the wings of the cherubim. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_5_8"><sup>8</sup>For the cherubim spread <i>their</i> wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_5_9"><sup>9</sup>The poles extended so that the ends of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:13–15">⚓</a>poles of the ark could be seen from <i>the</i> <i>holy</i> <i>place,</i> in front of the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_5_10"><sup>10</sup>Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets which Moses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:16; Deut. 10:2, 5; 2 Chr. 6:11; Heb. 9:4">⚓</a>put <i>there</i> at Horeb, when the Lord made <i>a</i> <i>covenant</i> with the children of Israel, when they had come out of Egypt.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_5_11"> <sup>11</sup>And it came to pass when the priests came out of the <i>Most</i> Holy <i>Place</i> (for all the priests who <i>were</i> present had sanctified themselves, without keeping to their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 24:1–5">⚓</a>divisions), </span>
<span class="verse 2su_5_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:26; 1 Chr. 25:1–7">⚓</a>and the Levites <i>who</i> <i>were</i> the singers, all those of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, stood at the east end of the altar, clothed in white linen, having cymbals, stringed instruments and harps, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 13:8; 15:16, 24">⚓</a>and with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets— </span>
<span class="verse 2su_5_13"><sup>13</sup>indeed it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers <i>were</i> as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord, and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the Lord, <i>saying:</i><br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 16:34, 41; 2 Chr. 7:3; Ezra 3:11; Ps. 100:5; 106:1; Ps. 136; Jer. 33:11">⚓</a><i>“For He is</i> good,<br/>   For His mercy <i>endures</i> forever,”<br/> that the house, the house of the Lord, was filled with a cloud, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_5_14"><sup>14</sup>so that the priests could not continue ministering because of the cloud; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 40:35; 1 Kin. 8:11; 2 Chr. 7:2; Ezek. 43:5">⚓</a>for the glory of the Lord filled the house of God.<br/></span>
