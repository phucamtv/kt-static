<span class="verse 2su_6_4"><sup>4</sup>And he said: “Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord God of Israel, who has fulfilled with His hands <i>what</i> He spoke with His mouth to my father David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 17:5">⚓</a>saying, </span>

<span class="verse 2su_6_9"><sup>9</sup>Nevertheless you shall not build the temple, but your son who will come from your body, he shall build the temple for My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 28:3–6">⚓</a>name.’ </span>
<span class="verse 2su_6_10"><sup>10</sup>So the Lord has fulfilled His word which He spoke, and I have filled the position of my father David, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:12; 10:9">⚓</a>sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised; and I have built the temple for the name of the Lord God of Israel. </span>
