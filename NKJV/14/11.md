<span class="verse 2su_11_4"><sup>4</sup>‘Thus says the Lord: “You shall not go up or fight against your brethren! Let every man return to his house, for this thing is from Me.” ’ ” Therefore they obeyed the words of the Lord, and turned back from attacking Jeroboam.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Rehoboam Fortifies the Cities</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_11_5"> <sup>5</sup>So Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah. </span>

<span class="verse 2su_11_12"><sup>12</sup>Also in every city <i>he</i> <i>put</i> shields and spears, and made them very strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Priests and Levites Move to Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_11_13"> <sup>13</sup>And from all their territories the priests and the Levites who <i>were</i> in all Israel took their stand with him. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_11_14"><sup>14</sup>For the Levites left <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:2–5">⚓</a>their common-lands and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:28–33; 2 Chr. 13:9">⚓</a>Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them from serving as priests to the Lord. </span>

<span class="verse 2su_11_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 14:7">⚓</a>And after <i>the</i> Levites <i>left,</i> those from all the tribes of Israel, such as set their heart to seek the Lord God of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 15:9, 10; 30:11, 18">⚓</a>came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the Lord God of their fathers. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_11_17"><sup>17</sup>So they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 12:1, 13">⚓</a>strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong for three years, because they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Family of Rehoboam</h3></div>

<span class="verse 2su_11_22"><sup>22</sup>And Rehoboam <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 21:15–17">⚓</a>appointed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 13:1">⚓</a>Abijah the son of Maachah as chief, <i>to</i> <i>be</i> leader among his brothers; for he <i>intended</i> to make him king. </span>
