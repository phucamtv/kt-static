<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>Egypt Attacks Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 11:17">⚓</a>it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:22–24">⚓</a>he forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel along with him. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:40; 14:25">⚓</a>And it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam <i>that</i> Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the Lord, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_3"><sup>3</sup>with twelve hundred chariots, sixty thousand horsemen, and people without number who came with him out of Egypt—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 16:8; Nah. 3:9">⚓</a>the Lubim and the Sukkiim and the Ethiopians. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_4"><sup>4</sup>And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came to Jerusalem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 11:2">⚓</a>Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah, who were gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Thus says the Lord: ‘You have forsaken Me, and therefore I also have left you in the hand of Shishak.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_6"> <sup>6</sup>So the leaders of Israel and the king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(James 4:10)">⚓</a>humbled themselves; and they said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:27; (Dan. 9:14)">⚓</a>“The Lord<i>is</i> righteous.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:28, 29">⚓</a>the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves; <i>therefore</i> I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance. My wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_8"><sup>8</sup>Nevertheless <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 26:13">⚓</a>they will be his servants, that they may distinguish <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 28:47, 48)">⚓</a>My service from the service of the kingdoms of the nations.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:25, 26">⚓</a>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king’s house; he took everything. He also carried away the gold shields which Solomon had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 10:16, 17; 2 Chr. 9:15, 16">⚓</a>made. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_10"><sup>10</sup>Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed <i>them</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:27">⚓</a>to the hands of the captains of the guard, who guarded the doorway of the king’s house. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_11"><sup>11</sup>And whenever the king entered the house of the Lord, the guard would go and bring them out; then they would take them back into the guardroom. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_12"><sup>12</sup>When he humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned from him, so as not to destroy <i>him</i> completely; and things also went well in Judah.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The End of Rehoboam’s Reign</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_12_13"> <sup>13</sup>Thus King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:21">⚓</a>Rehoboam <i>was</i> forty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 6:6">⚓</a>the city which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mother’s name <i>was</i> Naamah, an <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:1, 5">⚓</a>Ammonitess. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_14"><sup>14</sup>And he did evil, because he did not prepare his heart to seek the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_15"> <sup>15</sup>The acts of Rehoboam, first and last, <i>are</i> they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 9:29; 13:22">⚓</a>and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:30">⚓</a>And <i>there</i> <i>were</i> wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_12_16"><sup>16</sup>So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 11:20–22">⚓</a>Abijah his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
