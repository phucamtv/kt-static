<div class="title"><h1>13</h1><h3>Abijah Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>In <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:1">⚓</a>the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:17">⚓</a>Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_2"><sup>2</sup>He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name <i>was</i> Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.<br/> And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_3"><sup>3</sup>Abijah set the battle in order with an army of valiant warriors, four hundred thousand choice men. Jeroboam also drew up in battle formation against him with eight hundred thousand choice men, mighty men of valor.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then Abijah stood on Mount <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:22">⚓</a>Zemaraim, which <i>is</i> in the mountains of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel: </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_5"><sup>5</sup>Should you not know that the Lord God of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:8–16">⚓</a>gave the dominion over Israel to David forever, to him and his sons, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 2:13; Num. 18:19">⚓</a>by a covenant of salt? </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_6"><sup>6</sup>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:28; 12:20">⚓</a>rebelled against his lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_7"><sup>7</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 9:4">⚓</a>worthless rogues gathered to him, and strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 12:13">⚓</a>young and inexperienced and could not withstand them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_8"><sup>8</sup>And now you think to withstand the kingdom of the Lord, which is in the hand of the sons of David; and you <i>are</i> a great multitude, and with you are the gold calves which Jeroboam <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:28; 14:9; 2 Chr. 11:15; (Hos. 8:4–6)">⚓</a>made for you as gods. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 11:13–15">⚓</a>Have you not cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests, like the peoples of <i>other</i> lands, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:29–33">⚓</a>so that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 2:11; 5:7">⚓</a><i>things</i> <i>that</i> <i>are</i> not gods? </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_10"><sup>10</sup>But as for us, the Lord<i>is</i> our <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:15">⚓</a>God, and we have not forsaken Him; and the priests who minister to the Lord<i>are</i> the sons of Aaron, and the Levites <i>attend</i> to <i>their</i> duties. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:38; 2 Chr. 2:4">⚓</a>And they burn to the Lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense; <i>they</i> also <i>set</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:30; Lev. 24:5–9">⚓</a>showbread <i>in</i> <i>order</i> <i>on</i> the pure <i>gold</i> table, and the lampstand of gold with its lamps <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 27:20, 21; Lev. 24:2, 3">⚓</a>to burn every evening; for we keep the command of the Lord our God, but you have forsaken Him. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_12"><sup>12</sup>Now look, God Himself is with us as <i>our</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 5:13–15; (Heb. 2:10)">⚓</a>head, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Num. 10:8–10)">⚓</a>and His priests with sounding trumpets to sound the alarm against you. O children of Israel, do not fight against the Lord God of your fathers, for you shall not prosper!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_13"> <sup>13</sup>But Jeroboam caused an ambush to go around behind them; so they were in front of Judah, and the ambush <i>was</i> behind them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_14"><sup>14</sup>And when Judah looked around, to their surprise the battle line <i>was</i> at both front and rear; and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:7; 2 Chr. 6:34, 35; 14:11">⚓</a>cried out to the Lord, and the priests sounded the trumpets. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_15"><sup>15</sup>Then the men of Judah gave a shout; and as the men of Judah shouted, it happened that God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:14; 2 Chr. 14:12">⚓</a>struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_16"><sup>16</sup>And the children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_17"><sup>17</sup>Then Abijah and his people struck them with a great slaughter; so five hundred thousand choice men of Israel fell slain. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_18"><sup>18</sup>Thus the children of Israel were subdued at that time; and the children of Judah prevailed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 5:20; 2 Chr. 14:11; (Ps. 22:5)">⚓</a>because they relied on the Lord God of their fathers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_19"> <sup>19</sup>And Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:9">⚓</a>Ephrain with its villages. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_20"><sup>20</sup>So Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah; and the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:6; 25:38; Acts 12:23">⚓</a>struck him, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:20">⚓</a>he died.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_21"> <sup>21</sup>But Abijah grew mighty, married fourteen wives, and begot twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_13_22"><sup>22</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings <i>are</i> written in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 9:29">⚓</a>the annals of the prophet Iddo.<br/></span>
