<span class="verse 2su_14_1"> <sup>1</sup>So Abijah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:8">⚓</a>Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet for ten years.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Asa Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_14_2"> <sup>2</sup>Asa did <i>what</i> <i>was</i> good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_14_3"><sup>3</sup>for he removed the altars of the foreign <i>gods</i> and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:14; 2 Chr. 15:17">⚓</a>the high places, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 34:13)">⚓</a>broke down the <i>sacred</i> pillars <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:7">⚓</a>and cut down the wooden images. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_14_4"><sup>4</sup>He commanded Judah to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Chr. 7:14)">⚓</a>seek the Lord God of their fathers, and to observe the law and the commandment. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_14_5"><sup>5</sup>He also removed the high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and the kingdom was quiet under him. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_14_6"><sup>6</sup>And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest; he had no war in those years, because the Lord had given him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 15:15">⚓</a>rest. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_14_7"><sup>7</sup>Therefore he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and make walls around <i>them,</i> and towers, gates, and bars, <i>while</i> the land <i>is</i> yet before us, because we have sought the Lord our God; we have sought <i>Him,</i> and He has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_14_8"><sup>8</sup>And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah who carried shields and spears, and from Benjamin two hundred and eighty thousand men who carried shields and drew <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 12:2">⚓</a>bows; all these <i>were</i> mighty men of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 13:3">⚓</a>valor.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_14_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 12:2, 3; 16:8">⚓</a>Then Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and he came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:44">⚓</a>Mareshah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_14_10"><sup>10</sup>So Asa went out against him, and they set the troops in battle array in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_14_11"><sup>11</sup>And Asa <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:10; 2 Chr. 13:14; (Ps. 22:5)">⚓</a>cried out to the Lord his God, and said, “Lord, <i>it</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Sam. 14:6)">⚓</a>nothing for You to help, whether with many or with those who have no power; help us, O Lord our God, for we rest on You, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:45; (Prov. 18:10)">⚓</a>in Your name we go against this multitude. O Lord, You <i>are</i> our God; do not let man prevail against You!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_14_12"> <sup>12</sup>So the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 13:15">⚓</a>struck the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians fled. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_14_13"><sup>13</sup>And Asa and the people who <i>were</i> with him pursued them to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 10:19; 20:1">⚓</a>Gerar. So the Ethiopians were overthrown, and they could not recover, for they were broken before the Lord and His army. And they carried away very much spoil. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_14_14"><sup>14</sup>Then they defeated all the cities around Gerar, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:5; Deut. 11:25; Josh. 2:9; 2 Chr. 17:10">⚓</a>the fear of the Lord came upon them; and they plundered all the cities, for there was exceedingly much spoil in them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_14_15"><sup>15</sup>They also attacked the livestock enclosures, and carried off sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.<br/></span>
