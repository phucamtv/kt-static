<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>The Reforms of Asa</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 24:2; Judg. 3:10; 2 Chr. 20:14; 24:20">⚓</a>the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_2"><sup>2</sup>And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him: “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(James 4:8)">⚓</a>The Lord<i>is</i> with you while you are with Him. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Chr. 28:9); 2 Chr. 14:4; 33:12, 13; (Jer. 29:13; Matt. 7:7)">⚓</a>If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 24:20">⚓</a>you forsake Him, He will forsake you. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 3:4">⚓</a>For a long time Israel <i>has</i> <i>been</i> without the true God, without a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:2">⚓</a>teaching priest, and without <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 10:11; 2 Chr. 17:8, 9">⚓</a>law; </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_4"><sup>4</sup>but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 4:29)">⚓</a>when in their trouble they turned to the Lord God of Israel, and sought Him, He was found by them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_5"><sup>5</sup>And in those times <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no peace to the one who went out, nor to the one who came in, but great turmoil <i>was</i> on all the inhabitants of the lands. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 24:7">⚓</a>So nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city, for God troubled them with every adversity. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_7"><sup>7</sup>But you, be strong and do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_8"> <sup>8</sup>And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 13:19">⚓</a>which he had taken in the mountains of Ephraim; and he restored the altar of the Lord that <i>was</i> before the vestibule of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_9"><sup>9</sup>Then he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 11:16">⚓</a>those who dwelt with them from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, for they came over to him in great numbers from Israel when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_10"> <sup>10</sup>So they gathered together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 14:13–15">⚓</a>And they offered to the Lord at that time seven hundred bulls and seven thousand sheep from the spoil they had brought. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_12"><sup>12</sup>Then they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:3; 2 Chr. 23:16; 34:31; Neh. 10:29">⚓</a>entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul; </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:20">⚓</a>and whoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:5–15">⚓</a>was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_14"><sup>14</sup>Then they took an oath before the Lord with a loud voice, with shouting and trumpets and rams’ horns. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_15"><sup>15</sup>And all Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 15:2">⚓</a>sought Him with all their soul; and He was found by them, and the Lord gave them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 14:7">⚓</a>rest all around.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_16"> <sup>16</sup>Also he removed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:2, 10, 13">⚓</a>Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, from <i>being</i> queen mother, because she had made an obscene image of Asherah; and Asa cut down her obscene image, then crushed and burned <i>it</i> by the Brook Kidron. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_17"><sup>17</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:14; 2 Chr. 14:3, 5">⚓</a>the high places were not removed from Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was loyal all his days.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_18"> <sup>18</sup>He also brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated: silver and gold and utensils. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_15_19"><sup>19</sup>And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.<br/></span>
