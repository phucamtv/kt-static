<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>Asa’s Treaty with Syria</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:17–22">⚓</a>Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah and built Ramah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 15:9">⚓</a>that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_16_2"><sup>2</sup>Then Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the Lord and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-Hadad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_16_3"><sup>3</sup>“<i>Let</i> <i>there</i> <i>be</i> a treaty between you and me, as there was between my father and your father. See, I have sent you silver and gold; come, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_16_4"> <sup>4</sup>So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_16_5"><sup>5</sup>Now it happened, when Baasha heard <i>it,</i> that he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_16_6"><sup>6</sup>Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Hanani’s Message to Asa</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_16_7"> <sup>7</sup>And at that time <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:1; 2 Chr. 19:2">⚓</a>Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 32:8–10; Ps. 118:9; (Is. 31:1; Jer. 17:5)">⚓</a>“Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on the Lord your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_16_8"><sup>8</sup>Were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 14:9">⚓</a>the Ethiopians and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 12:3">⚓</a>the Lubim not a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you relied on the Lord, He delivered them into your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 13:16, 18">⚓</a>hand. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_16_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 34:21; (Prov. 5:21; 15:3; Jer. 16:17; 32:19); Zech. 4:10">⚓</a>For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of <i>those</i> whose heart <i>is</i> loyal to Him. In this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:13">⚓</a>you have done foolishly; therefore from now on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:32">⚓</a>you shall have wars.” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_16_10"><sup>10</sup>Then Asa was angry with the seer, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 18:26; Jer. 20:2; Matt. 14:3">⚓</a>put him in prison, for <i>he</i> <i>was</i> enraged at him because of this. And Asa oppressed <i>some</i> of the people at that time.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Illness and Death of Asa</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_16_11"> <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:23, 24; 2 Chr. 14:2">⚓</a>Note that the acts of Asa, first and last, are indeed written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_16_12"><sup>12</sup>And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his malady was severe; yet in his disease he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 17:5)">⚓</a>did not seek the Lord, but the physicians.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_16_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:24">⚓</a>So Asa rested with his fathers; he died in the forty-first year of his reign. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_16_14"><sup>14</sup>They buried him in his own tomb, which he had made for himself in the City of David; and they laid him in the bed which was filled <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:2; Mark 16:1; John 19:39, 40">⚓</a>with spices and various ingredients prepared in a mixture of ointments. They made <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:19; Jer. 34:5">⚓</a>a very great burning for him.<br/></span>
