<div class="title"><h1>17</h1><h3>Jehoshaphat Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:24; 2 Chr. 20:31">⚓</a>Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_2"><sup>2</sup>And he placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 11:5">⚓</a>Judah and in the cities of Ephraim <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 15:8">⚓</a>which Asa his father had taken. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_3"><sup>3</sup>Now the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of his father David; he did not seek the Baals, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_4"><sup>4</sup>but sought the God of his father, and walked in His commandments and not according to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:28">⚓</a>the acts of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_5"><sup>5</sup>Therefore the Lord established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:27; 1 Kin. 10:25">⚓</a>gave presents to Jehoshaphat, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 18:1">⚓</a>and he had riches and honor in abundance. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_6"><sup>6</sup>And his heart took delight in the ways of the Lord; moreover <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:43; 2 Chr. 15:17; 19:3; 20:33">⚓</a>he removed the high places and wooden images from Judah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_7"> <sup>7</sup>Also in the third year of his reign he sent his leaders, Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Michaiah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 15:3; 35:3">⚓</a>to teach in the cities of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_8"><sup>8</sup>And with them <i>he</i> <i>sent</i> Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah—the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:4–9; 2 Chr. 35:3; Neh. 8:3, 7">⚓</a>So they taught in Judah, and <i>had</i> the Book of the Law of the Lord with them; they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught the people.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_10"> <sup>10</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:5; 2 Chr. 14:14">⚓</a>the fear of the Lord fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that <i>were</i> around Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_11"><sup>11</sup>Also <i>some</i> of the Philistines <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:2; 2 Chr. 9:14; 26:8">⚓</a>brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver as tribute; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_12"> <sup>12</sup>So Jehoshaphat became increasingly powerful, and he built fortresses and storage cities in Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_13"><sup>13</sup>He had much property in the cities of Judah; and the men of war, mighty men of valor, <i>were</i> in Jerusalem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_14"> <sup>14</sup>These <i>are</i> their numbers, according to their fathers’ houses. Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor; </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_15"><sup>15</sup>and next to him <i>was</i> Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand; </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_16"><sup>16</sup>and next to him <i>was</i> Amasiah the son of Zichri, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:2, 9; 1 Chr. 29:9">⚓</a>who willingly offered himself to the Lord, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_17"><sup>17</sup>Of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand men armed with bow and shield; </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_18"><sup>18</sup>and next to him <i>was</i> Jehozabad, and with him one hundred and eighty thousand prepared for war. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_17_19"><sup>19</sup>These served the king, besides <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 17:2">⚓</a>those the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.<br/></span>
