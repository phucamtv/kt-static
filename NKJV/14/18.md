<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>Micaiah Warns Ahab</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>Jehoshaphat <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 17:5">⚓</a>had riches and honor in abundance; and by marriage he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:44; 2 Kin. 8:18">⚓</a>allied himself with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:40">⚓</a>Ahab. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 23:2); 1 Kin. 22:2">⚓</a>After some years he went down to <i>visit</i> Ahab in Samaria; and Ahab killed sheep and oxen in abundance for him and the people who were with him, and persuaded him to go up <i>with</i> <i>him</i> to Ramoth Gilead. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_3"><sup>3</sup>So Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me <i>against</i> Ramoth Gilead?”<br/> And he answered him, “I <i>am</i> as you <i>are,</i> and my people as your people; <i>we</i> <i>will</i> <i>be</i> with you in the war.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_4"> <sup>4</sup>Also Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 23:2, 4, 9; 2 Sam. 2:1">⚓</a>“Please inquire for the word of the Lord today.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?”<br/> So they said, “Go up, for God will deliver it into the king’s hand.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_6"> <sup>6</sup>But Jehoshaphat said, “<i>Is</i> <i>there</i> not still a prophet of the Lord here, that we may inquire of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 3:11">⚓</a>Him?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_7"> <sup>7</sup>So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “<i>There</i> <i>is</i> still one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord; but I hate him, because he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. He <i>is</i> Micaiah the son of Imla.”<br/> And Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say such things!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then the king of Israel called one <i>of</i> <i>his</i> officers and said, “Bring Micaiah the son of Imla quickly!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_9"> <sup>9</sup>The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, clothed in <i>their</i> robes, sat each on his throne; and they sat at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_10"><sup>10</sup>Now Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 1:18–21">⚓</a>horns of iron for himself; and he said, “Thus says the Lord: ‘With these you shall gore the Syrians until they are destroyed.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_11"> <sup>11</sup>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper, for the Lord will deliver <i>it</i> into the king’s hand.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Now listen, the words of the prophets with one accord encourage the king. Therefore please let your word be like <i>the</i> <i>word</i> <i>of</i> one of them, and speak encouragement.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_13"> <sup>13</sup>And Micaiah said, “<i>As</i> the Lord lives, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:18–20, 35; 23:12, 26; 1 Kin. 22:14">⚓</a>whatever my God says, that I will speak.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then he came to the king; and the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?”<br/> And he said, “Go and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_15"> <sup>15</sup>So the king said to him, “How many times shall I make you swear that you tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then he said, “I saw all Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 23:1–8; 31:10)">⚓</a>scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:17; 1 Kin. 22:17; (Ezek. 34:5–8); Matt. 9:36; Mark 6:34">⚓</a>shepherd. And the Lord said, ‘These have no master. Let each return to his house in peace.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_17"> <sup>17</sup>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then <i>Micaiah</i> said, “Therefore hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 6:1–5; Dan. 7:9, 10">⚓</a>throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right hand and His left. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_19"><sup>19</sup>And the Lord said, ‘Who will persuade Ahab king of Israel to go up, that he may fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ So one spoke in this manner, and another spoke in that manner. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_20"><sup>20</sup>Then a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:6; 2 Thess. 2:9">⚓</a>spirit came forward and stood before the Lord, and said, ‘I will persuade him.’ The Lord said to him, ‘In what way?’ </span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_21"><sup>21</sup>So he said, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And <i>the</i> <i>Lord</i> said, ‘You shall persuade <i>him</i> and also prevail; go out and do so.’ </span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_22"><sup>22</sup>Therefore look! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 12:16, 17; Is. 19:12–14; Ezek. 14:9">⚓</a>The Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours, and the Lord has declared disaster against you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 20:2; Mark 14:65; Acts 23:2">⚓</a>struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did the spirit from the Lord go from me to speak to you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_24"> <sup>24</sup>And Micaiah said, “Indeed you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son; </span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_26"><sup>26</sup>and say, ‘Thus says the king: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 16:10">⚓</a>“Put this <i>fellow</i> in prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction, until I return in peace.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_27"> <sup>27</sup>But Micaiah said, “If you ever return in peace, the Lord has not spoken by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 18:22">⚓</a>me.” And he said, “Take heed, all you people!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ahab Dies in Battle</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_18_28"> <sup>28</sup>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_29"><sup>29</sup>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 35:22">⚓</a>disguise myself and go into battle; but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_30"> <sup>30</sup>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots who <i>were</i> with him, saying, “Fight with no one small or great, but only with the king of Israel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_31"> <sup>31</sup>So it was, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, “It <i>is</i> the king of Israel!” Therefore they surrounded him to attack; but Jehoshaphat <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 13:14, 15">⚓</a>cried out, and the Lord helped him, and God diverted them from him. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_32"><sup>32</sup>For so it was, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_33"><sup>33</sup>Now a certain man drew a bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am wounded.” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_18_34"><sup>34</sup>The battle increased that day, and the king of Israel propped <i>himself</i> up in <i>his</i> chariot facing the Syrians until evening; and about the time of sunset he died.<br/></span>
