<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir Defeated</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>It happened after this <i>that</i> the people of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 18:2">⚓</a>Moab with the people of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 19:15">⚓</a>Ammon, and <i>others</i> with them besides the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 26:7">⚓</a>Ammonites, came to battle against Jehoshaphat. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_2"><sup>2</sup>Then some came and told Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, from Syria; and they are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:7">⚓</a>in Hazazon Tamar” (which <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:62">⚓</a>En Gedi). </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_3"><sup>3</sup>And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 19:3">⚓</a>seek the Lord, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:6; Ezra 8:21; Jer. 36:9; Jon. 3:5">⚓</a>proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_4"><sup>4</sup>So Judah gathered together to ask <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 14:11">⚓</a><i>help</i> from the Lord; and from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, before the new court, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_6"><sup>6</sup>and said: “O Lord God of our fathers, <i>are</i> You not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:39; Josh. 2:11; (1 Kin. 8:23); Matt. 6:9">⚓</a>God in heaven, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:28; 47:2, 8; Dan. 4:17, 25, 32">⚓</a>do You <i>not</i> rule over all the kingdoms of the nations, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 29:12; 2 Chr. 25:8; Ps. 62:11; Matt. 6:13">⚓</a>in Your hand <i>is</i> <i>there</i> <i>not</i> power and might, so that no one is able to withstand You? </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_7"><sup>7</sup><i>Are</i> You not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:14–17; 17:7; Ex. 6:7">⚓</a>our God, <i>who</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 44:2">⚓</a>drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel, and gave it to the descendants of Abraham <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 41:8; James 2:23">⚓</a>Your friend forever? </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_8"><sup>8</sup>And they dwell in it, and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your name, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:33, 37; 2 Chr. 6:28–30">⚓</a>‘If disaster comes upon us—sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine—we will stand before this temple and in Your presence (for Your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 6:20">⚓</a>name <i>is</i> in this temple), and cry out to You in our affliction, and You will hear and save.’ </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_10"><sup>10</sup>And now, here are the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir—whom You <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 2:4, 9, 19">⚓</a>would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:21">⚓</a>they turned from them and did not destroy them— </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_11"><sup>11</sup>here they are, rewarding us <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 83:1–18">⚓</a>by coming to throw us out of Your possession which You have given us to inherit. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_12"><sup>12</sup>O our God, will You not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 11:27; (1 Sam. 3:13)">⚓</a>judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 25:15; 121:1, 2; 123:1, 2; 141:8">⚓</a>our eyes <i>are</i> upon You.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now all Judah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children, stood before the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:25, 26; 24:2; 2 Chr. 15:1; 24:20">⚓</a>the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_15"><sup>15</sup>And he said, “Listen, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the Lord to you: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:13, 14; (Deut. 1:29, 30; 31:6, 8); 2 Chr. 32:7">⚓</a>‘Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 17:47; Zech. 14:3">⚓</a>for the battle <i>is</i> not yours, but God’s. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_16"><sup>16</sup>Tomorrow go down against them. They will surely come up by the Ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of Jeruel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:13, 14">⚓</a>You will not <i>need</i> to fight in this <i>battle.</i> Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, who is with you, O Judah and Jerusalem!’ Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:9; (2 Chr. 15:2; 32:8)">⚓</a>for the Lord<i>is</i> with you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_18"> <sup>18</sup>And Jehoshaphat <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:31; 2 Chr. 7:3; 29:28">⚓</a>bowed his head with <i>his</i> face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem bowed before the Lord, worshiping the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_19"><sup>19</sup>Then the Levites of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with voices loud and high.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_20"> <sup>20</sup>So they rose early in the morning and went out into the Wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Hear me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 7:9">⚓</a>Believe in the Lord your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_21"><sup>21</sup>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing to the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 16:29; Ps. 29:2; 90:17; 96:9; 110:3">⚓</a>and who should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army and were saying:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 16:34; Ps. 106:1; 136:1">⚓</a>“Praise the Lord,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 16:41; 2 Chr. 5:13">⚓</a>For His mercy <i>endures</i> forever.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_22"> <sup>22</sup>Now when they began to sing and to praise, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:22; 1 Sam. 14:20">⚓</a>the Lord set ambushes against the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were defeated. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_23"><sup>23</sup>For the people of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy <i>them.</i> And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:22; 1 Sam. 14:20">⚓</a>they helped to destroy one another.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_24"> <sup>24</sup>So when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and there <i>were</i> their dead bodies, fallen on the earth. No one had escaped.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_25"> <sup>25</sup>When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil, they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies, and precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days gathering the spoil because there was so much. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_26"><sup>26</sup>And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, for there they blessed the Lord; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah until this day. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_27"><sup>27</sup>Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy, for the Lord had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 12:43">⚓</a>made them rejoice over their enemies. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_28"><sup>28</sup>So they came to Jerusalem, with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets, to the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_29"><sup>29</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 14:14; 17:10">⚓</a>the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of <i>those</i> countries when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_30"><sup>30</sup>Then the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:41–43; 2 Chr. 14:6, 7; 15:15; Job 34:29">⚓</a>God gave him rest all around.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The End of Jehoshaphat’s Reign</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_20_31"> <sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Kin. 22:41–43)">⚓</a>So Jehoshaphat was king over Judah. <i>He</i> <i>was</i> thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name <i>was</i> Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_32"><sup>32</sup>And he walked in the way of his father <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 14:2">⚓</a>Asa, and did not turn aside from it, doing <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in the sight of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_33"><sup>33</sup>Nevertheless <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 15:17; 17:6">⚓</a>the high places were not taken away, for as yet the people had not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 12:14; 19:3">⚓</a>directed their hearts to the God of their fathers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_34"> <sup>34</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:1, 7">⚓</a>which <i>is</i> mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_35"> <sup>35</sup>After this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 18:1">⚓</a>Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:48–53">⚓</a>who acted very <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Chr. 19:2)">⚓</a>wickedly. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_36"><sup>36</sup>And he allied himself with him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:26; 10:22">⚓</a>to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion Geber. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_20_37"><sup>37</sup>But Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the Lord has destroyed your works.” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:48">⚓</a>Then the ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 9:21">⚓</a>to Tarshish.<br/></span>
