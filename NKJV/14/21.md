<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>Jehoram Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:50">⚓</a>Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. Then Jehoram his son reigned in his place. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_2"><sup>2</sup>He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azaryahu, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these <i>were</i> the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_3"><sup>3</sup>Their father gave them great gifts of silver and gold and precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he <i>was</i> the firstborn.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now when Jehoram was established over the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself and killed all his brothers with the sword, and also <i>others</i> of the princes of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:17–22">⚓</a>Jehoram <i>was</i> thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_6"><sup>6</sup>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done, for he had the daughter of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 18:1">⚓</a>Ahab as a wife; and he did evil in the sight of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_7"><sup>7</sup>Yet the Lord would not destroy the house of David, because of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:8–17">⚓</a>covenant that He had made with David, and since He had promised to give a lamp to him and to his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:36; 2 Kin. 8:19; Ps. 132:11">⚓</a>sons forever.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_8"> <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 8:20; 14:7, 10; 2 Chr. 25:14, 19">⚓</a>In his days Edom revolted against Judah’s authority, and made a king over themselves. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_9"><sup>9</sup>So Jehoram went out with his officers, and all his chariots with him. And he rose by night and attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the captains of the chariots. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_10"><sup>10</sup>Thus Edom has been in revolt against Judah’s authority to this day. At that time Libnah revolted against his rule, because he had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_11"><sup>11</sup>Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 20:5)">⚓</a>commit harlotry, and led Judah astray.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_12"> <sup>12</sup>And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,<br/>  Thus says the Lord God of your father David:<br/>   Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, or in the ways of Asa king of Judah, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_13">   <sup>13</sup>but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:11">⚓</a>made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 34:15); Deut. 31:16">⚓</a>play the harlot like the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 16:31–33; 2 Kin. 9:22">⚓</a>harlotry of the house of Ahab, and also have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:32; 2 Chr. 21:4">⚓</a>killed your brothers, those of your father’s household, <i>who</i> <i>were</i> better than yourself, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_14">   <sup>14</sup>behold, the Lord will strike your people with a serious affliction—your children, your wives, and all your possessions; </span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_15">   <sup>15</sup>and you <i>will</i> <i>become</i> very sick with a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:18, 19">⚓</a>disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out by reason of the sickness, day by day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_16"> <sup>16</sup>Moreover the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 33:11; (Jer. 51:11)">⚓</a>Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:14, 23">⚓</a>stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 17:11">⚓</a>Arabians who <i>were</i> near the Ethiopians. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_17"><sup>17</sup>And they came up into Judah and invaded it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king’s house, and also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 24:7">⚓</a>his sons and his wives, so that there was not a son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_18"> <sup>18</sup>After all this the Lord struck him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 13:20; 21:15; Acts 12:23">⚓</a>in his intestines with an incurable disease. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_19"><sup>19</sup>Then it happened in the course of time, after the end of two years, that his intestines came out because of his sickness; so he died in severe pain. And his people made no burning for him, like <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 16:14">⚓</a>the burning for his fathers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_21_20"> <sup>20</sup>He was thirty-two years old when he became king. He reigned in Jerusalem eight years and, to no one’s sorrow, departed. However they buried him in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.<br/></span>
