<div class="title"><h1>22</h1><h3>Ahaziah Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_22_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:17; 22:6">⚓</a>Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, for the raiders who came with the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:16">⚓</a>Arabians into the camp had killed all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:17">⚓</a>older <i>sons.</i> So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, reigned. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_22_2"><sup>2</sup>Ahaziah <i>was</i> forty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:6">⚓</a>Athaliah the granddaughter of Omri. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_22_3"><sup>3</sup>He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother advised him to do wickedly. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_22_4"><sup>4</sup>Therefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord, like the house of Ahab; for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_22_5"><sup>5</sup>He also followed their advice, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_22_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:15">⚓</a>Then he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which he had received at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_22_7"> <sup>7</sup>His going to Joram <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 14:4; 1 Kin. 12:15; 2 Chr. 10:15">⚓</a>was God’s occasion for Ahaziah’s downfall; for when he arrived, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:21–24">⚓</a>he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:6, 7">⚓</a>whom the Lord had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_22_8"><sup>8</sup>And it happened, when Jehu was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:22–24">⚓</a>executing judgment on the house of Ahab, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 10:10–14; Hos. 1:4">⚓</a>found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers who served Ahaziah, that he killed them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_22_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Kin. 9:27)">⚓</a>Then he searched for Ahaziah; and they caught him (he was hiding in Samaria), and brought him to Jehu. When they had killed him, they buried him, “because,” they said, “he is the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:24">⚓</a>Jehoshaphat, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 17:4; 20:3, 4">⚓</a>sought the Lord with all his heart.”<br/> So the house of Ahaziah had no one to assume power over the kingdom.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Athaliah Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_22_10"> <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 11:1–3">⚓</a>Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal heirs of the house of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_22_11"><sup>11</sup>But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:18">⚓</a>Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were being murdered, and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah so that she did not kill him. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_22_12"><sup>12</sup>And he was hidden with them in the house of God for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.<br/></span>
