<div class="title"><h1>23</h1><h3>Joash Crowned King of Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_23_1"> <sup>1</sup>In <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 11:4">⚓</a>the seventh year <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:2">⚓</a>Jehoiada strengthened himself, <i>and</i> <i>made</i> <i>a</i> covenant with the captains of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 2:37, 38">⚓</a>Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_2"><sup>2</sup>And they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 1:5">⚓</a>chief fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, “Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as the Lord has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:12; 1 Kin. 2:4; 9:5; 2 Chr. 6:16; 7:18; 21:7">⚓</a>said of the sons of David. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_4"><sup>4</sup>This <i>is</i> what you shall do: One-third of you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 9:25">⚓</a>entering on the Sabbath, of the priests and the Levites, <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> keeping watch over the doors; </span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_5"><sup>5</sup>one-third <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> at the king’s house; and one-third at the Gate of the Foundation. All the people <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> in the courts of the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_6"><sup>6</sup>But let no one come into the house of the Lord except the priests and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23:28–32">⚓</a>those of the Levites who serve. They may go in, for they <i>are</i> holy; but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_7"><sup>7</sup>And the Levites shall surround the king on all sides, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever comes into the house, let him be put to death. You are to be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_8"> <sup>8</sup>So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each man took his men who were to be on duty on the Sabbath, with those who were going <i>off</i> <i>duty</i> on the Sabbath; for Jehoiada the priest had not dismissed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 24:1–31">⚓</a>the divisions. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_9"><sup>9</sup>And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and the large and small <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:7">⚓</a>shields which <i>had</i> <i>belonged</i> to King David, that <i>were</i> in the temple of God. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_10"><sup>10</sup>Then he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and by the temple, all around the king. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_11"><sup>11</sup>And they brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:18">⚓</a><i>gave</i> <i>him</i> the Testimony, and made him king. Then Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, “<i>Long</i> live the king!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Athaliah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_23_12"> <sup>12</sup>Now when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 22:10">⚓</a>Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people <i>in</i> the temple of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_13"><sup>13</sup><i>When</i> she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance; and the leaders and the trumpeters <i>were</i> by the king. All the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, also the singers with musical instruments, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 25:6–8">⚓</a>those who led in praise. So Athaliah tore her clothes and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:23">⚓</a>“Treason! Treason!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_14"> <sup>14</sup>And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Take her outside under guard, and slay with the sword whoever follows her.” For the priest had said, “Do not kill her in the house of the Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_15"> <sup>15</sup>So they seized her; and she went by way of the entrance <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 3:28; Jer. 31:40">⚓</a>of the Horse Gate <i>into</i> the king’s house, and they killed her there.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then Jehoiada made a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:24, 25; 2 Chr. 15:12–15">⚓</a>covenant between himself, the people, and the king, that they should be the Lord’s people. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_17"><sup>17</sup>And all the people went to the temple of Baal, and tore it down. They broke in pieces its altars and images, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:6–9; 1 Kin. 18:40">⚓</a>killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_18"><sup>18</sup>Also Jehoiada appointed the oversight of the house of the Lord to the hand of the priests, the Levites, whom David had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23:6, 30, 31; 24:1">⚓</a>assigned in the house of the Lord, to offer the burnt offerings of the Lord, as <i>it</i> <i>is</i> written in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 28:2">⚓</a>Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, <i>as</i> <i>it</i> <i>was</i> <i>established</i> by David. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_19"><sup>19</sup>And he set the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 26:1–19">⚓</a>gatekeepers at the gates of the house of the Lord, so that no one <i>who</i> <i>was</i> in any way unclean should enter.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:22; 2 Kin. 11:19">⚓</a>Then he took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from the house of the Lord; and they went through the Upper Gate to the king’s house, and set the king on the throne of the kingdom. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_23_21"><sup>21</sup>So all the people of the land rejoiced; and the city was quiet, for they had slain Athaliah with the sword.<br/></span>
