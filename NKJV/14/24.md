<div class="title"><h1>24</h1><h3>Joash Repairs the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_24_1"> <sup>1</sup>Joash <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 11:21; 12:1–15">⚓</a><i>was</i> seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name <i>was</i> Zibiah of Beersheba. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_2"><sup>2</sup>Joash <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 26:4, 5">⚓</a>did <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in the sight of the Lord all the days of Jehoiada the priest. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_3"><sup>3</sup>And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now it happened after this <i>that</i> Joash set his heart on repairing the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_5"><sup>5</sup>Then he gathered the priests and the Levites, and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:4">⚓</a>gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that you do it quickly.”<br/> However the Levites did not do it quickly. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:7">⚓</a>So the king called Jehoiada the chief <i>priest,</i> and said to him, “Why have you not required the Levites to bring in from Judah and from Jerusalem the collection, <i>according</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>commandment</i> of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:12–16">⚓</a>Moses the servant of the Lord and of the assembly of Israel, for the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 1:50; Acts 7:44">⚓</a>tabernacle of witness?” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_7"><sup>7</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:17">⚓</a>the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken into the house of God, and had also presented all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:4">⚓</a>dedicated things of the house of the Lord to the Baals.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then at the king’s command <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:9">⚓</a>they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_9"><sup>9</sup>And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring to the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 24:6">⚓</a>the collection <i>that</i> Moses the servant of God <i>had</i> <i>imposed</i> on Israel in the wilderness. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_10"><sup>10</sup>Then all the leaders and all the people rejoiced, brought their contributions, and put <i>them</i> into the chest until all had given. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_11"><sup>11</sup>So it was, at that time, when the chest was brought to the king’s official by the hand of the Levites, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:10">⚓</a>when they saw that <i>there</i> <i>was</i> much money, that the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it and returned it to its place. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_12"> <sup>12</sup>The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the Lord; and they hired masons and carpenters to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:12">⚓</a>repair the house of the Lord, and also those who worked in iron and bronze to restore the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_13"><sup>13</sup>So the workmen labored, and the work was completed by them; they restored the house of God to its original condition and reinforced it. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_14"><sup>14</sup>When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:13">⚓</a>they made from it articles for the house of the Lord, articles for serving and offering, spoons and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Jehoiada.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Apostasy of Joash</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_24_15"> <sup>15</sup>But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died; <i>he</i> <i>was</i> one hundred and thirty years old when he died. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_16"><sup>16</sup>And they buried him in the City of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and His house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now after the death of Jehoiada the leaders of Judah came and bowed down to the king. And the king listened to them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_18"><sup>18</sup>Therefore they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and served <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:23">⚓</a>wooden images and idols; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 34:12–14); Judg. 5:8; 2 Chr. 19:2; 28:13; 29:8; 32:25">⚓</a>wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of their trespass. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_19"><sup>19</sup>Yet He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:13; 21:10–15; 2 Chr. 36:15, 16; Jer. 7:25, 26; 25:4">⚓</a>sent prophets to them, to bring them back to the Lord; and they testified against them, but they would not listen.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then the Spirit of God came upon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:34; Matt. 23:35">⚓</a>Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said to them, “Thus says God: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:41; (Prov. 28:13)">⚓</a>‘Why do you transgress the commandments of the Lord, so that you cannot prosper? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Chr. 15:2)">⚓</a>Because you have forsaken the Lord, He also has forsaken you.’ ” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_21"><sup>21</sup>So they conspired against him, and at the command of the king they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Neh. 9:26); Matt. 23:35; Acts 7:58, 59">⚓</a>stoned him with stones in the court of the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_22"><sup>22</sup>Thus Joash the king did not remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son; and as he died, he said, “The Lord look on <i>it,</i> and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 9:5)">⚓</a>repay!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Joash</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_24_23"> <sup>23</sup>So it happened in the spring of the year <i>that</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:17; Is. 7:2">⚓</a>the army of Syria came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the leaders of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_24"><sup>24</sup>For the army of the Syrians <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:8; (Deut. 32:30); Is. 30:17">⚓</a>came with a small company of men; but the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:25; (Deut. 28:25)">⚓</a>delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers. So they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 22:8; Is. 10:5">⚓</a>executed judgment against Joash. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_25"><sup>25</sup>And when they had withdrawn from him (for they left him severely wounded), <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:20, 21; 2 Chr. 25:3">⚓</a>his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed. So he died. And they buried him in the City of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_26"> <sup>26</sup>These are the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_24_27"><sup>27</sup>Now <i>concerning</i> his sons, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:18">⚓</a>the many oracles about him, and the repairing of the house of God, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the annals of the book of the kings. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:21">⚓</a>Then Amaziah his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
