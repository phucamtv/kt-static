<div class="title"><h1>25</h1><h3>Amaziah Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_25_1"> <sup>1</sup>Amaziah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:1–6">⚓</a><i>was</i> twenty-five years old <i>when</i> he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name <i>was</i> Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_2"><sup>2</sup>And he did <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in the sight of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:4; 2 Chr. 25:14">⚓</a>but not with a loyal heart.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_3"> <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:5; 2 Chr. 24:25">⚓</a>Now it happened, as soon as the kingdom was established for him, that he executed his servants who had murdered his father the king. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_4"><sup>4</sup>However he did not execute their children, but <i>did</i> as <i>it</i> <i>is</i> written in the Law in the Book of Moses, where the Lord commanded, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 24:16; 2 Kin. 14:6; Jer. 31:30; (Ezek. 18:20)">⚓</a>“The fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall the children be put to death for their fathers; but a person shall die for his own sin.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The War Against Edom</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_25_5"> <sup>5</sup>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, according to <i>their</i> fathers’ houses, throughout all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 1:3">⚓</a>from twenty years old and above, and found them to be three hundred thousand choice <i>men, able</i> to go to war, who could handle spear and shield. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_6"><sup>6</sup>He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_7"><sup>7</sup>But a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 11:2">⚓</a>man of God came to him, saying, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the Lord<i>is</i> not with Israel—<i>not</i> <i>with</i> any of the children of Ephraim. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_8"><sup>8</sup>But if you go, be gone! Be strong in battle! <i>Even</i> <i>so,</i> God shall make you fall before the enemy; for God has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 14:11; 20:6">⚓</a>power to help and to overthrow.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what <i>shall</i> <i>we</i> do about the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel?”<br/> And the man of God answered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 8:18); Prov. 10:22">⚓</a>“The Lord is able to give you much more than this.” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_10"><sup>10</sup>So Amaziah discharged the troops that had come to him from Ephraim, to go back home. Therefore their anger was greatly aroused against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then Amaziah strengthened himself, and leading his people, he went to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:7">⚓</a>the Valley of Salt and killed ten thousand of the people of Seir. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_12"><sup>12</sup>Also the children of Judah took captive ten thousand alive, brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were dashed in pieces.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_13"> <sup>13</sup>But as for the soldiers of the army which Amaziah had discharged, so that they would not go with him to battle, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon, killed three thousand in them, and took much spoil.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_14"> <sup>14</sup>Now it was so, after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 28:23">⚓</a>he brought the gods of the people of Seir, set them up <i>to</i> <i>be</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 20:3, 5)">⚓</a>his gods, and bowed down before them and burned incense to them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_15"><sup>15</sup>Therefore the anger of the Lord was aroused against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, “Why have you sought <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 96:5)">⚓</a>the gods of the people, which <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 25:11">⚓</a>could not rescue their own people from your hand?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_16"> <sup>16</sup>So it was, as he talked with him, that <i>the</i> <i>king</i> said to him, “Have we made you the king’s counselor? Cease! Why should you be killed?”<br/> Then the prophet ceased, and said, “I know that God has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Sam. 2:25)">⚓</a>determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my advice.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel Defeats Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_25_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:8–14">⚓</a>Amaziah king of Judah asked advice and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us face one another <i>in</i> <i>battle.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_18"> <sup>18</sup>And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that <i>was</i> in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife’; and a wild beast that <i>was</i> in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_19"><sup>19</sup>Indeed you say that you have defeated the Edomites, and your heart is lifted up to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 26:16; 32:25; (Prov. 16:18)">⚓</a>boast. Stay at home now; why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall—you and Judah with you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_20"> <sup>20</sup>But Amaziah would not heed, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 12:15; 2 Chr. 22:7">⚓</a>it <i>came</i> from God, that He might give them into the hand <i>of</i> <i>their</i> <i>enemies,</i> because they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 25:14">⚓</a>sought the gods of Edom. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_21"><sup>21</sup>So Joash king of Israel went out; and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced one another at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:38">⚓</a>Beth Shemesh, which <i>belongs</i> to Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_22"><sup>22</sup>And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his tent. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_23"><sup>23</sup>Then Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:17; 22:1, 6">⚓</a>Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh; and he brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate—four hundred cubits. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_24"><sup>24</sup>And <i>he</i> <i>took</i> all the gold and silver, all the articles that were found in the house of God with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 26:15">⚓</a>Obed-Edom, the treasures of the king’s house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Amaziah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_25_25"> <sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:17–22">⚓</a>Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_26"><sup>26</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, indeed <i>are</i> they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_27"><sup>27</sup>After the time that Amaziah turned away from following the Lord, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_25_28"><sup>28</sup>Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the City of Judah.<br/></span>
