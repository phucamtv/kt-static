<div class="title"><h1>26</h1><h3>Uzziah Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_26_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who <i>was</i> sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_2"><sup>2</sup>He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king rested with his fathers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_3"> <sup>3</sup>Uzziah <i>was</i> sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_4"><sup>4</sup>And he did <i>what</i> <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 24:2">⚓</a>right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Amaziah had done. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 24:2">⚓</a>He sought God in the days of Zechariah, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:15; Dan. 1:17; 10:1">⚓</a>had understanding in the visions of God; and as long as he sought the Lord, God made him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Chr. 15:2; 20:20; 31:21)">⚓</a>prosper.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now he went out and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 14:29">⚓</a>made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities <i>around</i> Ashdod and among the Philistines. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_7"><sup>7</sup>God helped him against <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:16">⚓</a>the Philistines, against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and against the Meunites. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_8"><sup>8</sup>Also the Ammonites <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:2; 2 Chr. 17:11">⚓</a>brought tribute to Uzziah. His fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt, for he became exceedingly strong.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_9"> <sup>9</sup>And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:13; 2 Chr. 25:23; Neh. 3:13, 19, 32; Zech. 14:10">⚓</a>Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the corner buttress of the wall; then he fortified them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_10"><sup>10</sup>Also he built towers in the desert. He dug many wells, for he had much livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains; <i>he</i> <i>also</i> <i>had</i> farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Carmel, for he loved the soil.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_11"> <sup>11</sup>Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men who went out to war by companies, according to the number on their roll as prepared by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, <i>one</i> of the king’s captains. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_12"><sup>12</sup>The total number of chief officers of the mighty men of valor <i>was</i> two thousand six hundred. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_13"><sup>13</sup>And under their authority <i>was</i> an army of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_14"><sup>14</sup>Then Uzziah prepared for them, for the entire army, shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and slings <i>to</i> <i>cast</i> stones. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_15"><sup>15</sup>And he made devices in Jerusalem, invented by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 39:3, 8">⚓</a>skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and large stones. So his fame spread far and wide, for he was marvelously helped till he became strong.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Penalty for Uzziah’s Pride</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_26_16"> <sup>16</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 32:15)">⚓</a>when he was strong his heart was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:14; 2 Chr. 25:19">⚓</a>lifted up, to <i>his</i> destruction, for he transgressed against the Lord his God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 13:1–4; 2 Kin. 16:12, 13">⚓</a>by entering the temple of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_17"><sup>17</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 6:10">⚓</a>Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him were eighty priests of the Lord—valiant men. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_18"><sup>18</sup>And they withstood King Uzziah, and said to him, “<i>It</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Num. 3:10; 16:39, 40; 18:7)">⚓</a>is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord, but for the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:7, 8; Heb. 7:14">⚓</a>priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed! You <i>shall</i> <i>have</i> no honor from the Lord God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then Uzziah became furious; and he <i>had</i> a censer in his hand to burn incense. And while he was angry with the priests, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 13:42; Num. 12:10; 2 Kin. 5:25–27">⚓</a>leprosy broke out on his forehead, before the priests in the house of the Lord, beside the incense altar. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_20"><sup>20</sup>And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and there, on his forehead, he <i>was</i> leprous; so they thrust him out of that place. Indeed he also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 6:12">⚓</a>hurried to get out, because the Lord had struck him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:5">⚓</a>King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He dwelt in an <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 13:46; Num. 5:2)">⚓</a>isolated house, because he was a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord. Then Jotham his son <i>was</i> over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_22"> <sup>22</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:1; 2 Chr. 32:20, 32; Is. 1:1">⚓</a>the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz wrote. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_26_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:7; 2 Chr. 21:20; 28:27; Is. 6:1">⚓</a>So Uzziah rested with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which <i>belonged</i> to the kings, for they said, “He is a leper.” Then Jotham his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
