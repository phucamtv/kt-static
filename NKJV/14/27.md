<div class="title"><h1>27</h1><h3>Jotham Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_27_1"> <sup>1</sup>Jotham <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:32–35">⚓</a><i>was</i> twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name <i>was</i> Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_27_2"><sup>2</sup>And he did <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father Uzziah had done (although he did not enter the temple of the Lord). But still <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:35; Ezek. 20:44; 30:13">⚓</a>the people acted corruptly.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_27_3"> <sup>3</sup>He built the Upper Gate of the house of the Lord, and he built extensively on the wall of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 33:14; Neh. 3:26">⚓</a>Ophel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_27_4"><sup>4</sup>Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_27_5"><sup>5</sup>He also fought with the king of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 26:8">⚓</a>Ammonites and defeated them. And the people of Ammon gave him in that year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. The people of Ammon paid this to him in the second and third years also. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_27_6"><sup>6</sup>So Jotham became mighty, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 26:5">⚓</a>because he prepared his ways before the Lord his God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_27_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_27_8"><sup>8</sup>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_27_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:38">⚓</a>So Jotham rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 1:1; Hos. 1:1; Mic. 1:1">⚓</a>Ahaz his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
