<div class="title"><h1>28</h1><h3>Ahaz Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_28_1"> <sup>1</sup>Ahaz <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 16:2–4">⚓</a><i>was</i> twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in the sight of the Lord, as his father David <i>had</i> <i>done.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_2"><sup>2</sup>For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:17; Lev. 19:4">⚓</a>molded images for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:11">⚓</a>the Baals. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_3"><sup>3</sup>He burned incense in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 15:8">⚓</a>the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, and burned <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:10">⚓</a>his children in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 18:21); 2 Kin. 16:3; 2 Chr. 33:6">⚓</a>fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the Lord had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 18:24–30)">⚓</a>cast out before the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_4"><sup>4</sup>And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Syria and Israel Defeat Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_28_5"> <sup>5</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 10:5)">⚓</a>the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria. They <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 16:5, 6; (2 Chr. 24:24); Is. 7:1, 17">⚓</a>defeated him, and carried away a great multitude of them as captives, and brought <i>them</i> to Damascus. Then he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who defeated him with a great slaughter. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_6"><sup>6</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:27">⚓</a>Pekah the son of Remaliah killed one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all valiant men, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Chr. 29:8)">⚓</a>because they had forsaken the Lord God of their fathers. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_7"><sup>7</sup>Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the officer over the house, and Elkanah <i>who</i> <i>was</i> second to the king. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_8"><sup>8</sup>And the children of Israel carried away captive of their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:25, 41; 2 Chr. 11:4">⚓</a>brethren two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters; and they also took away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel Returns the Captives</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_28_9"> <sup>9</sup>But a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 25:15">⚓</a>prophet of the Lord was there, whose name <i>was</i> Oded; and he went out before the army that came to Samaria, and said to them: “Look, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:26; (Is. 10:5; 47:6); Ezek. 25:12, 15; 26:2; Obad. 10; (Zech. 1:15)">⚓</a>because the Lord God of your fathers was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand; but you have killed them in a rage <i>that</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 9:6; Rev. 18:5">⚓</a>reaches up to heaven. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_10"><sup>10</sup>And now you propose to force the children of Judah and Jerusalem to be your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 25:39, 42, 43, 46)">⚓</a>male and female slaves; <i>but</i> <i>are</i> you not also guilty before the Lord your God? </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_11"><sup>11</sup>Now hear me, therefore, and return the captives, whom you have taken captive from your brethren, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:49; James 2:13">⚓</a>for the fierce wrath of the Lord<i>is</i> upon you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_13"><sup>13</sup>and said to them, “You shall not bring the captives here, for we <i>already</i> have offended the Lord. You intend to add to our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and <i>there</i> <i>is</i> fierce wrath against Israel.” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_14"><sup>14</sup>So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the leaders and all the assembly. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_15"><sup>15</sup>Then the men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 28:12">⚓</a>who were designated by name rose up and took the captives, and from the spoil they clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them and gave them sandals, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 25:21, 22; Luke 6:27; Rom. 12:20)">⚓</a>gave them food and drink, and anointed them; and they let all the feeble ones ride on donkeys. So they brought them to their brethren at Jericho, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 34:3; Judg. 1:16">⚓</a>the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Assyria Refuses to Help Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_28_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 16:7">⚓</a>At the same time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_17"><sup>17</sup>For again the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:10; Obad. 10–14">⚓</a>Edomites had come, attacked Judah, and carried away captives. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:16, 17; Ezek. 16:27, 57">⚓</a>The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Sochoh with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages; and they dwelt there. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_19"><sup>19</sup>For the Lord brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 16:2; 2 Chr. 21:2">⚓</a>Israel, for he had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:25">⚓</a>encouraged moral decline in Judah and had been continually unfaithful to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_20"><sup>20</sup>Also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:29; 16:7–9; 1 Chr. 5:26">⚓</a>Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to him and distressed him, and did not assist him. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_21"><sup>21</sup>For Ahaz took part <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>treasures</i> from the house of the Lord, from the house of the king, and from the leaders, and he gave <i>it</i> to the king of Assyria; but he did not help him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Apostasy and Death of Ahaz</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_28_22"> <sup>22</sup>Now in the time of his distress King Ahaz became increasingly unfaithful to the Lord. This <i>is</i> <i>that</i> King Ahaz. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_23"><sup>23</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 25:14">⚓</a>he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him, saying, “Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, I will sacrifice to them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 44:17, 18">⚓</a>that they may help me.” But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_24"><sup>24</sup>So Ahaz gathered the articles of the house of God, cut in pieces the articles of the house of God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:3, 7">⚓</a>shut up the doors of the house of the Lord, and made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_25"><sup>25</sup>And in every single city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger the Lord God of his fathers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_26"> <sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 16:19, 20">⚓</a>Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_28_27"><sup>27</sup>So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem; but they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 21:20; 24:25">⚓</a>did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. Then Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
