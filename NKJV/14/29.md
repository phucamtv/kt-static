<span class="verse 2su_29_1"> <sup>1</sup>Hezekiah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:1; 2 Chr. 32:22, 33">⚓</a>became king <i>when</i> <i>he</i> <i>was</i> twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name <i>was</i> Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_2"><sup>2</sup>And he did <i>what</i> <i>was</i> right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father David had done.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Hezekiah Cleanses the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_29_3"> <sup>3</sup>In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 28:24; 29:7">⚓</a>opened the doors of the house of the Lord and repaired them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_4"><sup>4</sup>Then he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them in the East Square, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_5"><sup>5</sup>and said to them: “Hear me, Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 15:12; 2 Chr. 29:15, 34; 35:6">⚓</a>sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers, and carry out the rubbish from the holy <i>place.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_6"><sup>6</sup>For our fathers have trespassed and done evil in the eyes of the Lord our God; they have forsaken Him, have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 1:4); Jer. 2:27; Ezek. 8:16">⚓</a>turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the Lord, and turned <i>their</i> backs <i>on</i> <i>Him.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 28:24">⚓</a>They have also shut up the doors of the vestibule, put out the lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings in the holy <i>place</i> to the God of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_8"><sup>8</sup>Therefore the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 24:18">⚓</a>wrath of the Lord fell upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 28:5">⚓</a>given them up to trouble, to desolation, and to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:8; Jer. 18:16; 19:8; 25:9, 18; 29:18">⚓</a>jeering, as you see with your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:32">⚓</a>eyes. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_9"><sup>9</sup>For indeed, because of this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:25; 2 Chr. 28:5–8, 17">⚓</a>our fathers have fallen by the sword; and our sons, our daughters, and our wives <i>are</i> in captivity.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_10"> <sup>10</sup>“Now <i>it</i> <i>is</i> in my heart to make <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 15:12; 23:16">⚓</a>a covenant with the Lord God of Israel, that His fierce wrath may turn away from us. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_11"><sup>11</sup>My sons, do not be negligent now, for the Lord has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 3:6; 8:14; 18:2, 6; 2 Chr. 30:16, 17">⚓</a>chosen you to stand before Him, to serve Him, and that you should minister to Him and burn incense.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then these Levites arose: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 31:13">⚓</a>Mahath the son of Amasai and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 3:19, 20">⚓</a>Kohathites; of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah and Eden the son of Joah; </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_13"><sup>13</sup>of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_14"><sup>14</sup>of the sons of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_15"> <sup>15</sup>And they gathered their brethren, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:5">⚓</a>sanctified themselves, and went according to the commandment of the king, at the words of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23:28">⚓</a>to cleanse the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_16"><sup>16</sup>Then the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord to cleanse <i>it,</i> and brought out all the debris that they found in the temple of the Lord to the court of the house of the Lord. And the Levites took <i>it</i> out and carried <i>it</i> to the Brook <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 15:16; 30:14">⚓</a>Kidron.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now they began to sanctify on the first <i>day</i> of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the vestibule of the Lord. So they sanctified the house of the Lord in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed all the house of the Lord, the altar of burnt offerings with all its articles, and the table of the showbread with all its articles. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_19"><sup>19</sup>Moreover all the articles which King Ahaz in his reign had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 28:24">⚓</a>cast aside in his transgression we have prepared and sanctified; and there they <i>are,</i> before the altar of the Lord.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Hezekiah Restores Temple Worship</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_29_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then King Hezekiah rose early, gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_21"><sup>21</sup>And they brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 4:3–14">⚓</a>sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. Then he commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer <i>them</i> on the altar of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_22"><sup>22</sup>So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 8:14, 15, 19, 24; Heb. 9:21">⚓</a>sprinkled <i>it</i> on the altar. Likewise they killed the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also killed the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_23"><sup>23</sup>Then they brought out the male goats <i>for</i> the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 4:15, 24; 8:14">⚓</a>hands on them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_24"><sup>24</sup>And the priests killed them; and they presented their blood on the altar as a sin offering <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 14:20">⚓</a>to make an atonement for all Israel, for the king commanded <i>that</i> the burnt offering and the sin offering <i>be</i> <i>made</i> for all Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_25"> <sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 16:4; 25:6">⚓</a>And he stationed the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23:5; 25:1; 2 Chr. 8:14">⚓</a>according to the commandment of David, of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 24:11">⚓</a>Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:12">⚓</a>for thus <i>was</i> the commandment of the Lord by His prophets. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_26"><sup>26</sup>The Levites stood with the instruments <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23:5; Amos 6:5">⚓</a>of David, and the priests with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 10:8, 10; 1 Chr. 15:24; 16:6; 2 Chr. 5:12">⚓</a>the trumpets. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_27"><sup>27</sup>Then Hezekiah commanded <i>them</i> to offer the burnt offering on the altar. And when the burnt offering began, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 23:18">⚓</a>the song of the Lord<i>also</i> began, with the trumpets and with the instruments of David king of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_28"><sup>28</sup>So all the assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all <i>this</i> <i>continued</i> until the burnt offering was finished. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_29"><sup>29</sup>And when they had finished offering, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 20:18">⚓</a>the king and all who were present with him bowed and worshiped. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_30"><sup>30</sup>Moreover King Hezekiah and the leaders commanded the Levites to sing praise to the Lord with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then Hezekiah answered and said, “Now <i>that</i> you have consecrated yourselves to the Lord, come near, and bring sacrifices and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 7:12">⚓</a>thank offerings into the house of the Lord.” So the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings, and as many as were of a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 35:5, 22">⚓</a>willing heart <i>brought</i> burnt offerings. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_32"><sup>32</sup>And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, <i>and</i> two hundred lambs; all these <i>were</i> for a burnt offering to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_33"><sup>33</sup>The consecrated things <i>were</i> six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_34"><sup>34</sup>But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings; therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 35:11">⚓</a>their brethren the Levites helped them until the work was ended and until the <i>other</i> priests had sanctified themselves, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:3">⚓</a>for the Levites were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 7:10">⚓</a>more diligent in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:5">⚓</a>sanctifying themselves than the priests. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_35"><sup>35</sup>Also the burnt offerings <i>were</i> in abundance, with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 3:15, 16">⚓</a>the fat of the peace offerings and <i>with</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 15:5–10">⚓</a>the drink offerings for <i>every</i> burnt offering.<br/> So the service of the house of the Lord was set in order. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_29_36"><sup>36</sup>Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced that God had prepared the people, since the events took place so suddenly.<br/></span>
