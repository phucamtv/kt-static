<div class="title"><h1>30</h1><h3>Hezekiah Keeps the Passover</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_30_1"> <sup>1</sup>And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to the Lord God of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_2"><sup>2</sup>For the king and his leaders and all the assembly in Jerusalem had agreed to keep the Passover in the second <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 9:10, 11; 2 Chr. 30:13, 15">⚓</a>month. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_3"><sup>3</sup>For they could not keep it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:6, 18">⚓</a>at the regular time, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:17, 34">⚓</a>because a sufficient number of priests had not consecrated themselves, nor had the people gathered together at Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_4"><sup>4</sup>And the matter pleased the king and all the assembly. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_5"><sup>5</sup>So they resolved to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem, since they had not done <i>it</i> for a long <i>time</i> in the <i>prescribed</i> manner.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 8:14; Job 9:25; Jer. 51:31">⚓</a>runners went throughout all Israel and Judah with the letters from the king and his leaders, and spoke according to the command of the king: “Children of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 4:1; Joel 2:13)">⚓</a>return to the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel; then He will return to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:19, 29">⚓</a>the kings of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 28:20">⚓</a>Assyria. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_7"><sup>7</sup>And do not be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 20:18">⚓</a>like your fathers and your brethren, who trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers, so that He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 1:9">⚓</a>gave them up to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:8">⚓</a>desolation, as you see. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_8"><sup>8</sup>Now do not be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:9; Deut. 10:16; Acts 7:51">⚓</a>stiff-necked, as your fathers <i>were, but</i> yield yourselves to the Lord; and enter His sanctuary, which He has sanctified forever, and serve the Lord your God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:10">⚓</a>that the fierceness of His wrath may turn away from you. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_9"><sup>9</sup>For if you return to the Lord, your brethren and your children <i>will</i> <i>be</i> <i>treated</i> with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 106:46">⚓</a>compassion by those who lead them captive, so that they may come back to this land; for the Lord your God <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 34:6; Mic. 7:18)">⚓</a>gracious and merciful, and will not turn <i>His</i> face from you if you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 55:7)">⚓</a>return to Him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_10"> <sup>10</sup>So the runners passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:16">⚓</a>they laughed at them and mocked them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_11"><sup>11</sup>Nevertheless <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 11:16; 30:18, 21">⚓</a>some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_12"><sup>12</sup>Also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 3:5; Phil. 2:13; Heb. 13:20, 21)">⚓</a>the hand of God was on Judah to give them singleness of heart to obey the command of the king and the leaders, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:25">⚓</a>at the word of the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now many people, a very great assembly, gathered at Jerusalem to keep the Feast of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:6; Num. 9:11">⚓</a>Unleavened Bread in the second month. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_14"><sup>14</sup>They arose and took away the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 28:24">⚓</a>altars that <i>were</i> in Jerusalem, and they took away all the incense altars and cast <i>them</i> into the Brook <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:16">⚓</a>Kidron. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_15"><sup>15</sup>Then they slaughtered the Passover <i>lambs</i> on the fourteenth <i>day</i> of the second month. The priests and the Levites were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:34">⚓</a>ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought the burnt offerings to the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_16"><sup>16</sup>They stood in their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 35:10, 15">⚓</a>place according to their custom, according to the Law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood <i>received</i> from the hand of the Levites. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_17"><sup>17</sup>For <i>there</i> <i>were</i> many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:34">⚓</a>therefore the Levites had charge of the slaughter of the Passover <i>lambs</i> for everyone <i>who</i> <i>was</i> not clean, to sanctify <i>them</i> to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_18"><sup>18</sup>For a multitude of the people, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:1, 11, 25">⚓</a>many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:43–49; (Num. 9:10)">⚓</a>yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the good Lord provide atonement for everyone </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_19"><sup>19</sup><i>who</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 19:3">⚓</a>prepares his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though <i>he</i> <i>is</i> not <i>cleansed</i> according to the purification of the sanctuary.” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_20"><sup>20</sup>And the Lord listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_21"> <sup>21</sup>So the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:15; 13:6; 1 Kin. 8:65">⚓</a>the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day, <i>singing</i> to the Lord, accompanied by loud instruments. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_22"><sup>22</sup>And Hezekiah gave encouragement to all the Levites <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 33:10); 2 Chr. 17:9; 35:3">⚓</a>who taught the good knowledge of the Lord; and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 10:11">⚓</a>making confession to the Lord God of their fathers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then the whole assembly agreed to keep <i>the</i> <i>feast</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:65; 2 Chr. 35:17, 18">⚓</a>another seven days, and they kept it <i>another</i> seven days with gladness. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_24"><sup>24</sup>For Hezekiah king of Judah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 35:7, 8">⚓</a>gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the leaders gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:34">⚓</a>sanctified themselves. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_25"><sup>25</sup>The whole assembly of Judah rejoiced, also the priests and Levites, all the assembly that came from Israel, the sojourners <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:11, 18">⚓</a>who came from the land of Israel, and those who dwelt in Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_26"><sup>26</sup>So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 7:8–10">⚓</a>Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, <i>there</i> <i>had</i> been nothing like this in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_30_27"><sup>27</sup>Then the priests, the Levites, arose and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 6:23">⚓</a>blessed the people, and their voice was heard; and their prayer came <i>up</i> to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 26:15; Ps. 68:5">⚓</a>His holy dwelling place, to heaven.<br/></span>
