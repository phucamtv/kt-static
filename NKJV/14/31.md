<div class="title"><h1>31</h1><h3>The Reforms of Hezekiah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_31_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:4">⚓</a>broke the <i>sacred</i> pillars in pieces, cut down the wooden images, and threw down the high places and the altars—from all Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh—until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned to their own cities, every man to his possession.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_2"> <sup>2</sup>And Hezekiah appointed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23:6; 24:1">⚓</a>the divisions of the priests and the Levites according to their divisions, each man according to his service, the priests and Levites <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23:30, 31">⚓</a>for burnt offerings and peace offerings, to serve, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_3"><sup>3</sup>The king also <i>appointed</i> a portion of his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 35:7">⚓</a>possessions for the burnt offerings: for the morning and evening burnt offerings, the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and the New Moons and the set feasts, as <i>it</i> <i>is</i> written in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 28:1—29:40">⚓</a>Law of the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_4"> <sup>4</sup>Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to contribute <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 18:8; 2 Kin. 12:16; Neh. 13:10; Ezek. 44:29">⚓</a>support for the priests and the Levites, that they might devote themselves to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 2:7">⚓</a>the Law of the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_5"> <sup>5</sup>As soon as the commandment was circulated, the children of Israel brought in abundance <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:29; Neh. 13:12">⚓</a>the firstfruits of grain and wine, oil and honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 27:30); Deut. 14:28; 26:12, 13">⚓</a>tithe of everything. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_6"><sup>6</sup>And the children of Israel and Judah, who dwelt in the cities of Judah, brought the tithe of oxen and sheep; also the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 27:30); Deut. 14:28">⚓</a>tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the Lord their God they laid in heaps.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_7"> <sup>7</sup>In the third month they began laying them in heaps, and they finished in the seventh month. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_8"><sup>8</sup>And when Hezekiah and the leaders came and saw the heaps, they blessed the Lord and His people Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_9"><sup>9</sup>Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_10"><sup>10</sup>And Azariah the chief priest, from the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 6:8, 9">⚓</a>house of Zadok, answered him and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mal. 3:10)">⚓</a>“Since <i>the</i> <i>people</i> began to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord, we have had enough to eat and have plenty left, for the Lord has blessed His people; and what is left <i>is</i> this great <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 36:5">⚓</a>abundance.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now Hezekiah commanded <i>them</i> to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:5–8">⚓</a>prepare rooms in the house of the Lord, and they prepared them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_12"><sup>12</sup>Then they faithfully brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the dedicated things; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 35:9; Neh. 13:13">⚓</a>Cononiah the Levite had charge of them, and Shimei his brother <i>was</i> the next. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_13"><sup>13</sup>Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah <i>were</i> overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 9:11; Jer. 20:1">⚓</a>ruler of the house of God. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_14"><sup>14</sup>Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the East Gate, <i>was</i> over the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 23:23; 2 Chr. 35:8">⚓</a>freewill offerings to God, to distribute the offerings of the Lord and the most holy things. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_15"><sup>15</sup>And under him <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:12">⚓</a>Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, <i>his</i> faithful assistants in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 21:1–3, 9">⚓</a>the cities of the priests, to distribute <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 9:26">⚓</a>allotments to their brethren by divisions, to the great as well as the small.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_16"> <sup>16</sup>Besides those males from three years old and up who were written in the genealogy, they distributed to everyone who entered the house of the Lord his daily portion for the work of his service, by his division, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_17"><sup>17</sup>and to the priests who were written in the genealogy according to their father’s house, and to the Levites <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23:24, 27">⚓</a>from twenty years old and up according to their work, by their divisions, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_18"><sup>18</sup>and to all who were written in the genealogy—their little ones and their wives, their sons and daughters, the whole company of them—for in their faithfulness they sanctified themselves in holiness.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_19"> <sup>19</sup>Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, <i>who</i> <i>were</i> in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 25:34; Num. 35:1–4">⚓</a>the fields of the common-lands of their cities, in every single city, <i>there</i> <i>were</i> men who were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 31:12–15">⚓</a>designated by name to distribute portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were listed by genealogies among the Levites.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_20"> <sup>20</sup>Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:3; 22:2">⚓</a>did what <i>was</i> good and right and true before the Lord his God. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_31_21"><sup>21</sup>And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, in the law and in the commandment, to seek his God, he did <i>it</i> with all his heart. So he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 26:5; 32:30; Ps. 1:3">⚓</a>prospered.<br/></span>
