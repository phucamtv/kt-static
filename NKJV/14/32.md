<div class="title"><h1>32</h1><h3>Sennacherib Boasts Against the Lord</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_32_1"> <sup>1</sup>After <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:13—19:37; Is. 36:1—37:38">⚓</a>these deeds of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered Judah; he encamped against the fortified cities, thinking to win them over to himself. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_2"><sup>2</sup>And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that his purpose was to make war against Jerusalem, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_3"><sup>3</sup>he consulted with his leaders and commanders to stop the water from the springs which <i>were</i> outside the city; and they helped him. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_4"><sup>4</sup>Thus many people gathered together who stopped all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:20">⚓</a>springs and the brook that ran through the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_5"><sup>5</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 22:9, 10">⚓</a>he strengthened himself, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:4; 2 Chr. 25:23">⚓</a>built up all the wall that was broken, raised <i>it</i> up to the towers, and <i>built</i> another wall outside; also he repaired the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 5:9; 1 Kin. 9:15, 24; 11:27; 2 Kin. 12:20; 1 Chr. 11:8">⚓</a>Millo <i>in</i> the City of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_6"><sup>6</sup>Then he set military captains over the people, gathered them together to him in the open square of the city gate, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:22; Is. 40:2">⚓</a>gave them encouragement, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 31:6)">⚓</a>“Be strong and courageous; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 20:15">⚓</a>do not be afraid nor dismayed before the king of Assyria, nor before all the multitude that <i>is</i> with him; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 6:16; (Rom. 8:31)">⚓</a><i>there</i> <i>are</i> more with us than with him. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_8"><sup>8</sup>With him <i>is</i> an <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 17:5; 1 John 4:4)">⚓</a>arm of flesh; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:13; (1 Sam. 17:45–47); 2 Chr. 13:12; 20:17; (Rom. 8:31)">⚓</a>with us <i>is</i> the Lord our God, to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people were strengthened by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:17">⚓</a>After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he and all the forces with him <i>laid</i> <i>siege</i> against Lachish), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who <i>were</i> in Jerusalem, saying, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:19">⚓</a>“Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: ‘In what do you trust, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem? </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_11"><sup>11</sup>Does not Hezekiah persuade you to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:30">⚓</a>“The Lord our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria”? </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:22">⚓</a>Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, “You shall worship before one altar and burn incense on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 31:1, 2">⚓</a>it”? </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_13"><sup>13</sup>Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of <i>other</i> lands? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:33–35">⚓</a>Were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand? </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_14"><sup>14</sup>Who <i>was</i> <i>there</i> among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people from my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you from my <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 10:5–12)">⚓</a>hand? </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_15"><sup>15</sup>Now therefore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:29">⚓</a>do not let Hezekiah deceive you or persuade you like this, and do not believe him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand?’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_16"> <sup>16</sup>Furthermore, his servants spoke against the Lord God and against His servant Hezekiah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_17"> <sup>17</sup>He also wrote letters to revile the Lord God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:9; (1 Cor. 8:5, 6)">⚓</a>“As the gods of the nations of <i>other</i> lands have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:12; Dan. 3:15">⚓</a>hand.” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:28; Ps. 59:6">⚓</a>Then they called out with a loud voice in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who <i>were</i> on the wall, to frighten them and trouble them, that they might take the city. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_19"><sup>19</sup>And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:18; (Ps. 96:5; 115:4–8)">⚓</a>the work of men’s hands.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Sennacherib’s Defeat and Death</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_32_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:15">⚓</a>Now because of this King Hezekiah and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:2">⚓</a>the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, prayed and cried out to heaven. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:35; Is. 10:12–19; Zech. 14:3">⚓</a>Then the Lord sent an angel who cut down every mighty man of valor, leader, and captain in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 44:7">⚓</a>shamefaced to his own land. And when he had gone into the temple of his god, some of his own offspring struck him down with the sword there.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_22"> <sup>22</sup>Thus the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all <i>others,</i> and guided them on every side. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_23"><sup>23</sup>And many brought gifts to the Lord at Jerusalem, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 8:10; 2 Chr. 17:5; 26:8; Ps. 45:12">⚓</a>presents to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 1:1">⚓</a>exalted in the sight of all nations thereafter.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Hezekiah Humbles Himself</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_32_24"> <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:1–11; Is. 38:1–8">⚓</a>In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death, and he prayed to the Lord; and He spoke to him and gave him a sign. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_25"><sup>25</sup>But Hezekiah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 116:12">⚓</a>did not repay according to the favor <i>shown</i> him, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 26:16; (Hab. 2:4)">⚓</a>his heart was lifted up; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 24:18">⚓</a>therefore wrath was looming over him and over Judah and Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_26"><sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 26:18, 19">⚓</a>Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the Lord did not come upon them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:19">⚓</a>in the days of Hezekiah.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Hezekiah’s Wealth and Honor</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_32_27"> <sup>27</sup>Hezekiah had very great riches and honor. And he made himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of desirable items; </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_28"><sup>28</sup>storehouses for the harvest of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of livestock, and folds for flocks. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_29"><sup>29</sup>Moreover he provided cities for himself, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 29:12">⚓</a>God had given him very much property. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 22:9–11">⚓</a>This same Hezekiah also stopped the water outlet of Upper Gihon, and brought the water by tunnel to the west side of the City of David. Hezekiah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 31:21">⚓</a>prospered in all his works.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_31"> <sup>31</sup>However, <i>regarding</i> the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, whom they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:12; Is. 39:1">⚓</a>sent to him to inquire about the wonder that was <i>done</i> in the land, God withdrew from him, in order to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 8:2, 16)">⚓</a>test him, that He might know all <i>that</i> <i>was</i> in his heart.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Hezekiah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_32_32"> <sup>32</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, indeed they <i>are</i> written in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 36—39">⚓</a>the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, <i>and</i> in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18—20">⚓</a>book of the kings of Judah and Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_32_33"><sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:21; 2 Kin. 20:21">⚓</a>So Hezekiah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 112:6; Prov. 10:7">⚓</a>honored him at his death. Then Manasseh his son reigned in his place.<br/></span>
