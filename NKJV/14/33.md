<div class="title"><h1>33</h1><h3>Manasseh Reigns in Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_33_1"> <sup>1</sup>Manasseh <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 21:1–9">⚓</a><i>was</i> twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_2"><sup>2</sup>But he did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 18:9–12); 2 Chr. 28:3; (Jer. 15:4)">⚓</a>abominations of the nations whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_3"><sup>3</sup>For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:4; 2 Chr. 30:14; 31:1">⚓</a>broken down; he raised up altars for the Baals, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 16:21; 2 Kin. 23:5, 6">⚓</a>made wooden images; and he worshiped <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:3">⚓</a>all the host of heaven and served them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_4"><sup>4</sup>He also built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord had said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:11; 1 Kin. 8:29; 9:3; 2 Chr. 6:6; 7:16">⚓</a>“In Jerusalem shall My name be forever.” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_5"><sup>5</sup>And he built altars for all the host of heaven <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 4:9">⚓</a>in the two courts of the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 18:21); Deut. 18:10; 2 Kin. 23:10; 2 Chr. 28:3; Ezek. 23:37, 39">⚓</a>Also he caused his sons to pass through the fire in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom; he practiced <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 18:11; 2 Kin. 17:17">⚓</a>soothsaying, used witchcraft and sorcery, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 19:31; 20:27); 2 Kin. 21:6">⚓</a>consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 21:7; 2 Chr. 25:14">⚓</a>He even set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 132:14">⚓</a>“In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever; </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:10">⚓</a>and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers—only if they are careful to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_9"><sup>9</sup>So Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the Lord had destroyed before the children of Israel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Manasseh Restored After Repentance</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_33_10"> <sup>10</sup>And the Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they would not listen. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:36">⚓</a>Therefore the Lord brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with hooks, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:6; Job 36:8; Ps. 107:10, 11">⚓</a>bound him with bronze <i>fetters,</i> and carried him off to Babylon. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_12"><sup>12</sup>Now when he was in affliction, he implored the Lord his God, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 7:14; 32:26; (1 Pet. 5:6)">⚓</a>humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_13"><sup>13</sup>and prayed to Him; and He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 5:20; Ezra 8:23">⚓</a>received his entreaty, heard his supplication, and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 20:13; Ps. 9:16; Dan. 4:25">⚓</a>knew that the Lord<i>was</i> God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_14"> <sup>14</sup>After this he built a wall outside the City of David on the west side of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:33">⚓</a>Gihon, in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate; and <i>it</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 27:3">⚓</a>enclosed Ophel, and he raised it to a very great height. Then he put military captains in all the fortified cities of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_15"><sup>15</sup>He took away <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 33:3, 5, 7">⚓</a>the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the Lord, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the Lord and in Jerusalem; and he cast <i>them</i> out of the city. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_16"><sup>16</sup>He also repaired the altar of the Lord, sacrificed peace offerings and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 7:12">⚓</a>thank offerings on it, and commanded Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 32:12">⚓</a>Nevertheless the people still sacrificed on the high places, <i>but</i> only to the Lord their God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death of Manasseh</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_33_18"> <sup>18</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:9">⚓</a>the seers who spoke to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel, indeed they <i>are</i> <i>written</i> in the book of the kings of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_19"><sup>19</sup>Also his prayer and <i>how</i> <i>God</i> received his entreaty, and all his sin and trespass, and the sites where he built high places and set up wooden images and carved images, before he was humbled, indeed they <i>are</i> written among the sayings of Hozai. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:21; 2 Kin. 21:18">⚓</a>So Manasseh rested with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. Then his son Amon reigned in his place.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Amon’s Reign and Death</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_33_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 21:19–24; 1 Chr. 3:14">⚓</a>Amon <i>was</i> twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_22"><sup>22</sup>But he did evil in the sight of the Lord, as his father Manasseh had done; for Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which his father Manasseh had made, and served them. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_23"><sup>23</sup>And he did not humble himself before the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 33:12, 19">⚓</a>as his father Manasseh had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_24"> <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 21:23, 24; 2 Chr. 24:25">⚓</a>Then his servants conspired against him, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 25:27">⚓</a>killed him in his own house. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_33_25"><sup>25</sup>But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon. Then the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.<br/></span>
