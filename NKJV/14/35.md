<span class="verse 2su_35_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:21, 22">⚓</a>Josiah kept a Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the Passover <i>lambs</i> on the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:6; Num. 9:3; Ezra 6:19">⚓</a>fourteenth <i>day</i> of the first month. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_2"><sup>2</sup>And he set the priests in their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 23:18; Ezra 6:18">⚓</a>duties and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:5–15">⚓</a>encouraged them for the service of the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_3"><sup>3</sup>Then he said to the Levites <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:10; 2 Chr. 17:8, 9; Neh. 8:7">⚓</a>who taught all Israel, who were holy to the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 34:14">⚓</a>“Put the holy ark <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 40:21; 2 Chr. 5:7">⚓</a>in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23:26">⚓</a><i>It</i> <i>shall</i> no longer <i>be</i> a burden on <i>your</i> shoulders. Now serve the Lord your God and His people Israel. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_4"><sup>4</sup>Prepare <i>yourselves</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 9:10–13">⚓</a>according to your fathers’ houses, according to your divisions, following the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23—26">⚓</a>written instruction of David king of Israel and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 8:14">⚓</a>written instruction of Solomon his son. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_5"><sup>5</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 134:1">⚓</a>stand in the holy <i>place</i> according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brethren the <i>lay</i> people, and <i>according</i> <i>to</i> the division of the father’s house of the Levites. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_6"><sup>6</sup>So slaughter the Passover <i>offerings,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:5, 15">⚓</a>consecrate yourselves, and prepare <i>them</i> for your brethren, that <i>they</i> may do according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then Josiah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:24">⚓</a>gave the <i>lay</i> people lambs and young goats from the flock, all for Passover <i>offerings</i> for all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, as well as three thousand cattle; these <i>were</i> from the king’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 31:3">⚓</a>possessions. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_8"><sup>8</sup>And his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 7:2">⚓</a>leaders gave willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover <i>offerings</i> two thousand six hundred <i>from</i> <i>the</i> <i>flock,</i> and three hundred cattle. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_9"><sup>9</sup>Also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 31:12">⚓</a>Conaniah, his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave to the Levites for Passover <i>offerings</i> five thousand <i>from</i> <i>the</i> <i>flock</i> and five hundred cattle.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_10"> <sup>10</sup>So the service was prepared, and the priests <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 6:18; Heb. 9:6">⚓</a>stood in their places, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 5:12; 7:6; 8:14, 15; 13:10; 29:25–34">⚓</a>Levites in their divisions, according to the king’s command. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_11"><sup>11</sup>And they slaughtered the Passover <i>offerings;</i> and the priests <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:22; 2 Chr. 29:22">⚓</a>sprinkled <i>the</i> <i>blood</i> with their hands, while the Levites <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:34">⚓</a>skinned <i>the</i> <i>animals.</i></span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_12"><sup>12</sup>Then they removed the burnt offerings that <i>they</i> might give them to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the <i>lay</i> people, to offer to the Lord, as <i>it</i> <i>is</i> written <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 3:3; Ezra 6:18">⚓</a>in the Book of Moses. And so <i>they</i> <i>did</i> with the cattle. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_13"><sup>13</sup>Also they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:8, 9; Deut. 16:7">⚓</a>roasted the Passover <i>offerings</i> with fire according to the ordinance; but the <i>other</i> holy <i>offerings</i> they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:13–15">⚓</a>boiled in pots, in caldrons, and in pans, and divided <i>them</i> quickly among all the <i>lay</i> people. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_14"><sup>14</sup>Then afterward they prepared portions for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, <i>were</i> <i>busy</i> in offering burnt offerings and fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared portions for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_15"><sup>15</sup>And the singers, the sons of Asaph, <i>were</i> in their places, according to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 25:1–6">⚓</a>command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer. Also the gatekeepers <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 9:17, 18">⚓</a>were at each gate; they did not have to leave their position, because their brethren the Levites prepared portions for them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_16"> <sup>16</sup>So all the service of the Lord was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord, according to the command of King Josiah. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_17"><sup>17</sup>And the children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:15; 13:6; 2 Chr. 30:21">⚓</a>Unleavened Bread for seven days. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:22, 23">⚓</a>There had been no Passover kept in Israel like that since the days of Samuel the prophet; and none of the kings of Israel had kept such a Passover as Josiah kept, with the priests and the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_19"><sup>19</sup>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Josiah Dies in Battle</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2su_35_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:29">⚓</a>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 10:9; Jer. 46:2">⚓</a>Carchemish by the Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him. </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_21"><sup>21</sup>But he sent messengers to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, king of Judah? <i>I</i> <i>have</i> not <i>come</i> against you this day, but against the house with which I have war; for God commanded me to make haste. Refrain <i>from</i> <i>meddling</i> <i>with</i> God, who <i>is</i> with me, lest He destroy you.” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_22"><sup>22</sup>Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:30; 2 Chr. 18:29">⚓</a>disguised himself so that he might fight with him, and did not heed the words of Necho from the mouth of God. So he came to fight in the Valley of Megiddo.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_23"> <sup>23</sup>And the archers shot King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am severely wounded.” </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:30">⚓</a>His servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had, and they brought him to Jerusalem. So he died, and was buried in <i>one</i> <i>of</i> the tombs of his fathers. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 14:18; Zech. 12:11">⚓</a>all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_25"> <sup>25</sup>Jeremiah also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lam. 4:20">⚓</a>lamented for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 22:10, 11">⚓</a>Josiah. And to this day <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:23">⚓</a>all the singing men and the singing women speak of Josiah in their lamentations. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 22:20">⚓</a>They made it a custom in Israel; and indeed they <i>are</i> written in the Laments.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_26"> <sup>26</sup>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his goodness, according to <i>what</i> <i>was</i> written in the Law of the Lord, </span>
<span class="verse 2su_35_27"><sup>27</sup>and his deeds from first to last, indeed they <i>are</i> written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.<br/></span>
