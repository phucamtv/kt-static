<span class="verse exo_3_2"><sup>2</sup>Then Jeshua the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 6:14, 15; Ezra 4:3; Neh. 12:1, 8; Hag. 1:1; 2:2">⚓</a>Jozadak and his brethren the priests, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 2:2; 4:2, 3; 5:2">⚓</a>and Zerubbabel the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 3:17">⚓</a>Shealtiel and his brethren, arose and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as <i>it</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:5, 6">⚓</a>written in the Law of Moses the man of God. </span>
<span class="verse exo_3_3"><sup>3</sup>Though fear <i>had</i> <i>come</i> upon them because of the people of those countries, they set the altar on its bases; and they offered <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 28:3">⚓</a>burnt offerings on it to the Lord, <i>both</i> the morning and evening burnt offerings. </span>
<span class="verse exo_3_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:33–43; Neh. 8:14–18; Zech. 14:16">⚓</a>They also kept the Feast of Tabernacles, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:16">⚓</a>as <i>it</i> <i>is</i> written, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 29:12, 13">⚓</a><i>offered</i> the daily burnt offerings in the number required by ordinance for each day. </span>

<span class="verse exo_3_6"><sup>6</sup>From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord, although the foundation of the temple of the Lord had not been laid. </span>
<span class="verse exo_3_7"><sup>7</sup>They also gave money to the masons and the carpenters, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:6, 9; 2 Chr. 2:10; Acts 12:20">⚓</a>food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre to bring cedar logs from Lebanon to the sea, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 2:16; Acts 9:36">⚓</a>Joppa, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 1:2; 6:3">⚓</a>according to the permission which they had from Cyrus king of Persia.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Restoration of the Temple Begins</h3></div>
<span class="verse exo_3_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now in the second month of the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 3:2; 4:3">⚓</a>Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began <i>work</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 23:4, 24">⚓</a>and appointed the Levites from twenty years old and above to oversee the work of the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse exo_3_9"><sup>9</sup>Then Jeshua <i>with</i> his sons and brothers, Kadmiel <i>with</i> his sons, and the sons of Judah, arose as one to oversee those working on the house of God: the sons of Henadad <i>with</i> their sons and their brethren the Levites.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_3_10"> <sup>10</sup>When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 16:5, 6">⚓</a>the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the Lord, according to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 6:31; 16:4; 25:1">⚓</a>ordinance of David king of Israel. </span>

<span class="verse exo_3_12"> <sup>12</sup>But many of the priests and Levites and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 2:68">⚓</a>heads of the fathers’ <i>houses,</i> old men who had seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this temple was laid before their eyes. Yet many shouted aloud for joy, </span>
<span class="verse exo_3_13"><sup>13</sup>so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard afar off.<br/></span>
