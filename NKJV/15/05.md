<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Restoration of the Temple Resumed</h3></div>
<span class="verse exo_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the prophet <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hag. 1:1">⚓</a>Haggai and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 1:1">⚓</a>Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophets, prophesied to the Jews who <i>were</i> in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel, <i>who</i> <i>was</i> over them. </span>
<span class="verse exo_5_2"><sup>2</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 3:2; Hag. 1:12">⚓</a>Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and began to build the house of God which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 6:14; Hag. 2:4">⚓</a>the prophets of God <i>were</i> with them, helping them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_5_3"> <sup>3</sup>At the same time <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 5:6; 6:6">⚓</a>Tattenai the governor of <i>the</i> <i>region</i> beyond the River and Shethar-Boznai and their companions came to them and spoke thus to them: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 1:3; 5:9">⚓</a>“Who has commanded you to build this temple and finish this wall?” </span>
<span class="verse exo_5_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 5:10">⚓</a>Then, accordingly, we told them the names of the men who were constructing this building. </span>
<span class="verse exo_5_5"><sup>5</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 16:9; Ezra 7:6, 28; Ps. 33:18">⚓</a>the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, so that they could not make them cease till a report could go to Darius. Then a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 6:6">⚓</a>written answer was returned concerning this <i>matter.</i></span>
<span class="verse exo_5_6"><sup>6</sup>This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai sent:<br/>  The governor of <i>the</i> <i>region</i> beyond the River, and Shethar-Boznai, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 4:7–10">⚓</a>and his companions, the Persians who <i>were</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>region</i> beyond the River, to Darius the king.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_5_7"> <sup>7</sup>(They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus)<br/>  To Darius the king:<br/>   All peace.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_5_8">   <sup>8</sup>Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judea, to the temple of the great God, which is being built with heavy stones, and timber is being laid in the walls; and this work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_5_9">   <sup>9</sup>Then we asked those elders, <i>and</i> spoke thus to them: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 5:3, 4">⚓</a>“Who commanded you to build this temple and to finish these walls?”</span>
<span class="verse exo_5_10">   <sup>10</sup>We also asked them their names to inform you, that we might write the names of the men who <i>were</i> chief among them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_5_11">   <sup>11</sup>And thus they returned us an answer, saying: “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:1, 38">⚓</a>and completed.</span>
<span class="verse exo_5_12">   <sup>12</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 34:25; 36:16, 17">⚓</a>because our fathers provoked the God of heaven to wrath, He gave them into the hand of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:2; 25:8–11; 2 Chr. 36:17; Jer. 52:12–15">⚓</a>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, <i>who</i> destroyed this temple and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 13:19">⚓</a>carried the people away to Babylon.</span>
<span class="verse exo_5_13">   <sup>13</sup>However, in the first year of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 1:1">⚓</a>Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to build this house of God.</span>
<span class="verse exo_5_14">   <sup>14</sup>Also, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 1:7, 8; 6:5; Dan. 5:2">⚓</a>the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple that <i>was</i> in Jerusalem and carried into the temple of Babylon—those King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon, and they were given to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hag. 1:14; 2:2, 21">⚓</a>one named Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor.</span>
<span class="verse exo_5_15">   <sup>15</sup>And he said to him, ‘Take these articles; go, carry them to the temple <i>site</i> that <i>is</i> in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its former site.’</span>
<span class="verse exo_5_16">   <sup>16</sup>Then the same Sheshbazzar came <i>and</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 3:8–10; Hag. 2:18">⚓</a>laid the foundation of the house of God which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem; but from that time even until now it has been under construction, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 6:15">⚓</a>it is not finished.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_5_17">   <sup>17</sup>Now therefore, if <i>it</i> <i>seems</i> good to the king, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 6:1, 2">⚓</a>let a search be made in the king’s treasure house, which <i>is</i> there in Babylon, whether it is <i>so</i> that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send us his pleasure concerning this <i>matter.</i><br/></span>
