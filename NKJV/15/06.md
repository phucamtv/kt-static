<span class="verse exo_6_2"><sup>2</sup>And at Achmetha, in the palace that <i>is</i> in the province of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:6">⚓</a>Media, a scroll was found, and in it a record <i>was</i> written thus:<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_6_3">  <sup>3</sup>In the first year of King Cyrus, King Cyrus issued a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 1:1; 5:13">⚓</a>decree <i>concerning</i> the house of God at Jerusalem: “Let the house be rebuilt, the place where they offered sacrifices; and let the foundations of it be firmly laid, its height sixty cubits <i>and</i> its width sixty cubits,</span>
<span class="verse exo_6_4">  <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:36">⚓</a><i>with</i> three rows of heavy stones and one row of new timber. Let the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 3:7">⚓</a>expenses be paid from the king’s treasury.</span>
<span class="verse exo_6_5">  <sup>5</sup>Also let <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 1:7, 8; 5:14">⚓</a>the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and taken back to the temple which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem, <i>each</i> to its place; and deposit <i>them</i> in the house of God”—<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_6_6">   <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 5:3, 6">⚓</a>Now <i>therefore,</i> Tattenai, governor of <i>the</i> <i>region</i> beyond the River, and Shethar-Boznai, and your companions the Persians who <i>are</i> beyond the River, keep yourselves far from there.</span>
<span class="verse exo_6_7">   <sup>7</sup>Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_6_8">   <sup>8</sup>Moreover I issue a decree <i>as</i> <i>to</i> what you shall do for the elders of these Jews, for the building of this house of God: Let the cost be paid at the king’s expense from taxes <i>on</i> <i>the</i> <i>region</i> beyond the River; this is to be given immediately to these men, so that they are not hindered.</span>
<span class="verse exo_6_9">   <sup>9</sup>And whatever they need—young bulls, rams, and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the request of the priests who <i>are</i> in Jerusalem—let it be given them day by day without fail,</span>
<span class="verse exo_6_10">   <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 7:23; (Jer. 29:7; 1 Tim. 2:1, 2)">⚓</a>that they may offer sacrifices of sweet aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and his sons.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_6_11">   <sup>11</sup>Also I issue a decree that whoever alters this edict, let a timber be pulled from his house and erected, and let him be hanged on it; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:5; 3:29">⚓</a>and let his house be made a refuse heap because of this. </span>
<span class="verse exo_6_12">   <sup>12</sup>And may the God who causes His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:5, 11; 1 Kin. 9:3">⚓</a>name to dwell there destroy any king or people who put their hand to alter it, or to destroy this house of God which is in Jerusalem. I Darius issue a decree; let it be done diligently.<br/></span>
