<span class="verse exo_7_13">   <sup>13</sup>I issue a decree that all those of the people of Israel and the priests and Levites in my realm, who volunteer to go up to Jerusalem, may go with you.</span>
<span class="verse exo_7_14">   <sup>14</sup>And whereas you are being sent by the king and his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 1:14">⚓</a>seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, with regard to the Law of your God which <i>is</i> in your hand;</span>
<span class="verse exo_7_15">   <sup>15</sup>and <i>whereas</i> <i>you</i> <i>are</i> to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 6:2; Ezra 6:12; Ps. 135:21">⚓</a>whose dwelling <i>is</i> in Jerusalem;</span>

<span class="verse exo_7_20">   <sup>20</sup>And whatever more may be needed for the house of your God, which you may have occasion to provide, pay <i>for</i> <i>it</i> from the king’s treasury.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_7_21">   <sup>21</sup>And I, <i>even</i> I, Artaxerxes the king, issue a decree to all the treasurers who <i>are</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>region</i> beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, may require of you, let it be done diligently,</span>
<span class="verse exo_7_22">   <sup>22</sup>up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred kors of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribed limit.</span>
<span class="verse exo_7_23">   <sup>23</sup>Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it diligently be done for the house of the God of heaven. For why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_7_24">   <sup>24</sup>Also we inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tax, tribute, or custom on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God.</span>
<span class="verse exo_7_25">   <sup>25</sup>And you, Ezra, according to your God-given wisdom, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:21, 22; Deut. 16:18">⚓</a>set magistrates and judges who may judge all the people who <i>are</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>region</i> beyond the River, all such as know the laws of your God; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 17:7; Ezra 7:10; (Mal. 2:7; Col. 1:28)">⚓</a>teach those who do not know <i>them.</i></span>
<span class="verse exo_7_26">   <sup>26</sup>Whoever will not observe the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily on him, whether <i>it</i> <i>be</i> death, or banishment, or confiscation of goods, or imprisonment.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_7_27"> <sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 29:10">⚓</a>Blessed <i>be</i> the Lord God of our fathers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 6:22; (Prov. 21:1)">⚓</a>who has put <i>such</i> <i>a</i> <i>thing</i> as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of the Lord which <i>is</i> in Jerusalem, </span>
<span class="verse exo_7_28"><sup>28</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 9:9">⚓</a>has extended mercy to me before the king and his counselors, and before all the king’s mighty princes.<br/> So I was encouraged, as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 5:5; 7:6, 9; 8:18">⚓</a>the hand of the Lord my God <i>was</i> upon me; and I gathered leading men of Israel to go up with me.<br/></span>
