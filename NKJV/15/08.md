<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>Heads of Families Who Returned with Ezra</h3></div>
<span class="verse exo_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>These <i>are</i> the heads of their fathers’ <i>houses,</i> and <i>this</i> <i>is</i> the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of King Artaxerxes: </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_2"><sup>2</sup>of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 3:22; Ezra 2:68">⚓</a>Hattush; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_3"><sup>3</sup>of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 2:3">⚓</a>Parosh, Zechariah; and registered with him <i>were</i> one hundred and fifty males; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_4"><sup>4</sup>of the sons of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 10:30">⚓</a>Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_5"><sup>5</sup>of the sons of Shechaniah, Ben-Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_6"><sup>6</sup>of the sons of Adin, Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_7"><sup>7</sup>of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_8"><sup>8</sup>of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him eighty males; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_9"><sup>9</sup>of the sons of Joab, Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_10"><sup>10</sup>of the sons of Shelomith, Ben-Josiphiah, and with him one hundred and sixty males; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_11"><sup>11</sup>of the sons of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 10:28">⚓</a>Bebai, Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_12"><sup>12</sup>of the sons of Azgad, Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him one hundred and ten males; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_13"><sup>13</sup>of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names <i>are</i> these—Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah—and with them sixty males; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_14"><sup>14</sup>also of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Servants for the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse exo_8_15"> <sup>15</sup>Now I gathered them by the river that flows to Ahava, and we camped there three days. And I looked among the people and the priests, and found none of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 7:7; 8:2">⚓</a>sons of Levi there. </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_16"><sup>16</sup>Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 10:15">⚓</a>Meshullam, leaders; also for Joiarib and Elnathan, men of understanding. </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_17"><sup>17</sup>And I gave them a command for Iddo the chief man at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say to Iddo <i>and</i> his brethren the Nethinim at the place Casiphia—that they should bring us servants for the house of our God. </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_18"><sup>18</sup>Then, by the good hand of our God upon us, they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:22; Neh. 8:7">⚓</a>brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, with his sons and brothers, eighteen men; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_19"><sup>19</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 12:24">⚓</a>Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty men; </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 2:43; 7:7">⚓</a>also of the Nethinim, whom David and the leaders had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim. All of them were designated by name.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Fasting and Prayer for Protection</h3></div>
<span class="verse exo_8_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:6; 2 Chr. 20:3">⚓</a>proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava, that we might <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 16:29; 23:29; Is. 58:3, 5">⚓</a>humble ourselves before our God, to seek from Him the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 5:8">⚓</a>right way for us and our little ones and all our possessions. </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_22"><sup>22</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 9:15">⚓</a>I was ashamed to request of the king an escort of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy on the road, because we had spoken to the king, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 7:6, 9, 28">⚓</a>“The hand of our God <i>is</i> upon all those for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 33:18, 19; 34:15, 22; Rom. 8:28)">⚓</a>good who seek Him, but His power and His wrath <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 34:16)">⚓</a>against all those who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Chr. 15:2)">⚓</a>forsake Him.” </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_23"><sup>23</sup>So we fasted and entreated our God for this, and He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Chr. 5:20); 2 Chr. 33:13; Is. 19:22">⚓</a>answered our prayer.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Gifts for the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse exo_8_24"> <sup>24</sup>And I separated twelve of the leaders of the priests—Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them— </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_25"><sup>25</sup>and weighed out to them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 7:15, 16">⚓</a>the silver, the gold, and the articles, the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his princes, and all Israel <i>who</i> <i>were</i> present, had offered. </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_26"><sup>26</sup>I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, silver articles <i>weighing</i> one hundred talents, one hundred talents of gold, </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_27"><sup>27</sup>twenty gold basins <i>worth</i> a thousand drachmas, and two vessels of fine polished bronze, precious as gold. </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_28"><sup>28</sup>And I said to them, “You <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 21:6–9; Deut. 33:8">⚓</a>holy to the Lord; the articles <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 22:2, 3; Num. 4:4, 15, 19, 20">⚓</a>holy also; and the silver and the gold <i>are</i> a freewill offering to the Lord God of your fathers. </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_29"><sup>29</sup>Watch and keep <i>them</i> until you weigh <i>them</i> before the leaders of the priests and the Levites and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 4:3">⚓</a>heads of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> of Israel in Jerusalem, <i>in</i> the chambers of the house of the Lord.” </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_30"><sup>30</sup>So the priests and the Levites received the silver and the gold and the articles by weight, to bring <i>them</i> to Jerusalem to the house of our God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Return to Jerusalem</h3></div>
<span class="verse exo_8_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth <i>day</i> of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 7:6, 9, 28">⚓</a>the hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambush along the road. </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_32"><sup>32</sup>So we <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:11">⚓</a>came to Jerusalem, and stayed there three days.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_8_33"> <sup>33</sup>Now on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the articles were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 8:26, 30">⚓</a>weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him <i>was</i> Eleazar the son of Phinehas; with them <i>were</i> the Levites, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 11:16">⚓</a>Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui, </span>
<span class="verse exo_8_34"><sup>34</sup>with the number <i>and</i> weight of everything. All the weight was written down at that time.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_8_35"> <sup>35</sup>The children of those who had been <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 2:1">⚓</a>carried away captive, who had come from the captivity, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 6:17">⚓</a>offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats <i>as</i> a sin offering. All <i>this</i> <i>was</i> a burnt offering to the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_8_36"> <sup>36</sup>And they delivered the king’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 7:21–24">⚓</a>orders to the king’s satraps and the governors <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>region</i> beyond the River. So they gave support to the people and the house of God.<br/></span>
