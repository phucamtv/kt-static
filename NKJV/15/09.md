<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>Intermarriage with Pagans</h3></div>
<span class="verse exo_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>When these things were done, the leaders came to me, saying, “The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 6:21; Neh. 9:2">⚓</a>separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:30, 31">⚓</a>with respect to the abominations of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. </span>
<span class="verse exo_9_2"><sup>2</sup>For they have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:16; (Deut. 7:3); Ezra 10:2; Neh. 13:23">⚓</a>taken some of their daughters <i>as</i> <i>wives</i> for themselves and their sons, so that the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:31; (Deut. 7:6)">⚓</a>holy seed is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 6:14)">⚓</a>mixed with the peoples of <i>those</i> lands. Indeed, the hand of the leaders and rulers has been foremost in this trespass.” </span>
<span class="verse exo_9_3"><sup>3</sup>So when I heard this thing, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:20">⚓</a>I tore my garment and my robe, and plucked out some of the hair of my head and beard, and sat down <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 143:4">⚓</a>astonished. </span>
<span class="verse exo_9_4"><sup>4</sup>Then everyone who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 10:3; Is. 66:2">⚓</a>trembled at the words of the God of Israel assembled to me, because of the transgression of those who had been carried away captive, and I sat astonished until the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:39">⚓</a>evening sacrifice.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_9_5"> <sup>5</sup>At the evening sacrifice I arose from my fasting; and having torn my garment and my robe, I fell on my knees and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:29">⚓</a>spread out my hands to the Lord my God. </span>
<span class="verse exo_9_6"><sup>6</sup>And I said: “O my God, I am too <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:7, 8">⚓</a>ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to You, my God; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 38:4">⚓</a>our iniquities have risen higher than <i>our</i> heads, and our guilt has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 28:9; (Ezra 9:13, 15); Rev. 18:5">⚓</a>grown up to the heavens. </span>
<span class="verse exo_9_7"><sup>7</sup>Since the days of our fathers to this day <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:14–17; Ps. 106:6; Dan. 9:5, 6">⚓</a>we <i>have</i> <i>been</i> very guilty, and for our iniquities <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:36; Neh. 9:30">⚓</a>we, our kings, <i>and</i> our priests have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:25">⚓</a>sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:7, 8">⚓</a>humiliation, as <i>it</i> <i>is</i> this day. </span>
<span class="verse exo_9_8"><sup>8</sup>And now for a little while grace has been <i>shown</i> from the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 34:5">⚓</a>enlighten our eyes and give us a measure of revival in our bondage. </span>
<span class="verse exo_9_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:36; Esth. 7:4">⚓</a>For we <i>were</i> slaves. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:17; Ps. 136:23">⚓</a>Yet our God did not forsake us in our bondage; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 7:28">⚓</a>He extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to revive us, to repair the house of our God, to rebuild its ruins, and to give us <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 5:2">⚓</a>a wall in Judah and Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse exo_9_10"><sup>10</sup>And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments, </span>
<span class="verse exo_9_11"><sup>11</sup>which You commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land, with the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 6:21">⚓</a>uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their impurity. </span>
<span class="verse exo_9_12"><sup>12</sup>Now therefore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 23:32; 34:15, 16; Deut. 7:3, 4); Ezra 9:2">⚓</a>do not give your daughters as wives for their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 23:6">⚓</a>never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good of the land, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 13:22; 20:7)">⚓</a>leave <i>it</i> as an inheritance to your children forever.’ </span>
<span class="verse exo_9_13"><sup>13</sup>And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, since You our God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 103:10)">⚓</a>have punished us less than our iniquities <i>deserve,</i> and have given us <i>such</i> deliverance as this, </span>
<span class="verse exo_9_14"><sup>14</sup>should we <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 5:14; 2 Pet. 2:20)">⚓</a>again break Your commandments, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 13:23">⚓</a>join in marriage with the people <i>committing</i> these abominations? Would You not be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:8">⚓</a>angry with us until You had consumed <i>us,</i> so that <i>there</i> <i>would</i> <i>be</i> no remnant or survivor? </span>
<span class="verse exo_9_15"><sup>15</sup>O Lord God of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:33; Dan. 9:14">⚓</a>You <i>are</i> righteous, for we are left as a remnant, as <i>it</i> <i>is</i> this day. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 3:19)">⚓</a>Here we <i>are</i> before You, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:17">⚓</a>in our guilt, though no one can stand before You because of this!”<br/></span>
