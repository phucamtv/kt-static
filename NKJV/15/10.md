<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>Confession of Improper Marriages</h3></div>
<span class="verse exo_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:4, 20">⚓</a>while Ezra was praying, and while he was confessing, weeping, and bowing down <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 20:9">⚓</a>before the house of God, a very large assembly of men, women, and children gathered to him from Israel; for the people wept very <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 8:1–9">⚓</a>bitterly. </span>
<span class="verse exo_10_2"><sup>2</sup>And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, <i>one</i> of the sons of Elam, spoke up and said to Ezra, “We have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 10:10, 13, 14, 17, 18; Neh. 13:23–27">⚓</a>trespassed against our God, and have taken pagan wives from the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope in Israel in spite of this. </span>
<span class="verse exo_10_3"><sup>3</sup>Now therefore, let us make <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 34:31">⚓</a>a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and those who have been born to them, according to the advice of my master and of those who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 9:4">⚓</a>tremble at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:2, 3">⚓</a>the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 24:1, 2">⚓</a>law. </span>
<span class="verse exo_10_4"><sup>4</sup>Arise, for <i>this</i> matter <i>is</i> your <i>responsibility.</i> We also <i>are</i> with you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 28:10">⚓</a>Be of good courage, and do <i>it.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_10_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Ezra arose, and made the leaders of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 10:12, 19; Neh. 5:12; 13:25">⚓</a>swear an oath that they would do according to this word. So they swore an oath. </span>
<span class="verse exo_10_6"><sup>6</sup>Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and <i>when</i> he came there, he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:18">⚓</a>ate no bread and drank no water, for he mourned because of the guilt of those from the captivity.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_10_7"> <sup>7</sup>And they issued a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the descendants of the captivity, that they must gather at Jerusalem, </span>
<span class="verse exo_10_8"><sup>8</sup>and that whoever would not come within three days, according to the instructions of the leaders and elders, all his property would be confiscated, and he himself would be separated from the assembly of those from the captivity.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_10_9"> <sup>9</sup>So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered at Jerusalem within three days. It <i>was</i> the ninth month, on the twentieth of the month; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:18; Ezra 9:4; 10:3">⚓</a>all the people sat in the open square of the house of God, trembling because of <i>this</i> matter and because of heavy rain. </span>
<span class="verse exo_10_10"><sup>10</sup>Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have transgressed and have taken pagan wives, adding to the guilt of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse exo_10_11"><sup>11</sup>Now therefore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Lev. 26:40–42); Josh. 7:19; (Prov. 28:13)">⚓</a>make confession to the Lord God of your fathers, and do His will; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 10:3">⚓</a>separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the pagan wives.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_10_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, “Yes! As you have said, so we must do. </span>
<span class="verse exo_10_13"><sup>13</sup>But <i>there</i> <i>are</i> many people; <i>it</i> <i>is</i> the season for heavy rain, and we are not able to stand outside. Nor <i>is</i> <i>this</i> the work of one or two days, for <i>there</i> <i>are</i> many of us who have transgressed in this matter. </span>
<span class="verse exo_10_14"><sup>14</sup>Please, let the leaders of our entire assembly stand; and let all those in our cities who have taken pagan wives come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of their cities, until <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:26; 2 Chr. 28:11–13; 29:10; 30:8">⚓</a>the fierce wrath of our God is turned away from us in this matter.” </span>
<span class="verse exo_10_15"><sup>15</sup>Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah opposed this, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 8:16; Neh. 3:4">⚓</a>Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite gave them support.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exo_10_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then the descendants of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, <i>with</i> certain <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 4:3">⚓</a>heads of the fathers’ <i>households,</i> were set apart by the fathers’ households, each of them by name; and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter. </span>
<span class="verse exo_10_17"><sup>17</sup>By the first day of the first month they finished <i>questioning</i> all the men who had taken pagan wives.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Pagan Wives Put Away</h3></div>
<span class="verse exo_10_18"> <sup>18</sup>And among the sons of the priests who had taken pagan wives <i>the</i> <i>following</i> were found of the sons of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 5:2; Hag. 1:1, 12; 2:4; Zech. 3:1; 6:11">⚓</a>Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah. </span>
<span class="verse exo_10_19"><sup>19</sup>And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 10:15">⚓</a>gave their promise that they would put away their wives; and <i>being</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 6:4, 6">⚓</a>guilty, <i>they</i> <i>presented</i> a ram of the flock as their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 5:6, 15">⚓</a>trespass offering.<br/></span>
