<span class="verse ne_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>The words of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 10:1">⚓</a>Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah.<br/> It came to pass in the month of Chislev, <i>in</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:1">⚓</a>twentieth year, as I was in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 1:1, 2, 5; Dan. 8:2">⚓</a>Shushan the citadel, </span>
<span class="verse ne_1_2"><sup>2</sup>that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 7:2">⚓</a>Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse ne_1_3"><sup>3</sup>And they said to me, “The survivors who are left from the captivity in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 7:6">⚓</a>province <i>are</i> there in great distress and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:17">⚓</a>reproach. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:17">⚓</a>The wall of Jerusalem <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:10">⚓</a><i>is</i> also broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_1_4"> <sup>4</sup>So it was, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned <i>for</i> <i>many</i> days; I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_1_5"> <sup>5</sup>And I said: “I pray, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:4">⚓</a>Lord God of heaven, O great and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 4:14">⚓</a>awesome God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 20:6; 34:6, 7); Ps. 89:2, 3">⚓</a><i>You</i> who keep <i>Your</i> covenant and mercy with those who love You and observe Your commandments, </span>
<span class="verse ne_1_6"><sup>6</sup>please let Your ear be attentive and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:28, 29; 2 Chr. 6:40; Dan. 9:17, 18">⚓</a>Your eyes open, that You may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You now, day and night, for the children of Israel Your servants, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 10:1; Neh. 9:2; Dan. 9:20">⚓</a>confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both my father’s house and I have sinned. </span>
<span class="verse ne_1_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 106:6; Dan. 9:5">⚓</a>We have acted very corruptly against You, and have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:15">⚓</a>not kept the commandments, the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses. </span>
<span class="verse ne_1_8"><sup>8</sup>Remember, I pray, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:33; Deut. 4:25–27; 28:63–67">⚓</a>‘<i>If</i> you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations; </span>
<span class="verse ne_1_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:39; (Deut. 4:29–31; 30:2–5)">⚓</a>but <i>if</i> you return to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 30:4">⚓</a>though some of you were cast out to the farthest part of the heavens, <i>yet</i> I will gather them from there, and bring them to the place which I have chosen as a dwelling for My name.’ </span>
<span class="verse ne_1_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:11; Deut. 9:29; Dan. 9:15">⚓</a>Now these <i>are</i> Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great power, and by Your strong hand. </span>
<span class="verse ne_1_11"><sup>11</sup>O Lord, I pray, please <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 1:6">⚓</a>let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 26:8; (Heb. 13:18)">⚓</a>desire to fear Your name; and let Your servant prosper this day, I pray, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.”<br/> For I was the king’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:21; Neh. 2:1">⚓</a>cupbearer.<br/></span>
