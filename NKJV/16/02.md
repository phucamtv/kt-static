<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Nehemiah Sent to Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse ne_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 7:1">⚓</a>King Artaxerxes, <i>when</i> wine <i>was</i> before him, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 1:11">⚓</a>I took the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never been sad in his presence before. </span>
<span class="verse ne_2_2"><sup>2</sup>Therefore the king said to me, “Why <i>is</i> your face sad, since you <i>are</i> not sick? This <i>is</i> nothing but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 15:13">⚓</a>sorrow of heart.”<br/> So I became dreadfully afraid, </span>
<span class="verse ne_2_3"><sup>3</sup>and said to the king, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:31; Dan. 2:4; 5:10; 6:6, 21">⚓</a>“May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:8–10; 2 Chr. 36:19; Jer. 52:12–14">⚓</a>the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, <i>lies</i> waste, and its gates are burned with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:10; Neh. 1:3">⚓</a>fire?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_2_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then the king said to me, “What do you request?”<br/> So I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 1:4">⚓</a>prayed to the God of heaven. </span>
<span class="verse ne_2_5"><sup>5</sup>And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may rebuild it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_2_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then the king said to me (the queen also sitting beside him), “How long will your journey be? And when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 5:14; 13:6">⚓</a>a time.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_2_7"> <sup>7</sup>Furthermore I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 7:21; 8:36">⚓</a>governors <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>region</i> beyond the River, that they must permit me to pass through till I come to Judah, </span>
<span class="verse ne_2_8"><sup>8</sup>and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he must give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel which <i>pertains</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 3:7">⚓</a>to the temple, for the city wall, and for the house that I will occupy.” And the king granted <i>them</i> to me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 5:5; 7:6, 9, 28; Neh. 2:18">⚓</a>according to the good hand of my God upon me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_2_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then I went to the governors <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>region</i> beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. </span>
<span class="verse ne_2_10"><sup>10</sup>When <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:19; 4:1">⚓</a>Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard <i>of</i> <i>it,</i> they were deeply disturbed that a man had come to seek the well-being of the children of Israel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Nehemiah Views the Wall of Jerusalem</h3></div>
<span class="verse ne_2_11"> <sup>11</sup>So I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 8:32">⚓</a>came to Jerusalem and was there three days. </span>
<span class="verse ne_2_12"><sup>12</sup>Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me; I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; nor was there any animal with me, except the one on which I rode. </span>
<span class="verse ne_2_13"><sup>13</sup>And I went out by night <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 26:9; Neh. 3:13">⚓</a>through the Valley Gate to the Serpent Well and the Refuse Gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 1:3; 2:17">⚓</a>broken down and its gates which were burned with fire. </span>
<span class="verse ne_2_14"><sup>14</sup>Then I went on to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 3:15">⚓</a>Fountain Gate and to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:20">⚓</a>King’s Pool, but <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no room for the animal under me to pass. </span>
<span class="verse ne_2_15"><sup>15</sup>So I went up in the night by the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:23; Jer. 31:40">⚓</a>valley, and viewed the wall; then I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned. </span>
<span class="verse ne_2_16"><sup>16</sup>And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the others who did the work.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_2_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then I said to them, “You see the distress that we <i>are</i> in, how Jerusalem <i>lies</i> waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 1:3; Ps. 44:13; 79:4; Jer. 24:9; Ezek. 5:14, 15; 22:4">⚓</a>a reproach.” </span>
<span class="verse ne_2_18"><sup>18</sup>And I told them of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:8">⚓</a>the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me.<br/> So they said, “Let us rise up and build.” Then they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:7">⚓</a>set their hands to <i>this</i> good <i>work.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_2_19"> <sup>19</sup>But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard <i>of</i> <i>it,</i> they laughed at us and despised us, and said, “What <i>is</i> this thing that you are doing? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 6:6">⚓</a>Will you rebel against the king?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_2_20"> <sup>20</sup>So I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 4:3; Neh. 6:16">⚓</a>but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem.”<br/></span>
