<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Nehemiah Deals with Oppression</h3></div>
<span class="verse ne_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>And there was a great <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 25:35–37; Neh. 5:7, 8">⚓</a>outcry of the people and their wives against their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 15:7">⚓</a>Jewish brethren. </span>
<span class="verse ne_5_2"><sup>2</sup>For there were those who said, “We, our sons, and our daughters <i>are</i> many; therefore let us get grain, that we may eat and live.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_5_3"> <sup>3</sup>There were also <i>some</i> who said, “We have mortgaged our lands and vineyards and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_5_4"> <sup>4</sup>There were also those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tax <i>on</i> our lands and vineyards. </span>
<span class="verse ne_5_5"><sup>5</sup>Yet now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 58:7">⚓</a>our flesh <i>is</i> as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and indeed we <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 21:7; (Lev. 25:39)">⚓</a>are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and <i>some</i> of our daughters have been brought into slavery. <i>It</i> <i>is</i> not in our power <i>to</i> <i>redeem</i> <i>them,</i> for other men have our lands and vineyards.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_5_6"> <sup>6</sup>And I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. </span>
<span class="verse ne_5_7"><sup>7</sup>After serious thought, I rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 22:25; Lev. 25:36; Deut. 23:19, 20); Ezek. 22:12">⚓</a>“Each of you is exacting usury from his brother.” So I called a great assembly against them. </span>
<span class="verse ne_5_8"><sup>8</sup>And I said to them, “According to our ability we have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 25:48">⚓</a>redeemed our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations. Now indeed, will you even sell your brethren? Or should they be sold to us?”<br/> Then they were silenced and found nothing <i>to</i> <i>say.</i></span>
<span class="verse ne_5_9"><sup>9</sup>Then I said, “What you are doing <i>is</i> not good. Should you not walk <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 25:36">⚓</a>in the fear of our God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:14; Rom. 2:24; (1 Pet. 2:12)">⚓</a>because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies? </span>
<span class="verse ne_5_10"><sup>10</sup>I also, <i>with</i> my brethren and my servants, am lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop this usury! </span>
<span class="verse ne_5_11"><sup>11</sup>Restore now to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also a hundredth of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil, that you have charged them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_5_12"> <sup>12</sup>So they said, “We will restore <i>it,</i> and will require nothing from them; we will do as you say.”<br/> Then I called the priests, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 10:5; Jer. 34:8, 9">⚓</a>and required an oath from them that they would do according to this promise. </span>
<span class="verse ne_5_13"><sup>13</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:14; Acts 13:51; 18:6">⚓</a>I shook out the fold of my garment and said, “So may God shake out each man from his house, and from his property, who does not perform this promise. Even thus may he be shaken out and emptied.”<br/> And all the assembly said, “Amen!” and praised the Lord. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:3">⚓</a>Then the people did according to this promise.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Generosity of Nehemiah</h3></div>
<span class="verse ne_5_14"> <sup>14</sup>Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:1; 13:6">⚓</a>until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 9:4–15)">⚓</a>ate the governor’s provisions. </span>
<span class="verse ne_5_15"><sup>15</sup>But the former governors who <i>were</i> before me laid burdens on the people, and took from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 11:9; 12:13">⚓</a>I did not do so, because of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 5:9">⚓</a>fear of God. </span>
<span class="verse ne_5_16"><sup>16</sup>Indeed, I also continued the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 4:1; 6:1">⚓</a>work on this wall, and we did not buy any land. All my servants <i>were</i> gathered there for the work.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_5_17"> <sup>17</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 9:7; 1 Kin. 18:19">⚓</a>at my table <i>were</i> one hundred and fifty Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from the nations around us. </span>
<span class="verse ne_5_18"><sup>18</sup>Now <i>that</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 4:22">⚓</a>which was prepared daily <i>was</i> one ox <i>and</i> six choice sheep. Also fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine. Yet in spite of this I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 5:14, 15">⚓</a>did not demand the governor’s provisions, because the bondage was heavy on this people.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_5_19"> <sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:3; Neh. 13:14, 22, 31">⚓</a>Remember me, my God, for good, <i>according</i> <i>to</i> all that I have done for this people.<br/></span>
