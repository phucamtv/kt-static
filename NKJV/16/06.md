<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Conspiracy Against Nehemiah</h3></div>
<span class="verse ne_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it happened <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:10, 19; 4:1, 7; 13:28">⚓</a>when Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall, and <i>that</i> there were no breaks left in it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 3:1, 3">⚓</a>(though at that time I had not hung the doors in the gates), </span>
<span class="verse ne_6_2"><sup>2</sup>that Sanballat and Geshem <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 26:24, 25">⚓</a>sent to me, saying, “Come, let us meet together among the villages in the plain of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 8:12; Neh. 11:35">⚓</a>Ono.” But they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 37:12, 32">⚓</a>thought to do me harm.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_6_3"> <sup>3</sup>So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I <i>am</i> doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_6_4"> <sup>4</sup>But they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_6_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand. </span>
<span class="verse ne_6_6"><sup>6</sup>In it <i>was</i> written:<br/>  It is reported among the nations, and Geshem says, <i>that</i> you and the Jews plan to rebel; therefore, according to these rumors, you are rebuilding the wall, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:19">⚓</a>that you may be their king. </span>
<span class="verse ne_6_7">  <sup>7</sup>And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, “<i>There</i> <i>is</i> a king in Judah!” Now these matters will be reported to the king. So come, therefore, and let us consult together.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_6_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then I sent to him, saying, “No such things as you say are being done, but you invent them in your own heart.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_6_9"> <sup>9</sup>For they all <i>were</i> <i>trying</i> <i>to</i> make us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will not be done.”<br/> Now therefore, <i>O</i> <i>God,</i> strengthen my hands.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_6_10"> <sup>10</sup>Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who <i>was</i> a secret informer; and he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, at night they will come to kill you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_6_11"> <sup>11</sup>And I said, “Should such a man as I flee? And who <i>is</i> <i>there</i> such as I who would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!” </span>
<span class="verse ne_6_12"><sup>12</sup>Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all, but that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 13:22">⚓</a>he pronounced <i>this</i> prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. </span>
<span class="verse ne_6_13"><sup>13</sup>For this reason he <i>was</i> hired, that I should be afraid and act that way and sin, so <i>that</i> they might have <i>cause</i> for an evil report, that they might reproach me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_6_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 13:29">⚓</a>My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these their works, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 13:17">⚓</a>prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have made me afraid.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Wall Completed</h3></div>
<span class="verse ne_6_15"> <sup>15</sup>So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth <i>day</i> of Elul, in fifty-two days. </span>
<span class="verse ne_6_16"><sup>16</sup>And it happened, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:10, 20; 4:1, 7; 6:1">⚓</a>when all our enemies heard <i>of</i> <i>it,</i> and all the nations around us saw <i>these</i> <i>things,</i> that they were very disheartened in their own eyes; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 126:2">⚓</a>they perceived that this work was done by our God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_6_17"> <sup>17</sup>Also in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and <i>the</i> <i>letters</i> <i>of</i> Tobiah came to them. </span>
<span class="verse ne_6_18"><sup>18</sup>For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 13:4, 28">⚓</a>son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 10:15; Neh. 3:4">⚓</a>Meshullam the son of Berechiah. </span>
<span class="verse ne_6_19"><sup>19</sup>Also they reported his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.<br/></span>
