<span class="verse ne_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 3:1">⚓</a>the people gathered together as one man in the open square that <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 3:26">⚓</a>in front of the Water Gate; and they told Ezra the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 7:6">⚓</a>scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded Israel. </span>
<span class="verse ne_8_2"><sup>2</sup>So Ezra the priest brought <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 31:11, 12); Neh. 8:9">⚓</a>the Law before the assembly of men and women and all who <i>could</i> hear with understanding <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:24; Num. 29:1–6">⚓</a>on the first day of the seventh month. </span>
<span class="verse ne_8_3"><sup>3</sup>Then he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:9–11; 2 Kin. 23:2">⚓</a>read from it in the open square that <i>was</i> in front of the Water Gate from morning until midday, before the men and women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people <i>were</i> <i>attentive</i> to the Book of the Law.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_8_4"> <sup>4</sup>So Ezra the scribe stood on a platform of wood which they had made for the purpose; and beside him, at his right hand, stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and at his left hand Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, <i>and</i> Meshullam. </span>
<span class="verse ne_8_5"><sup>5</sup>And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was <i>standing</i> above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 3:20; 1 Kin. 8:12–14">⚓</a>stood up. </span>
<span class="verse ne_8_6"><sup>6</sup>And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God.<br/> Then all the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 5:13; (1 Cor. 14:16)">⚓</a>answered, “Amen, Amen!” while <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 28:2; Lam. 3:41; 1 Tim. 2:8">⚓</a>lifting up their hands. And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:31; 12:27; 2 Chr. 20:18">⚓</a>bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord with <i>their</i> faces to the ground.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_8_7"> <sup>7</sup>Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 10:11; Deut. 33:10; 2 Chr. 17:7; (Mal. 2:7)">⚓</a>helped the people to understand the Law; and the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:3">⚓</a><i>stood</i> in their place. </span>
<span class="verse ne_8_8"><sup>8</sup>So they read distinctly from the book, in the Law of God; and they gave the sense, and helped <i>them</i> to understand the reading.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_8_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 2:63; Neh. 7:65, 70; 10:1">⚓</a>And Nehemiah, who <i>was</i> the governor, Ezra the priest <i>and</i> scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:24; Num. 29:1">⚓</a>“This day <i>is</i> holy to the Lord your God; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 16:14; Eccl. 3:4">⚓</a>do not mourn nor weep.” For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_8_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then he said to them, “Go your way, eat the fat, drink the sweet, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 26:11–13); Esth. 9:19, 22; Rev. 11:10">⚓</a>and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared; for <i>this</i> day <i>is</i> holy to our Lord. Do not sorrow, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_8_11"> <sup>11</sup>So the Levites quieted all the people, saying, “Be still, for the day <i>is</i> holy; do not be grieved.” </span>
<span class="verse ne_8_12"><sup>12</sup>And all the people went their way to eat and drink, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 8:10">⚓</a>send portions and rejoice greatly, because they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 8:7, 8">⚓</a>understood the words that were declared to them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Feast of Tabernacles</h3></div>
<span class="verse ne_8_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now on the second day the heads of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> of all the people, with the priests and Levites, were gathered to Ezra the scribe, in order to understand the words of the Law. </span>
<span class="verse ne_8_14"><sup>14</sup>And they found written in the Law, which the Lord had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:34, 40, 42; Deut. 16:13">⚓</a>booths during the feast of the seventh month, </span>
<span class="verse ne_8_15"><sup>15</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:4">⚓</a>that they should announce and proclaim in all their cities and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 16:16">⚓</a>in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the mountain, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:40">⚓</a>bring olive branches, branches of oil trees, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of leafy trees, to make booths, as <i>it</i> <i>is</i> written.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_8_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then the people went out and brought <i>them</i> and made themselves booths, each one on the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 22:8">⚓</a>roof of his house, or in their courtyards or the courts of the house of God, and in the open square of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 12:37">⚓</a>Water Gate <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:13; Neh. 12:39">⚓</a>and in the open square of the Gate of Ephraim. </span>
<span class="verse ne_8_17"><sup>17</sup>So the whole assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and sat under the booths; for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:21">⚓</a>great gladness. </span>
<span class="verse ne_8_18"><sup>18</sup>Also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:11">⚓</a>day by day, from the first day until the last day, he read from the Book of the Law of God. And they kept the feast <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:36">⚓</a>seven days; and on the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 29:35">⚓</a>eighth day <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a sacred assembly, according to the <i>prescribed</i> manner.<br/></span>
