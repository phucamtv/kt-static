<span class="verse ne_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>On that day <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 31:11, 12); 2 Kin. 23:2; Neh. 8:3, 8; 9:3; Is. 34:16">⚓</a>they read from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people, and in it was found written <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 23:3, 4">⚓</a>that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into the assembly of God, </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_2"><sup>2</sup>because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and water, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:5; Josh. 24:9, 10">⚓</a>hired Balaam against them to curse them. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:1; 24:10; Deut. 23:5">⚓</a>However, our God turned the curse into a blessing. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_3"><sup>3</sup>So it was, when they had heard the Law, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:2; 10:28">⚓</a>that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Reforms of Nehemiah</h3></div>
<span class="verse ne_13_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now before this, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 12:10">⚓</a>Eliashib the priest, having authority over the storerooms of the house of our God, <i>was</i> allied with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:10; 4:3; 6:1">⚓</a>Tobiah. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_5"><sup>5</sup>And he had prepared for him a large room, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 12:44">⚓</a>where previously they had stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the articles, the tithes of grain, the new wine and oil, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 18:21, 24">⚓</a>which were commanded <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>given</i> to the Levites and singers and gatekeepers, and the offerings for the priests. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_6"><sup>6</sup>But during all this I was not in Jerusalem, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 5:14–16">⚓</a>for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Then after certain days I obtained leave from the king, </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_7"><sup>7</sup>and I came to Jerusalem and discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 13:1, 5">⚓</a>preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_8"><sup>8</sup>And it grieved me bitterly; therefore I threw all the household goods of Tobiah out of the room. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_9"><sup>9</sup>Then I commanded them to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:5, 15, 16">⚓</a>cleanse the rooms; and I brought back into them the articles of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_13_10"> <sup>10</sup>I also realized that the portions for the Levites had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 10:37; Mal. 3:8">⚓</a>not been given <i>them;</i> for each of the Levites and the singers who did the work had gone back to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 35:2">⚓</a>his field. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_11"><sup>11</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 13:17, 25">⚓</a>I contended with the rulers, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 10:39">⚓</a>“Why is the house of God forsaken?” And I gathered them together and set them in their place. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 10:38; 12:44">⚓</a>Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the storehouse. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 31:12">⚓</a>And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouse Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them <i>was</i> Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 4:2">⚓</a>faithful, and their task <i>was</i> to distribute to their brethren.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_13_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 5:19; 13:22, 31">⚓</a>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its services!<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_13_15"> <sup>15</sup>In those days I saw <i>people</i> in Judah treading wine presses <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 20:10)">⚓</a>on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all <i>kinds</i> <i>of</i> burdens, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 10:31; (Jer. 17:21)">⚓</a>which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I warned <i>them</i> about the day on which they were selling provisions. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_16"><sup>16</sup>Men of Tyre dwelt there also, who brought in fish and all kinds of goods, and sold <i>them</i> on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_13_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What evil thing <i>is</i> this that you do, by which you profane the Sabbath day? </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 9:13; (Jer. 17:21)">⚓</a>Did not your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Yet you bring added wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_13_19"> <sup>19</sup>So it was, at the gates of Jerusalem, as it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:32">⚓</a>began to be dark before the Sabbath, that I commanded the gates to be shut, and charged that they must not be opened till after the Sabbath. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 17:21, 22">⚓</a>Then I posted <i>some</i> of my servants at the gates, <i>so</i> <i>that</i> no burdens would be brought in on the Sabbath day. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_20"><sup>20</sup>Now the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_13_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then I warned them, and said to them, “Why do you spend the night around the wall? If you do <i>so</i> again, I will lay hands on you!” From that time on they came no <i>more</i> on the Sabbath. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_22"><sup>22</sup>And I commanded the Levites that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 15:12; Neh. 12:30">⚓</a>they should cleanse themselves, and that they should go and guard the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day.<br/> Remember me, O my God, <i>concerning</i> this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Your mercy!<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_13_23"> <sup>23</sup>In those days I also saw Jews <i>who</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 34:16; Deut. 7:3, 4); Ezra 9:2; Neh. 10:30">⚓</a>had married women of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 4:7">⚓</a>Ashdod, Ammon, <i>and</i> Moab. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_24"><sup>24</sup>And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and could not speak the language of Judah, but spoke according to the language of one or the other people.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_13_25"> <sup>25</sup>So I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 28:4">⚓</a>contended with them and cursed them, struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 10:5; Neh. 10:29, 30">⚓</a>swear by God, <i>saying,</i> “You shall not give your daughters as wives to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or yourselves. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_26"><sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:1, 2">⚓</a>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:24, 25">⚓</a>who was beloved of his God; and God made him king over all Israel. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 11:4–8">⚓</a>Nevertheless pagan women caused even him to sin. </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_27"><sup>27</sup>Should we then hear of your doing all this great evil, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ezra 10:2); Neh. 13:23">⚓</a>transgressing against our God by marrying pagan women?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_13_28"> <sup>28</sup>And <i>one</i> of the sons <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 12:10, 12">⚓</a>of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, <i>was</i> a son-in-law of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 4:1, 7; 6:1, 2">⚓</a>Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I drove him from me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_13_29"> <sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 6:14">⚓</a>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 2:4, 11, 12">⚓</a>the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ne_13_30"> <sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 10:30">⚓</a>Thus I cleansed them of everything pagan. I also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 12:1">⚓</a>assigned duties to the priests and the Levites, each to his service, </span>
<span class="verse ne_13_31"><sup>31</sup>and <i>to</i> <i>bringing</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 10:34">⚓</a>the wood offering and the firstfruits at appointed times.<br/> <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 13:14, 22">⚓</a>Remember me, O my God, for good!<br/></span>
