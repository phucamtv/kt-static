<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Haman’s Conspiracy Against the Jews</h3></div>
<span class="verse et_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 24:7; 1 Sam. 15:8">⚓</a>Agagite, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 5:11">⚓</a>advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who <i>were</i> with him. </span>
<span class="verse et_3_2"><sup>2</sup>And all the king’s servants who <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 2:19, 21, 5:9">⚓</a>within the king’s gate bowed and paid homage to Haman, for so the king had commanded concerning him. But Mordecai <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 3:5; Ps. 15:4">⚓</a>would not bow or pay homage. </span>
<span class="verse et_3_3"><sup>3</sup>Then the king’s servants who <i>were</i> within the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why do you transgress the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 3:2">⚓</a>king’s command?” </span>
<span class="verse et_3_4"><sup>4</sup>Now it happened, when they spoke to him daily and he would not listen to them, that they told <i>it</i> to Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s words would stand; for <i>Mordecai</i> had told them that he <i>was</i> a Jew. </span>
<span class="verse et_3_5"><sup>5</sup>When Haman saw that Mordecai <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 3:2, 5:9">⚓</a>did not bow or pay him homage, Haman was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 3:19">⚓</a>filled with wrath. </span>
<span class="verse et_3_6"><sup>6</sup>But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had told him of the people of Mordecai. Instead, Haman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 83:4; (Rev. 12:1–17)">⚓</a>sought to destroy all the Jews who <i>were</i> throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus—the people of Mordecai.<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_3_7"> <sup>7</sup>In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 9:24–26">⚓</a>they cast Pur (that <i>is,</i> the lot), before Haman to determine the day and the month, until <i>it</i> <i>fell</i> <i>on</i> <i>the</i> twelfth <i>month,</i> which <i>is</i> the month of Adar.<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_3_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 4:12–15; Acts 16:20, 21">⚓</a>their laws <i>are</i> different from all <i>other</i> people’s, and they do not keep the king’s laws. Therefore it <i>is</i> not fitting for the king to let them remain. </span>
<span class="verse et_3_9"><sup>9</sup>If it pleases the king, let <i>a</i> <i>decree</i> be written that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who do the work, to bring <i>it</i> into the king’s treasuries.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_3_10"> <sup>10</sup>So the king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:42">⚓</a>took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 8:2, 8">⚓</a>his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 7:6">⚓</a>enemy of the Jews. </span>
<span class="verse et_3_11"><sup>11</sup>And the king said to Haman, “The money and the people <i>are</i> given to you, to do with them as seems good to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_3_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 8:9">⚓</a>Then the king’s scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and <i>a</i> <i>decree</i> was written according to all that Haman commanded—to the king’s satraps, to the governors who <i>were</i> over each province, to the officials of all people, to every province <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 1:22">⚓</a>according to its script, and to every people in their language. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:8; Esth. 8:8–10">⚓</a>In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written, and sealed with the king’s signet ring. </span>
<span class="verse et_3_13"><sup>13</sup>And the letters were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 30:6; Esth. 8:10, 14">⚓</a>sent by couriers into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate all the Jews, both young and old, little children and women, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 8:12">⚓</a>in one day, on the thirteenth <i>day</i> of the twelfth month, which <i>is</i> the month of Adar, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 8:11, 9:10">⚓</a>to plunder their possessions. </span>
<span class="verse et_3_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 8:13, 14">⚓</a>A copy of the document was to be issued as law in every province, being published for all people, that they should be ready for that day. </span>
<span class="verse et_3_15"><sup>15</sup>The couriers went out, hastened by the king’s command; and the decree was proclaimed in Shushan the citadel. So the king and Haman sat down to drink, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 8:15; (Prov. 29:2)">⚓</a>the city of Shushan was perplexed.<br/></span>
