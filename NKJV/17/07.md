<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>Haman Hanged Instead of Mordecai</h3></div>
<span class="verse et_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther. </span>
<span class="verse et_7_2"><sup>2</sup>And on the second day, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 5:6">⚓</a>at the banquet of wine, the king again said to Esther, “What <i>is</i> your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what <i>is</i> your request, up to half the kingdom? It shall be done!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_7_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then Queen Esther answered and said, “If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request. </span>
<span class="verse et_7_4"><sup>4</sup>For we have been <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 3:9, 4:7">⚓</a>sold, my people and I, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. Had we been sold as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:68">⚓</a>male and female slaves, I would have held my tongue, although the enemy could never compensate for the king’s loss.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_7_5"> <sup>5</sup>So King Ahasuerus answered and said to Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he, who would dare presume in his heart to do such a thing?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_7_6"> <sup>6</sup>And Esther said, “The adversary and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 3:10">⚓</a>enemy <i>is</i> this wicked Haman!”<br/> So Haman was terrified before the king and queen.<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_7_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine <i>and</i> <i>went</i> into the palace garden; but Haman stood before Queen Esther, pleading for his life, for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king. </span>
<span class="verse et_7_8"><sup>8</sup>When the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet of wine, Haman had fallen across <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 1:6">⚓</a>the couch where Esther <i>was.</i> Then the king said, “Will he also assault the queen while I <i>am</i> in the house?”<br/> As the word left the king’s mouth, they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 9:24">⚓</a>covered Haman’s face. </span>
<span class="verse et_7_9"><sup>9</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 1:10">⚓</a>Harbonah, one of the eunuchs, said to the king, “Look! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 5:14; (Ps. 7:16; Prov. 11:5, 6)">⚓</a>The gallows, fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 6:2">⚓</a>good on the king’s behalf, is standing at the house of Haman.”<br/> Then the king said, “Hang him on it!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_7_10"> <sup>10</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 7:16; 94:23; Prov. 11:5, 6)">⚓</a>they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 37:35, 36; Dan. 6:24">⚓</a>hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath subsided.<br/></span>
