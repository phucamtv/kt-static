<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>Esther Saves the Jews</h3></div>
<span class="verse et_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>On that day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 7:6">⚓</a>enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 2:7, 15">⚓</a>how he <i>was</i> <i>related</i> to her. </span>
<span class="verse et_8_2"><sup>2</sup>So the king took off <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 3:10">⚓</a>his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai; and Esther appointed Mordecai over the house of Haman.<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_8_3"> <sup>3</sup>Now Esther spoke again to the king, fell down at his feet, and implored him with tears to counteract the evil of Haman the Agagite, and the scheme which he had devised against the Jews. </span>
<span class="verse et_8_4"><sup>4</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 4:11, 5:2">⚓</a>the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king, </span>
<span class="verse et_8_5"><sup>5</sup>and said, “If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight and the thing <i>seems</i> right to the king and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to revoke the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 3:13">⚓</a>letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to annihilate the Jews who <i>are</i> in all the king’s provinces. </span>
<span class="verse et_8_6"><sup>6</sup>For how can I endure to see <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:3; Esth. 7:4, 9:1">⚓</a>the evil that will come to my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my countrymen?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_8_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, “Indeed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 8:1; Prov. 13:22">⚓</a>I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he <i>tried</i> <i>to</i> lay his hand on the Jews. </span>
<span class="verse et_8_8"><sup>8</sup>You yourselves write <i>a</i> <i>decree</i> concerning the Jews, as you please, in the king’s name, and seal <i>it</i> with the king’s signet ring; for whatever is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 1:19; Dan. 6:8, 12, 15">⚓</a>no one can revoke.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_8_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 3:12">⚓</a>So the king’s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which <i>is</i> the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third <i>day;</i> and it was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, the satraps, the governors, and the princes of the provinces <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 1:1">⚓</a>from India to Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces <i>in</i> <i>all,</i> to every province <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 1:22, 3:12">⚓</a>in its own script, to every people in their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and language. </span>
<span class="verse et_8_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:8; Esth. 3:12, 13">⚓</a>And he wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed <i>it</i> with the king’s signet ring, and sent letters by couriers on horseback, riding on royal horses bred from swift steeds.<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_8_11"> <sup>11</sup>By these letters the king permitted the Jews who <i>were</i> in every city to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 9:2">⚓</a>gather together and protect their lives—to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 9:10, 15, 16">⚓</a>destroy, kill, and annihilate all the forces of any people or province that would assault them, <i>both</i> little children and women, and to plunder their possessions, </span>
<span class="verse et_8_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 3:13, 9:1">⚓</a>on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth <i>day</i> of the twelfth month, which <i>is</i> the month of Adar. </span>
<span class="verse et_8_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 3:14, 15">⚓</a>A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province and published for all people, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. </span>
<span class="verse et_8_14"><sup>14</sup>The couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by the king’s command. And the decree was issued in Shushan the citadel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse et_8_15"> <sup>15</sup>So Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, with a great crown of gold and a garment of fine linen and purple; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 3:15; Prov. 29:2">⚓</a>the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. </span>
<span class="verse et_8_16"><sup>16</sup>The Jews had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 97:11; 112:4">⚓</a>light and gladness, joy and honor. </span>
<span class="verse et_8_17"><sup>17</sup>And in every province and city, wherever the king’s command and decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:8; Esth. 9:19">⚓</a>and a holiday. Then many of the people of the land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 18:43">⚓</a>became Jews, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:5; Ex. 15:16; Deut. 2:25; 11:25; 1 Chr. 14:17; Esth. 9:2">⚓</a>fear of the Jews fell upon them.<br/></span>
