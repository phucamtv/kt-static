<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>Job and His Family in Uz</h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>There was a man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 1:17">⚓</a>in the land of Uz, whose name <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 14:14, 20; James 5:11">⚓</a>Job; and that man was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 6:9; 17:1; (Deut. 18:13)">⚓</a>blameless and upright, and one who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 16:6)">⚓</a>feared God and shunned evil. </span>
<span class="verse giop_1_2"><sup>2</sup>And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. </span>
<span class="verse giop_1_3"><sup>3</sup>Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_1_4"> <sup>4</sup>And his sons would go and feast <i>in</i> <i>their</i> houses, each on his <i>appointed</i> day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. </span>
<span class="verse giop_1_5"><sup>5</sup>So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 8:20; (Job 42:8)">⚓</a>and offer burnt offerings <i>according</i> <i>to</i> the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:10, 13">⚓</a>cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did regularly.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Satan Attacks Job’s Character</h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_1_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 2:1">⚓</a>there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them. </span>
<span class="verse giop_1_7"><sup>7</sup>And the Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?”<br/> So Satan answered the Lord and said, “From <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Pet. 5:8)">⚓</a>going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_1_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that <i>there</i> <i>is</i> none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_1_9"> <sup>9</sup>So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? </span>
<span class="verse giop_1_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 29:2–6; Ps. 34:7; Is. 5:2">⚓</a>Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 128:1, 2; Prov. 10:22)">⚓</a>You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. </span>
<span class="verse giop_1_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 2:5; 19:21">⚓</a>But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 8:21; Mal. 3:13, 14">⚓</a>curse You to Your face!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_1_12"> <sup>12</sup>And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has <i>is</i> in your power; only do not lay a hand on his <i>person.</i>”<br/> So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Job Loses His Property and Children</h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_1_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now there was a day <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eccl. 9:12)">⚓</a>when his sons and daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house; </span>
<span class="verse giop_1_14"><sup>14</sup>and a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, </span>
<span class="verse giop_1_15"><sup>15</sup>when the Sabeans raided <i>them</i> and took them away—indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_1_16"> <sup>16</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_1_17"> <sup>17</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_1_18"> <sup>18</sup>While he <i>was</i> still speaking, another also came and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:4, 13">⚓</a>“Your sons and daughters <i>were</i> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, </span>
<span class="verse giop_1_19"><sup>19</sup>and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_1_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then Job arose, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:29, 34; Josh. 7:6; Ezra 9:3">⚓</a>tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Pet. 5:6)">⚓</a>fell to the ground and worshiped. </span>
<span class="verse giop_1_21"><sup>21</sup>And he said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 49:17; Eccl. 5:15); 1 Tim. 6:7">⚓</a>“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,<br/>   And naked shall I return there.<br/>   The Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 5:19; (James 1:17)">⚓</a>gave, and the Lord has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:16; (1 Sam. 2:6)">⚓</a>taken away;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 5:20; (1 Thess. 5:18)">⚓</a>Blessed be the name of the Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_1_22"> <sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 2:10">⚓</a>In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.<br/></span>
