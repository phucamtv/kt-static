<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Satan Attacks Job’s Health</h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>Again <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:6–8">⚓</a>there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse giop_2_2"><sup>2</sup>And the Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?”<br/> <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:7">⚓</a>Satan answered the Lord and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_2_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that <i>there</i> <i>is</i> none like him on the earth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:1, 8">⚓</a>a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 27:5, 6">⚓</a>holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 9:17">⚓</a>to destroy him without cause.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_2_4"> <sup>4</sup>So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. </span>
<span class="verse giop_2_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:11">⚓</a>But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 19:20">⚓</a>bone and his flesh, and he will surely curse You to Your face!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_2_6"> <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:12">⚓</a>And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, he <i>is</i> in your hand, but spare his life.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_2_7"> <sup>7</sup>So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with painful boils <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 1:6">⚓</a>from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. </span>
<span class="verse giop_2_8"><sup>8</sup>And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 42:6; Jer. 6:26; Ezek. 27:30; Jon. 3:6; Matt. 11:21">⚓</a>while he sat in the midst of the ashes.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_2_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_2_10"> <sup>10</sup>But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:21, 22; (Heb. 12:6; James 5:10, 11)">⚓</a>Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:22; (James 1:12)">⚓</a>In all this Job did not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 39:1">⚓</a>sin with his lips.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Job’s Three Friends</h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_2_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place—Eliphaz the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 36:11; 1 Chr. 1:36; Job 6:19; Jer. 49:7; Obad. 9">⚓</a>Temanite, Bildad the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:2; 1 Chr. 1:32">⚓</a>Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 42:11; Rom. 12:15">⚓</a>and mourn with him, and to comfort him. </span>
<span class="verse giop_2_12"><sup>12</sup>And when they raised their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:6; Neh. 9:1; Lam. 2:10; Ezek. 27:30">⚓</a>sprinkled dust on his head toward heaven. </span>
<span class="verse giop_2_13"><sup>13</sup>So they sat down with him on the ground <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 50:10; Ezek. 3:15">⚓</a>seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that <i>his</i> grief was very great.<br/></span>
