<span class="verse giop_18_3">   <sup>3</sup>Why are we counted <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 73:22">⚓</a>as beasts,<br/>   <i>And</i> regarded as stupid in your sight?<br/></span>

<span class="verse giop_18_6">   <sup>6</sup>The light is dark in his tent,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 21:17; Ps. 18:28">⚓</a>And his lamp beside him is put out.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_7">   <sup>7</sup>The steps of his strength are shortened,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 5:12, 13; 15:6">⚓</a>his own counsel casts him down.<br/></span>

<span class="verse giop_18_9">   <sup>9</sup>The net takes <i>him</i> by the heel,<br/>   <i>And</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 5:5">⚓</a>a snare lays hold of him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_18_10">   <sup>10</sup>A noose <i>is</i> hidden for him on the ground,<br/>   And a trap for him in the road.<br/></span>

<span class="verse giop_18_14">   <sup>14</sup>He is uprooted from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 11:20">⚓</a>the shelter of his tent,<br/>   And they parade him before the king of terrors.<br/></span>
