<span class="verse giop_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Job answered and said:<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_2">  <sup>2</sup>“How long will you torment my soul,<br/>   And break me in pieces with words?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_3">   <sup>3</sup>These ten times you have reproached me;<br/>   You are not ashamed <i>that</i> you have wronged me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_4">   <sup>4</sup>And if indeed I have erred,<br/>   My error remains with me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_5">   <sup>5</sup>If indeed you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 35:26; 38:16; 55:12, 13">⚓</a>exalt <i>yourselves</i> against me,<br/>   And plead my disgrace against me,<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_6">   <sup>6</sup>Know then that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 16:11">⚓</a>God has wronged me,<br/>   And has surrounded me with His net.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_7">  <sup>7</sup>“If I cry out concerning wrong, I am not heard.<br/>   If I cry aloud, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no justice.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_8">   <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 3:23; Ps. 88:8; Lam. 3:7, 9">⚓</a>He has fenced up my way, so that I cannot pass;<br/>   And He has set darkness in my paths.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_9">   <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 12:17, 19; Ps. 89:44">⚓</a>He has stripped me of my glory,<br/>   And taken the crown <i>from</i> my head.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_10">   <sup>10</sup>He breaks me down on every side,<br/>   And I am gone;<br/>   My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 17:14–16">⚓</a>hope He has uprooted like a tree.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_11">   <sup>11</sup>He has also kindled His wrath against me,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 13:24; 33:10">⚓</a>He counts me as <i>one</i> <i>of</i> His enemies.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_12">   <sup>12</sup>His troops come together<br/>   And build up their road against me;<br/>   They encamp all around my tent.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_13">  <sup>13</sup>“He<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 16:20; Ps. 31:11; 38:11; 69:8; 88:8, 18">⚓</a> has removed my brothers far from me,<br/>   And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_14">   <sup>14</sup>My relatives have failed,<br/>   And my close friends have forgotten me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_15">   <sup>15</sup>Those who dwell in my house, and my maidservants,<br/>   Count me as a stranger;<br/>   I am an alien in their sight.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_16">   <sup>16</sup>I call my servant, but he gives no answer;<br/>   I beg him with my mouth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_17">   <sup>17</sup>My breath is offensive to my wife,<br/>   And I am repulsive to the children of my own body.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_18">   <sup>18</sup>Even <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:23; Job 17:6">⚓</a>young children despise me;<br/>   I arise, and they speak against me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_19">   <sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 38:11; 55:12, 13">⚓</a>All my close friends abhor me,<br/>   And those whom I love have turned against me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_20">   <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 16:8; 33:21; Ps. 102:5; Lam. 4:8">⚓</a>My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh,<br/>   And I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_21">  <sup>21</sup>“Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends,<br/>   For the hand of God has struck me!<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_22">   <sup>22</sup>Why do you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 13:24, 25; 16:11; 19:6; Ps. 69:26">⚓</a>persecute me as God <i>does,</i><br/>   And are not satisfied with my flesh?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_23">  <sup>23</sup>“Oh, that my words were written!<br/>   Oh, that they were inscribed in a book!<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_24">   <sup>24</sup>That they were engraved on a rock<br/>   With an iron pen and lead, forever!<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_25">   <sup>25</sup>For I know <i>that</i> my Redeemer lives,<br/>   And He shall stand at last on the earth;<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_26">   <sup>26</sup>And after my skin is destroyed, this <i>I</i> <i>know,</i><br/>   That <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 17:15); Matt. 5:8; 1 Cor. 13:12; (1 John 3:2)">⚓</a>in my flesh I shall see God,<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_27">   <sup>27</sup>Whom I shall see for myself,<br/>   And my eyes shall behold, and not another.<br/>   <i>How</i> my heart yearns within me!<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_28">   <sup>28</sup>If you should say, ‘How shall we persecute him?’—<br/>   Since the root of the matter is found in me,<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_19_29">   <sup>29</sup>Be afraid of the sword for yourselves;<br/>   For wrath <i>brings</i> the punishment of the sword,<br/>   That you may know <i>there</i> <i>is</i> a judgment.”<br/></span>
