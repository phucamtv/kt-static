<span class="verse giop_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 11:1">⚓</a>Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Therefore my anxious thoughts make me answer,<br/>   Because of the turmoil within me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_3">   <sup>3</sup>I have heard the rebuke that reproaches me,<br/>   And the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_4">  <sup>4</sup>“Do you <i>not</i> know this of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 8:8; 15:10">⚓</a>old,<br/>   Since man was placed on earth,<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_5">   <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 37:35, 36">⚓</a>That the triumphing of the wicked is short,<br/>   And the joy of the hypocrite is <i>but</i> for a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Job 8:13; 13:16; 15:34; 27:8)">⚓</a>moment?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_6">   <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 14:13, 14">⚓</a>Though his haughtiness mounts up to the heavens,<br/>   And his head reaches to the clouds,<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_7">   <sup>7</sup><i>Yet</i> he will perish forever like his own refuse;<br/>   Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_8">   <sup>8</sup>He will fly away <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 73:20; 90:5">⚓</a>like a dream, and not be found;<br/>   Yes, he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 18:18; 27:21–23">⚓</a>will be chased away like a vision of the night.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_9">   <sup>9</sup>The eye <i>that</i> saw him will <i>see</i> <i>him</i> no more,<br/>   Nor will his place behold him anymore.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_10">   <sup>10</sup>His children will seek the favor of the poor,<br/>   And his hands will restore his wealth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_11">   <sup>11</sup>His bones are full of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 13:26">⚓</a>his youthful vigor,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 21:26">⚓</a>But it will lie down with him in the dust.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_12">  <sup>12</sup>“Though evil is sweet in his mouth,<br/>   <i>And</i> he hides it under his tongue,<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_13">   <sup>13</sup><i>Though</i> he spares it and does not forsake it,<br/>   But still keeps it in his mouth,<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_14">   <sup>14</sup><i>Yet</i> his food in his stomach turns sour;<br/>   It becomes cobra venom within him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_15">   <sup>15</sup>He swallows down riches<br/>   And vomits them up again;<br/>   God casts them out of his belly.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_16">   <sup>16</sup>He will suck the poison of cobras;<br/>   The viper’s tongue will slay him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_17">   <sup>17</sup>He will not see <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 36:8; Jer. 17:8">⚓</a>the streams,<br/>   The rivers flowing with honey and cream.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_18">   <sup>18</sup>He will restore that for which he labored,<br/>   And will not swallow <i>it</i> down;<br/>   From the proceeds of business<br/>   He will get no enjoyment.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_19">   <sup>19</sup>For he has oppressed <i>and</i> forsaken the poor,<br/>   He has violently seized a house which he did not build.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_20">  <sup>20</sup>“Because<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 5:13–15">⚓</a> he knows no quietness in his heart,<br/>   He will not save anything he desires.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_21">   <sup>21</sup>Nothing is left for him to eat;<br/>   Therefore his well-being will not last.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_22">   <sup>22</sup>In his self-sufficiency he will be in distress;<br/>   Every hand of misery will come against him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_23">   <sup>23</sup><i>When</i> he is about to fill his stomach,<br/>   <i>God</i> will cast on him the fury of His wrath,<br/>   And will rain <i>it</i> on him while he is eating.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_24">   <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 24:18; Amos 5:19">⚓</a>He will flee from the iron weapon;<br/>   A bronze bow will pierce him through.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_25">   <sup>25</sup>It is drawn, and comes out of the body;<br/>   Yes, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 16:13">⚓</a>the glittering <i>point</i> <i>comes</i> out of his gall.<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 18:11, 14">⚓</a>Terrors <i>come</i> upon him;<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_26">   <sup>26</sup>Total darkness <i>is</i> reserved for his treasures.<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 21:9">⚓</a>An unfanned fire will consume him;<br/>   It shall go ill with him who is left in his tent.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_27">   <sup>27</sup>The heavens will reveal his iniquity,<br/>   And the earth will rise up against him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_28">   <sup>28</sup>The increase of his house will depart,<br/>   <i>And</i> <i>his</i> <i>goods</i> will flow away in the day of His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 20:15; 21:30">⚓</a>wrath.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_20_29">   <sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 27:13; 31:2, 3">⚓</a>This <i>is</i> the portion from God for a wicked man,<br/>   The heritage appointed to him by God.”<br/></span>
