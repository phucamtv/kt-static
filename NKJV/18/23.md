<span class="verse giop_23_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Job answered and said:<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_2">  <sup>2</sup>“Even today my <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 7:11">⚓</a>complaint is bitter;<br/>   My hand is listless because of my groaning.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_3">   <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 13:3, 18; 16:21; 31:35">⚓</a>Oh, that I knew where I might find Him,<br/>   <i>That</i> I might come to His seat!<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_4">   <sup>4</sup>I would present <i>my</i> case before Him,<br/>   And fill my mouth with arguments.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_5">   <sup>5</sup>I would know the words <i>which</i> He would answer me,<br/>   And understand what He would say to me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_6">   <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 57:16">⚓</a>Would He contend with me in His great power?<br/>   No! But He would take <i>note</i> of me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_7">   <sup>7</sup>There the upright could reason with Him,<br/>   And I would be delivered forever from my Judge.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_8">  <sup>8</sup>“Look,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 9:11; 35:14">⚓</a> I go forward, but He is not <i>there,</i><br/>   And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_9">   <sup>9</sup>When He works on the left hand, I cannot behold <i>Him;</i><br/>   When He turns to the right hand, I cannot see <i>Him.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_10">   <sup>10</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 1:6; 139:1–3)">⚓</a>He knows the way that I take;<br/>   <i>When</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 17:3; 66:10; James 1:12)">⚓</a>He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_11">   <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 31:7; Ps. 17:5">⚓</a>My foot has held fast to His steps;<br/>   I have kept His way and not turned aside.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_12">   <sup>12</sup>I have not departed from the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 6:10; 22:22">⚓</a>commandment of His lips;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 44:18">⚓</a>I have treasured the words of His mouth<br/>   More than my necessary <i>food.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_13">  <sup>13</sup>“But He <i>is</i> unique, and who can make Him change?<br/>   And <i>whatever</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 115:3)">⚓</a>His soul desires, <i>that</i> He does.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_14">   <sup>14</sup>For He performs <i>what</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Thess. 3:2–4)">⚓</a>appointed for me,<br/>   And many such <i>things</i> <i>are</i> with Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_15">   <sup>15</sup>Therefore I am terrified at His presence;<br/>   When I consider <i>this,</i> I am afraid of Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_16">   <sup>16</sup>For God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:14">⚓</a>made my heart weak,<br/>   And the Almighty terrifies me;<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_23_17">   <sup>17</sup>Because I was not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 10:18, 19">⚓</a>cut off from the presence of darkness,<br/>   And He did <i>not</i> hide deep darkness from my face.<br/></span>
