<div class="title"><h1>32</h1><h3>Elihu Contradicts Job’s Friends</h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_32_1"> <sup>1</sup>So these three men ceased answering Job, because he <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 6:29; 31:6; 33:9">⚓</a>righteous in his own eyes. </span>
<span class="verse giop_32_2"><sup>2</sup>Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:21">⚓</a>Buzite, of the family of Ram, was aroused against Job; his wrath was aroused because he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 27:5, 6">⚓</a>justified himself rather than God. </span>
<span class="verse giop_32_3"><sup>3</sup>Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused, because they had found no answer, and <i>yet</i> had condemned Job.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now because they <i>were</i> years older than he, Elihu had waited to speak to Job. </span>
<span class="verse giop_32_5"><sup>5</sup>When Elihu saw that <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was aroused.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_6"> <sup>6</sup>So Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said:<br/>  “I <i>am</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:32">⚓</a>young in years, and you <i>are</i> very old;<br/>   Therefore I was afraid,<br/>   And dared not declare my opinion to you.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_7">   <sup>7</sup>I said, ‘Age should speak,<br/>   And multitude of years should teach wisdom.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_8">   <sup>8</sup>But <i>there</i> <i>is</i> a spirit in man,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:12; 4:29; (Job 35:11; 38:36; Prov. 2:6; Eccl. 2:26; Dan. 1:17; 2:21; Matt. 11:25; James 1:5)">⚓</a>the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_9">   <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 1:26)">⚓</a>Great men are not <i>always</i> wise,<br/>   Nor do the aged <i>always</i> understand justice.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_10">  <sup>10</sup>“Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me,<br/>   I also will declare my opinion.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_11">   <sup>11</sup>Indeed I waited for your words,<br/>   I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_12">   <sup>12</sup>I paid close attention to you;<br/>   And surely not one of you convinced Job,<br/>   <i>Or</i> answered his words—<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_13">   <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 9:23; 1 Cor. 1:29)">⚓</a>Lest you say,<br/>   ‘We have found wisdom’;<br/>   God will vanquish him, not man.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_14">   <sup>14</sup>Now he has not directed <i>his</i> words against me;<br/>   So I will not answer him with your words.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_15">  <sup>15</sup>“They are dismayed and answer no more;<br/>   Words escape them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_16">   <sup>16</sup>And I have waited, because they did not speak,<br/>   Because they stood still <i>and</i> answered no more.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_17">   <sup>17</sup>I also will answer my part,<br/>   I too will declare my opinion.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_18">   <sup>18</sup>For I am full of words;<br/>   The spirit within me compels me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_19">   <sup>19</sup>Indeed my belly <i>is</i> like wine <i>that</i> has no vent;<br/>   It is ready to burst like new wineskins.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_20">   <sup>20</sup>I will speak, that I may find relief;<br/>   I must open my lips and answer.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_21">   <sup>21</sup>Let me not, I pray, show partiality to anyone;<br/>   Nor let me flatter any man.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_32_22">   <sup>22</sup>For I do not know how to flatter,<br/>   <i>Else</i> my Maker would soon take me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 27:8">⚓</a>away.<br/></span>
