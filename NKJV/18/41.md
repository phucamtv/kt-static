<span class="verse giop_41_1">  <sup>1</sup>“Can you draw out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 74:14; 104:26; Is. 27:1">⚓</a>Leviathan with a hook,<br/>   Or <i>snare</i> his tongue with a line <i>which</i> you lower?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_2">   <sup>2</sup>Can you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:28; Is. 37:29">⚓</a>put a reed through his nose,<br/>   Or pierce his jaw with a hook?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_3">   <sup>3</sup>Will he make many supplications to you?<br/>   Will he speak softly to you?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_4">   <sup>4</sup>Will he make a covenant with you?<br/>   Will you take him as a servant forever?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_5">   <sup>5</sup>Will you play with him as <i>with</i> a bird,<br/>   Or will you leash him for your maidens?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_6">   <sup>6</sup>Will <i>your</i> companions make a banquet of him?<br/>   Will they apportion him among the merchants?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_7">   <sup>7</sup>Can you fill his skin with harpoons,<br/>   Or his head with fishing spears?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_8">   <sup>8</sup>Lay your hand on him;<br/>   Remember the battle—<br/>   Never do it again!<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_9">   <sup>9</sup>Indeed, <i>any</i> hope of <i>overcoming</i> him is false;<br/>   Shall <i>one</i> <i>not</i> be overwhelmed at the sight of him?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_10">   <sup>10</sup>No one <i>is</i> <i>so</i> fierce that he would dare stir him up.<br/>   Who then is able to stand against Me?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_11">   <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 11:35)">⚓</a>Who has preceded Me, that I should pay <i>him?</i><br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:5; (Deut. 10:14; Job 9:5–10; 26:6–14); Ps. 24:1; 50:12; 1 Cor. 10:26, 28">⚓</a>Everything under heaven is Mine.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_12">  <sup>12</sup>“I will not conceal his limbs,<br/>   His mighty power, or his graceful proportions.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_13">   <sup>13</sup>Who can remove his outer coat?<br/>   Who can approach <i>him</i> with a double bridle?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_14">   <sup>14</sup>Who can open the doors of his face,<br/>   <i>With</i> his terrible teeth all around?<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_15">   <sup>15</sup><i>His</i> rows of scales are <i>his</i> pride,<br/>   Shut up tightly <i>as</i> <i>with</i> a seal;<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_16">   <sup>16</sup>One is so near another<br/>   That no air can come between them;<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_17">   <sup>17</sup>They are joined one to another,<br/>   They stick together and cannot be parted.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_18">   <sup>18</sup>His sneezings flash forth light,<br/>   And his eyes <i>are</i> like the eyelids of the morning.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_19">   <sup>19</sup>Out of his mouth go burning lights;<br/>   Sparks of fire shoot out.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_20">   <sup>20</sup>Smoke goes out of his nostrils,<br/>   As <i>from</i> a boiling pot and burning rushes.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_21">   <sup>21</sup>His breath kindles coals,<br/>   And a flame goes out of his mouth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_22">   <sup>22</sup>Strength dwells in his neck,<br/>   And sorrow dances before him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_23">   <sup>23</sup>The folds of his flesh are joined together;<br/>   They are firm on him and cannot be moved.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_24">   <sup>24</sup>His heart is as hard as stone,<br/>   Even as hard as the lower <i>millstone.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_25">   <sup>25</sup>When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid;<br/>   Because of his crashings they are beside themselves.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_26">   <sup>26</sup><i>Though</i> the sword reaches him, it cannot avail;<br/>   Nor does spear, dart, or javelin.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_27">   <sup>27</sup>He regards iron as straw,<br/>   <i>And</i> bronze as rotten wood.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_28">   <sup>28</sup>The arrow cannot make him flee;<br/>   Slingstones become like stubble to him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_29">   <sup>29</sup>Darts are regarded as straw;<br/>   He laughs at the threat of javelins.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_30">   <sup>30</sup>His undersides <i>are</i> like sharp potsherds;<br/>   He spreads pointed <i>marks</i> in the mire.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_31">   <sup>31</sup>He makes the deep boil like a pot;<br/>   He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_32">   <sup>32</sup>He leaves a shining wake behind him;<br/>   <i>One</i> would think the deep had white hair.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_33">   <sup>33</sup>On earth there is nothing like him,<br/>   Which is made without fear.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_41_34">   <sup>34</sup>He beholds every high <i>thing;</i><br/>   He <i>is</i> king over all the children of pride.”<br/></span>
