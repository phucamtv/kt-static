<div class="title"><h1>42</h1><h3>Job’s Repentance and Restoration</h3></div>
<span class="verse giop_42_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Job answered the Lord and said:<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_42_2">  <sup>2</sup>“I know that You <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:14; (Matt. 19:26; Mark 10:27; 14:36; Luke 18:27)">⚓</a>can do everything,<br/>   And that no purpose <i>of</i> <i>Yours</i> can be withheld from You.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_42_3">   <sup>3</sup><i>You</i> <i>asked,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 38:2">⚓</a>‘Who <i>is</i> this who hides counsel without knowledge?’<br/>   Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 40:5; 131:1; 139:6">⚓</a>Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_42_4">   <sup>4</sup>Listen, please, and let me speak;<br/>   <i>You</i> <i>said,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 38:3; 40:7">⚓</a>‘I will question you, and you shall answer Me.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_42_5">  <sup>5</sup>“I have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 26:14; (Rom. 10:17)">⚓</a>heard of You by the hearing of the ear,<br/>   But now my eye sees You.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_42_6">   <sup>6</sup>Therefore I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 9:6; Job 40:4">⚓</a>abhor <i>myself,</i><br/>   And repent in dust and ashes.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_42_7"> <sup>7</sup>And so it was, after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is aroused against you and your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me <i>what</i> <i>is</i> right, as My servant Job <i>has.</i></span>
<span class="verse giop_42_8"><sup>8</sup>Now therefore, take for yourselves <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:1">⚓</a>seven bulls and seven rams, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 5:24)">⚓</a>go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:17; (James 5:15, 16; 1 John 5:16)">⚓</a>pray for you. For I will accept him, lest I deal with you <i>according</i> <i>to</i> <i>your</i> folly; because you have not spoken of Me <i>what</i> <i>is</i> right, as My servant Job <i>has.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_42_9"> <sup>9</sup>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite <i>and</i> Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord commanded them; for the Lord had accepted Job. </span>
<span class="verse giop_42_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 30:3; Ps. 14:7; 85:1–3; 126:1">⚓</a>And the Lord restored Job’s losses when he prayed for his friends. Indeed the Lord gave Job <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 40:2">⚓</a>twice as much as he had before. </span>
<span class="verse giop_42_11"><sup>11</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 19:13">⚓</a>all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him and ate food with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversity that the Lord had brought upon him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and each a ring of gold.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_42_12"> <sup>12</sup>Now the Lord blessed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:10; 8:7; James 5:11">⚓</a>the latter <i>days</i> of Job more than his beginning; for he had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:3">⚓</a>fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys. </span>
<span class="verse giop_42_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:2">⚓</a>He also had seven sons and three daughters. </span>
<span class="verse giop_42_14"><sup>14</sup>And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch. </span>
<span class="verse giop_42_15"><sup>15</sup>In all the land were found no women <i>so</i> beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giop_42_16"> <sup>16</sup>After this Job <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 5:26; Prov. 3:16">⚓</a>lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren <i>for</i> four generations. </span>
<span class="verse giop_42_17"><sup>17</sup>So Job died, old and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:15; 25:8; Job 5:26">⚓</a>full of days.<br/></span>
