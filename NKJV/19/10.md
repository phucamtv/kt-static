<span class="verse thi_10_1">  <sup>1</sup>Why do You stand afar off, O Lord?<br/>   <i>Why</i> do You hide in times of trouble?<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_2">   <sup>2</sup>The wicked in <i>his</i> pride persecutes the poor;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 7:16; 9:16">⚓</a>Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised.<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_3">  <sup>3</sup>For the wicked <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 49:6; 94:3, 4">⚓</a>boasts of his heart’s desire;<br/>   He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 28:4">⚓</a>blesses the greedy <i>and</i> renounces the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_4">   <sup>4</sup>The wicked in his proud countenance does not seek <i>God;</i><br/>   God <i>is</i> in none of his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 14:1; 36:1">⚓</a>thoughts.<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_5">  <sup>5</sup>His ways are always prospering;<br/>   Your judgments <i>are</i> far above, out of his sight;<br/>   <i>As</i> <i>for</i> all his enemies, he sneers at them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_6">   <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 49:11; (Eccl. 8:11)">⚓</a>He has said in his heart, “I shall not be moved;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 18:7">⚓</a>I shall never be in adversity.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_7">   <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 3:14)">⚓</a>His mouth is full of cursing and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 55:10, 11">⚓</a>deceit and oppression;<br/>   Under his tongue <i>is</i> trouble and iniquity.<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_8">  <sup>8</sup>He sits in the lurking places of the villages;<br/>   In the secret places he murders the innocent;<br/>   His eyes are secretly fixed on the helpless.<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_9">   <sup>9</sup>He lies in wait secretly, as a lion in his den;<br/>   He lies in wait to catch the poor;<br/>   He catches the poor when he draws him into his net.<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_10">   <sup>10</sup>So he crouches, he lies low,<br/>   That the helpless may fall by his strength.<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_11">   <sup>11</sup>He has said in his heart,<br/>   “God has forgotten;<br/>   He hides His face;<br/>   He will never see.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_12">  <sup>12</sup>Arise, O Lord!<br/>   O God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 17:7; 94:2; Mic. 5:9">⚓</a>lift up Your hand!<br/>   Do not forget the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 9:12">⚓</a>humble.<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_13">   <sup>13</sup>Why do the wicked renounce God?<br/>   He has said in his heart,<br/>   “You will not require <i>an</i> <i>account.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_14">  <sup>14</sup>But You have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 11:4)">⚓</a>seen, for You observe trouble and grief,<br/>   To repay <i>it</i> by Your hand.<br/>   The helpless <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Tim. 1:12)">⚓</a>commits himself to You;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 68:5; Hos. 14:3">⚓</a>You are the helper of the fatherless.<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_15">   <sup>15</sup>Break the arm of the wicked and the evil <i>man;</i><br/>   Seek out his wickedness <i>until</i> You find none.<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_16">  <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 29:10">⚓</a>The Lord<i>is</i> King forever and ever;<br/>   The nations have perished out of His land.<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_17">   <sup>17</sup>Lord, You have heard the desire of the humble;<br/>   You will prepare their heart;<br/>   You will cause Your ear to hear,<br/></span>
<span class="verse thi_10_18">   <sup>18</sup>To do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed,<br/>   That the man of the earth may oppress no more.<br/></span>
