<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>The Vanity of Pleasure</h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>I said <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 12:19">⚓</a>in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 14:13; (Eccl. 7:4; 8:15)">⚓</a>mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure”; but surely, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 1:2">⚓</a>this also <i>was</i> vanity. </span>
<span class="verse tr_2_2"><sup>2</sup>I said of laughter—“Madness!”; and of mirth, “What does it accomplish?” </span>
<span class="verse tr_2_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 1:17">⚓</a>I searched in my heart <i>how</i> to gratify my flesh with wine, while guiding my heart with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eccl. 3:12, 13; 5:18; 6:12)">⚓</a>good for the sons of men to do under heaven all the days of their lives.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_2_4"> <sup>4</sup>I made my works great, I built myself <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:1–12">⚓</a>houses, and planted myself vineyards. </span>
<span class="verse tr_2_5"><sup>5</sup>I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted all <i>kinds</i> of fruit trees in them. </span>
<span class="verse tr_2_6"><sup>6</sup>I made myself water pools from which to water the growing trees of the grove. </span>
<span class="verse tr_2_7"><sup>7</sup>I acquired male and female servants, and had servants born in my house. Yes, I had greater possessions of herds and flocks than all who were in Jerusalem before me. </span>
<span class="verse tr_2_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:28; 10:10, 14, 21">⚓</a>I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the special treasures of kings and of the provinces. I acquired male and female singers, the delights of the sons of men, <i>and</i> musical instruments of all kinds.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_2_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 1:16">⚓</a>So I became great and excelled <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 9:22">⚓</a>more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_2_10">  <sup>10</sup>Whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them.<br/>   I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure,<br/>   For my heart rejoiced in all my labor;<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 3:22; 5:18; 9:9">⚓</a>this was my reward from all my labor.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_2_11">   <sup>11</sup>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done<br/>   And on the labor in which I had toiled;<br/>   And indeed all <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 1:3, 14">⚓</a>vanity and grasping for the wind.<br/>   <i>There</i> <i>was</i> no profit under the sun.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The End of the Wise and the Fool</h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_2_12">  <sup>12</sup>Then I turned myself to consider wisdom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 1:17; 7:25">⚓</a>and madness and folly;<br/>   For what <i>can</i> the man <i>do</i> who succeeds the king?—<br/>   <i>Only</i> what he has already <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 1:9">⚓</a>done.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_2_13">   <sup>13</sup>Then I saw that wisdom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 7:11, 14, 19; 9:18; 10:10">⚓</a>excels folly<br/>   As light excels darkness.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_2_14">   <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 17:24; Eccl. 8:1">⚓</a>The wise man’s eyes <i>are</i> in his head,<br/>   But the fool walks in darkness.<br/>   Yet I myself perceived<br/>   That <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 49:10; Eccl. 9:2, 3, 11">⚓</a>the same event happens to them all.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_2_15">  <sup>15</sup>So I said in my heart,<br/>   “As it happens to the fool,<br/>   It also happens to me,<br/>   And why was I then more wise?”<br/>   Then I said in my heart,<br/>   “This also <i>is</i> vanity.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_2_16">   <sup>16</sup>For <i>there</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 1:11; 4:16">⚓</a>no more remembrance of the wise than of the fool forever,<br/>   Since all that now <i>is</i> will be forgotten in the days to come.<br/>   And how does a wise <i>man</i> die?<br/>   As the fool!<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_2_17"> <sup>17</sup>Therefore I hated life because the work that was done under the sun <i>was</i> distressing to me, for all <i>is</i> vanity and grasping for the wind.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_2_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 49:10">⚓</a>I must leave it to the man who will come after me. </span>
<span class="verse tr_2_19"><sup>19</sup>And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will rule over all my labor in which I toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also <i>is</i> vanity. </span>
<span class="verse tr_2_20"><sup>20</sup>Therefore I turned my heart and despaired of all the labor in which I had toiled under the sun. </span>
<span class="verse tr_2_21"><sup>21</sup>For there is a man whose labor <i>is</i> with wisdom, knowledge, and skill; yet he must leave his heritage to a man who has not labored for it. This also <i>is</i> vanity and a great evil. </span>
<span class="verse tr_2_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 1:3; 3:9">⚓</a>For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun? </span>
<span class="verse tr_2_23"><sup>23</sup>For all his days <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 5:7; 14:1">⚓</a>sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_2_24"> <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 3:12, 13, 22; Is. 56:12; Luke 12:19; 1 Cor. 15:32; (1 Tim. 6:17)">⚓</a>Nothing <i>is</i> better for a man <i>than</i> that he should eat and drink, and <i>that</i> his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God. </span>
<span class="verse tr_2_25"><sup>25</sup>For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I? </span>
<span class="verse tr_2_26"><sup>26</sup>For <i>God</i> gives <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 32:8; Prov. 2:6; James 1:5">⚓</a>wisdom and knowledge and joy to a man who <i>is</i> good in His sight; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and collecting, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 27:16, 17; Prov. 28:8">⚓</a>he may give to <i>him</i> <i>who</i> <i>is</i> good before God. This also <i>is</i> vanity and grasping for the wind.<br/></span>
