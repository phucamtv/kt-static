<div class="title"><h1>4</h1></div>
<span class="verse tr_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then I returned and considered all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 35:9; Ps. 12:5; Eccl. 3:16; 5:8; Is. 5:7">⚓</a>oppression that is done under the sun:<br/>  And look! The tears of the oppressed,<br/>   But they have no comforter—<br/>   On the side of their oppressors <i>there</i> <i>is</i> power,<br/>   But they have no comforter.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_4_2">   <sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 3:17, 18">⚓</a>Therefore I praised the dead who were already dead,<br/>   More than the living who are still alive.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_4_3">   <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 3:11–22; Eccl. 6:3; Luke 23:29">⚓</a>Yet, better than both <i>is</i> <i>he</i> who has never existed,<br/>   Who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Vanity of Selfish Toil</h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_4_4"> <sup>4</sup>Again, I saw that for all toil and every skillful work a man is envied by his neighbor. This also <i>is</i> vanity and grasping for the wind.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_4_5">  <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 6:10; 24:33">⚓</a>The fool folds his hands<br/>   And consumes his own flesh.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_4_6">   <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 15:16, 17; 16:8">⚓</a>Better a handful <i>with</i> quietness<br/>   Than both hands full, <i>together</i> <i>with</i> toil and grasping for the wind.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_4_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun:<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_4_8">  <sup>8</sup>There is one alone, without companion:<br/>   He has neither son nor brother.<br/>   Yet <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no end to all his labors,<br/>   Nor is his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 27:20; Eccl. 5:10; (1 John 2:16)">⚓</a>eye satisfied with riches.<br/>   <i>But</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 39:6">⚓</a>he never asks,<br/>   “For whom do I toil and deprive myself of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 2:18–21">⚓</a>good?”<br/>   This also <i>is</i> vanity and a grave misfortune.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Value of a Friend</h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_4_9">  <sup>9</sup>Two <i>are</i> better than one,<br/>   Because they have a good reward for their labor.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_4_10">   <sup>10</sup>For if they fall, one will lift up his companion.<br/>   But woe to him <i>who</i> <i>is</i> alone when he falls,<br/>   For <i>he</i> <i>has</i> no one to help him up.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_4_11">   <sup>11</sup>Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm;<br/>   But how can one be warm <i>alone?</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_4_12">   <sup>12</sup>Though one may be overpowered by another, two can withstand him.<br/>   And a threefold cord is not quickly broken.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Popularity Passes Away</h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_4_13">  <sup>13</sup>Better a poor and wise youth<br/>   Than an old and foolish king who will be admonished no more.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_4_14">   <sup>14</sup>For he comes out of prison to be king,<br/>   Although he was born poor in his kingdom.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_4_15">   <sup>15</sup>I saw all the living who walk under the sun;<br/>   They were with the second youth who stands in his place.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_4_16">   <sup>16</sup><i>There</i> <i>was</i> no end of all the people over whom he was made king;<br/>   Yet those who come afterward will not rejoice in him.<br/>   Surely this also <i>is</i> vanity and grasping for the wind.<br/></span>
