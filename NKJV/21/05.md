<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Fear God, Keep Your Vows</h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Walk <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:5; Is. 1:12">⚓</a>prudently when you go to the house of God; and draw near to hear rather <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Sam. 15:22); Ps. 50:8; Prov. 15:8; 21:27; (Hos. 6:6)">⚓</a>than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they do evil.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_2">  <sup>2</sup>Do not be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 20:25">⚓</a>rash with your mouth,<br/>   And let not your heart utter anything hastily before God.<br/>   For God <i>is</i> in heaven, and you on earth;<br/>   Therefore let your words <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 10:19; Matt. 6:7">⚓</a>be few.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_3">   <sup>3</sup>For a dream comes through much activity,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 10:19">⚓</a>a fool’s voice <i>is</i> <i>known</i> by <i>his</i> many words.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_4">  <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 30:2; Deut. 23:21–23; Ps. 50:14; 76:11">⚓</a>When you make a vow to God, do not delay to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 66:13, 14">⚓</a>pay it;<br/>   For <i>He</i> <i>has</i> no pleasure in fools.<br/>   Pay what you have vowed—<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_5">   <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 20:25; Acts 5:4">⚓</a>Better not to vow than to vow and not pay.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_6"> <sup>6</sup>Do not let your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 6:2">⚓</a>mouth cause your flesh to sin, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 11:10">⚓</a>nor say before the messenger <i>of</i> <i>God</i> that it <i>was</i> an error. Why should God be angry at your excuse and destroy the work of your hands? </span>
<span class="verse tr_5_7"><sup>7</sup>For in the multitude of dreams and many words <i>there</i> <i>is</i> also vanity. But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eccl. 12:13)">⚓</a>fear God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Vanity of Gain and Honor</h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_5_8"> <sup>8</sup>If you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 3:16">⚓</a>see the oppression of the poor, and the violent perversion of justice and righteousness in a province, do not marvel at the matter; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 12:5; 58:11; 82:1)">⚓</a>high official watches over high official, and higher officials are over them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_9"> <sup>9</sup>Moreover the profit of the land is for all; <i>even</i> the king is served from the field.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_10">  <sup>10</sup>He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver;<br/>   Nor he who loves abundance, with increase.<br/>   This also <i>is</i> vanity.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_11">  <sup>11</sup>When goods increase,<br/>   They increase who eat them;<br/>   So what profit have the owners<br/>   Except to see <i>them</i> with their eyes?<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_12">  <sup>12</sup>The sleep of a laboring man <i>is</i> sweet,<br/>   Whether he eats little or much;<br/>   But the abundance of the rich will not permit him to sleep.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_13">  <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 6:1, 2">⚓</a>There is a severe evil <i>which</i> I have seen under the sun:<br/>   Riches kept for their owner to his hurt.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_14">   <sup>14</sup>But those riches perish through misfortune;<br/>   When he begets a son, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> nothing in his hand.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_15">   <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:21; Ps. 49:17; 1 Tim. 6:7">⚓</a>As he came from his mother’s womb, naked shall he return,<br/>   To go as he came;<br/>   And he shall take nothing from his labor<br/>   Which he may carry away in his hand.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_16">  <sup>16</sup>And this also <i>is</i> a severe evil—<br/>   Just exactly as he came, so shall he go.<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 1:3">⚓</a>what profit has he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 11:29">⚓</a>who has labored for the wind?<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_17">   <sup>17</sup>All his days <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 127:2">⚓</a>he also eats in darkness,<br/>   And <i>he</i> <i>has</i> much sorrow and sickness and anger.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_5_18"> <sup>18</sup>Here is what I have seen: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 2:24; 3:12, 13; (1 Tim. 6:17)">⚓</a><i>It</i> <i>is</i> good and fitting <i>for</i> <i>one</i> to eat and drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor in which he toils under the sun all the days of his life which God gives him; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 2:10; 3:22">⚓</a>for it <i>is</i> his heritage. </span>
<span class="verse tr_5_19"><sup>19</sup>As for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eccl. 6:2)">⚓</a>every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and given him power to eat of it, to receive his heritage and rejoice in his labor—this <i>is</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 2:24; 3:13">⚓</a>gift of God. </span>
<span class="verse tr_5_20"><sup>20</sup>For he will not dwell unduly on the days of his life, because God keeps <i>him</i> busy with the joy of his heart.<br/></span>
