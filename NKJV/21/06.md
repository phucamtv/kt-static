<div class="title"><h1>6</h1></div>
<span class="verse tr_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>There<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 5:13">⚓</a> is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it <i>is</i> common among men: </span>
<span class="verse tr_6_2"><sup>2</sup>A man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 21:10; Ps. 17:14; 73:7">⚓</a>so that he lacks nothing for himself of all he desires; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 12:20">⚓</a>yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but a foreigner consumes it. This <i>is</i> vanity, and it <i>is</i> an evil affliction.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_6_3"> <sup>3</sup>If a man begets a hundred <i>children</i> and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with goodness, or <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:35; Is. 14:19, 20; Jer. 22:19">⚓</a>indeed he has no burial, I say <i>that</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 3:16; Ps. 58:8; Eccl. 4:3">⚓</a>a stillborn child <i>is</i> better than he— </span>
<span class="verse tr_6_4"><sup>4</sup>for it comes in vanity and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness. </span>
<span class="verse tr_6_5"><sup>5</sup>Though it has not seen the sun or known <i>anything,</i> this has more rest than that man, </span>
<span class="verse tr_6_6"><sup>6</sup>even if he lives a thousand years twice—but has not seen goodness. Do not all go to one <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 2:14, 15">⚓</a>place?<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_6_7">  <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 16:26">⚓</a>All the labor of man <i>is</i> for his mouth,<br/>   And yet the soul is not satisfied.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_6_8">   <sup>8</sup>For what more has the wise <i>man</i> than the fool?<br/>   What does the poor man have,<br/>   Who knows <i>how</i> to walk before the living?<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_6_9">   <sup>9</sup>Better <i>is</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 11:9">⚓</a>sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire.<br/>   This also <i>is</i> vanity and grasping for the wind.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_6_10">  <sup>10</sup>Whatever one is, he has been named <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 1:9; 3:15">⚓</a>already,<br/>   For it is known that he <i>is</i> man;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 9:32; Is. 45:9; Jer. 49:19">⚓</a>And he cannot contend with Him who is mightier than he.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_6_11">   <sup>11</sup>Since there are many things that increase vanity,<br/>   How <i>is</i> man the better?<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_6_12"> <sup>12</sup>For who knows what <i>is</i> good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he passes like <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 102:11; James 4:14">⚓</a>a shadow? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 39:6; Eccl. 3:22">⚓</a>Who can tell a man what will happen after him under the sun?<br/></span>
