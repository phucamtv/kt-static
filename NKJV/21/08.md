<div class="title"><h1>8</h1></div>
<span class="verse tr_8_1">  <sup>1</sup>Who <i>is</i> like a wise <i>man?</i><br/>   And who knows the interpretation of a thing?<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 4:8, 9; Acts 6:15">⚓</a>A man’s wisdom makes his face shine,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:50">⚓</a>the sternness of his face is changed.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Obey Authorities for God’s Sake</h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_8_2"> <sup>2</sup>I <i>say,</i> “Keep the king’s commandment <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:11; 2 Sam. 21:7; 1 Chr. 29:24; Ezek. 17:18; (Rom. 13:5)">⚓</a>for the sake of your oath to God. </span>
<span class="verse tr_8_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 10:4">⚓</a>Do not be hasty to go from his presence. Do not take your stand for an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_8_4">  <sup>4</sup>Where the word of a king <i>is, there is</i> power;<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:11, 13; Job 34:18">⚓</a>who may say to him, “What are you doing?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_8_5">   <sup>5</sup>He who keeps his command will experience nothing harmful;<br/>   And a wise man’s heart discerns both time and judgment,<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_8_6">   <sup>6</sup>Because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 3:1, 17">⚓</a>for every matter there is a time and judgment,<br/>   Though the misery of man increases greatly.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_8_7">   <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 24:22; Eccl. 6:12">⚓</a>For he does not know what will happen;<br/>   So who can tell him when it will occur?<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_8_8">   <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 49:6, 7; Job 14:5">⚓</a>No one has power over the spirit to retain the spirit,<br/>   And no one has power in the day of death.<br/>   <i>There</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 20:5–8">⚓</a>no release from that war,<br/>   And wickedness will not deliver those who are given to it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_8_9"> <sup>9</sup>All this I have seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun: <i>There</i> <i>is</i> a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death Comes to All</h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_8_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of holiness, and they were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 2:16; 9:5">⚓</a>forgotten in the city where they had so done. This also <i>is</i> vanity. </span>
<span class="verse tr_8_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 10:6; 50:21; Is. 26:10">⚓</a>Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. </span>
<span class="verse tr_8_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 65:20; (Rom. 2:5–7)">⚓</a>Though a sinner does evil a hundred <i>times,</i> and his <i>days</i> are prolonged, yet I surely know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 4:40; Ps. 37:11, 18, 19; Prov. 1:32, 33; Is. 3:10; Matt. 25:34, 41)">⚓</a>it will be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him. </span>
<span class="verse tr_8_13"><sup>13</sup>But it will not be well with the wicked; nor will he prolong <i>his</i> days, <i>which</i> <i>are</i> as a shadow, because he does not fear before God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_8_14"> <sup>14</sup>There is a vanity which occurs on earth, that there are just <i>men</i> to whom it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 73:14">⚓</a>happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked <i>men</i> to whom it happens according to the work of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 2:14; 7:15; 9:1–3">⚓</a>righteous. I said that this also <i>is</i> vanity.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_8_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 2:24">⚓</a>So I commended enjoyment, because a man has nothing better under the sun than to eat, drink, and be merry; for this will remain with him in his labor <i>all</i> the days of his life which God gives him under the sun.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_8_16"> <sup>16</sup>When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done on earth, even though one sees no sleep day or night, </span>
<span class="verse tr_8_17"><sup>17</sup>then I saw all the work of God, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 5:9; Ps. 73:16; Eccl. 3:11; Rom. 11:33">⚓</a>a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. For though a man labors to discover <i>it,</i> yet he will not find <i>it;</i> moreover, though a wise <i>man</i> attempts to know <i>it,</i> he will not be able to find <i>it.</i><br/></span>
