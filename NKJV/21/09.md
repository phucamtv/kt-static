<div class="title"><h1>9</h1></div>
<span class="verse tr_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>For I considered all this in my heart, so that I could declare it all: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:3; Job 12:10; Eccl. 8:14">⚓</a>that the righteous and the wise and their works <i>are</i> in the hand of God. People know neither love nor hatred <i>by</i> anything <i>they</i> <i>see</i> before them. </span>
<span class="verse tr_9_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:17–19; Job 21:7; Ps. 73:3, 12, 13; Mal. 3:15">⚓</a>All things <i>come</i> alike to all:<br/>  One event <i>happens</i> to the righteous and the wicked;<br/>   To the good, the clean, and the unclean;<br/>   To him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice.<br/>   As is the good, so <i>is</i> the sinner;<br/>   He who takes an oath as <i>he</i> who fears an oath.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_9_3"> <sup>3</sup>This <i>is</i> an evil in all that is done under the sun: that one thing <i>happens</i> to all. Truly the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil; madness <i>is</i> in their hearts while they live, and after that <i>they</i> <i>go</i> to the dead. </span>
<span class="verse tr_9_4"><sup>4</sup>But for him who is joined to all the living there is hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_9_5">  <sup>5</sup>For the living know that they will die;<br/>   But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 14:21; Is. 63:16">⚓</a>the dead know nothing,<br/>   And they have no more reward,<br/>   For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 7:8–10; Eccl. 1:11; 2:16; 8:10; Is. 26:14">⚓</a>the memory of them is forgotten.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_9_6">   <sup>6</sup>Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished;<br/>   Nevermore will they have a share<br/>   In anything done under the sun.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_9_7">  <sup>7</sup>Go, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 8:15">⚓</a>eat your bread with joy,<br/>   And drink your wine with a merry heart;<br/>   For God has already accepted your works.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_9_8">   <sup>8</sup>Let your garments always be white,<br/>   And let your head lack no oil.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_9_9"> <sup>9</sup>Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which He has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 2:10">⚓</a>for that <i>is</i> your portion in life, and in the labor which you perform under the sun.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_9_10"> <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Col. 3:17)">⚓</a>Whatever your hand finds to do, do <i>it</i> with your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 12:11; Col. 3:23">⚓</a>might; for <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_9_11"> <sup>11</sup>I returned <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 9:23; Amos 2:14, 15">⚓</a>and saw under the sun that—<br/>  The race <i>is</i> not to the swift,<br/>   Nor the battle to the strong,<br/>   Nor bread to the wise,<br/>   Nor riches to men of understanding,<br/>   Nor favor to men of skill;<br/>   But time and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 6:9">⚓</a>chance happen to them all.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_9_12">   <sup>12</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 8:7">⚓</a>man also does not know his time:<br/>   Like fish taken in a cruel net,<br/>   Like birds caught in a snare,<br/>   So the sons of men <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 29:6; Luke 12:20, 39; 17:26; 1 Thess. 5:3">⚓</a>snared in an evil time,<br/>   When it falls suddenly upon them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Wisdom Superior to Folly</h3></div>
<span class="verse tr_9_13"> <sup>13</sup>This wisdom I have also seen under the sun, and it <i>seemed</i> great to me: </span>
<span class="verse tr_9_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 20:16–22">⚓</a><i>There</i> <i>was</i> a little city with few men in it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built great snares around it. </span>
<span class="verse tr_9_15"><sup>15</sup>Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that same poor man.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_9_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then I said:<br/>  “Wisdom <i>is</i> better than <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 7:12, 19">⚓</a>strength.<br/>   Nevertheless <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:2, 3">⚓</a>the poor man’s wisdom <i>is</i> despised,<br/>   And his words are not heard.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_9_17">   <sup>17</sup>Words of the wise, <i>spoken</i> quietly, <i>should</i> <i>be</i> heard<br/>   Rather than the shout of a ruler of fools.<br/></span>
<span class="verse tr_9_18">   <sup>18</sup>Wisdom <i>is</i> better than weapons of war;<br/>   But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:1–26; 2 Kin. 21:2–17">⚓</a>one sinner destroys much good.”<br/></span>
