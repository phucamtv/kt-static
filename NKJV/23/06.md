<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Isaiah Called to Be a Prophet</h3></div>
<span class="verse es_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the year that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:7; 2 Chr. 26:23; Is. 1:1">⚓</a>King Uzziah died, I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:41; Rev. 4:2, 3; 20:11">⚓</a>saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His <i>robe</i> filled the temple. </span>
<span class="verse es_6_2"><sup>2</sup>Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:11">⚓</a>with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. </span>
<span class="verse es_6_3"><sup>3</sup>And one cried to another and said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 4:8">⚓</a>“Holy, holy, holy <i>is</i> the Lord of hosts;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:21; Ps. 72:19">⚓</a>The whole earth <i>is</i> full of His glory!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_4"> <sup>4</sup>And the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_5"> <sup>5</sup>So I said:<br/>  “Woe <i>is</i> me, for I am undone!<br/>   Because I <i>am</i> a man of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:12, 30">⚓</a>unclean lips,<br/>   And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips;<br/>   For my eyes have seen the King,<br/>   The Lord of hosts.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal <i>which</i> he had taken with the tongs from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 8:3">⚓</a>the altar. </span>
<span class="verse es_6_7"><sup>7</sup>And he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:9; Dan. 10:16">⚓</a>touched my mouth <i>with</i> <i>it,</i> and said:<br/>  “Behold, this has touched your lips;<br/>   Your iniquity is taken away,<br/>   And your sin purged.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_8"> <sup>8</sup>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying:<br/>  “Whom shall I send,<br/>   And who will go for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:26">⚓</a>Us?”<br/> Then I said, “Here <i>am</i> I! Send me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_9"> <sup>9</sup>And He said, “Go, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 43:8; Matt. 13:14; Mark 4:12; Luke 8:10; John 12:40; Acts 28:26; Rom. 11:8">⚓</a>tell this people:<br/>  ‘Keep on hearing, but do not understand;<br/>   Keep on seeing, but do not perceive.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_10">  <sup>10</sup>“Make <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 119:70; Mark 6:1–6; Acts 7:51; Rom. 10:1–4">⚓</a>the heart of this people dull,<br/>   And their ears heavy,<br/>   And shut their eyes;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 5:21">⚓</a>Lest they see with their eyes,<br/>   And hear with their ears,<br/>   And understand with their heart,<br/>   And return and be healed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then I said, “Lord, how long?”<br/> And He answered:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mic. 3:12">⚓</a>“Until the cities are laid waste and without inhabitant,<br/>   The houses are without a man,<br/>   The land is utterly desolate,<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_12">   <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:21; Is. 5:9">⚓</a>The Lord has removed men far away,<br/>   And the forsaken places <i>are</i> many in the midst of the land.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_6_13">   <sup>13</sup>But yet a tenth <i>will</i> <i>be</i> in it,<br/>   And will return and be for consuming,<br/>   As a terebinth tree or as an oak,<br/>   Whose stump <i>remains</i> when it is cut down.<br/>   So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:6; Ezra 9:2">⚓</a>the holy seed <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> its stump.”<br/></span>
