<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>The Sign Against Egypt and Ethiopia</h3></div>
<span class="verse es_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the year that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:17">⚓</a>Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it, </span>
<span class="verse es_20_2"><sup>2</sup>at the same time the Lord spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and remove <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 13:4; Matt. 3:4">⚓</a>the sackcloth from your body, and take your sandals off your feet.” And he did so, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 19:24; Mic. 1:8">⚓</a>walking naked and barefoot.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_20_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then the Lord said, “Just as My servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 8:18">⚓</a><i>for</i> a sign and a wonder against Egypt and Ethiopia, </span>
<span class="verse es_20_4"><sup>4</sup>so shall the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 19:4">⚓</a>king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians as prisoners and the Ethiopians as captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 10:4; Is. 3:17; Jer. 13:22; Mic. 1:11">⚓</a>with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse es_20_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:21; Is. 30:3–5; 31:1; Ezek. 29:6, 7">⚓</a>Then they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation and Egypt their glory. </span>
<span class="verse es_20_6"><sup>6</sup>And the inhabitant of this territory will say in that day, ‘Surely such <i>is</i> our expectation, wherever we flee for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 30:5, 7">⚓</a>help to be delivered from the king of Assyria; and how shall we escape?’ ”<br/></span>
