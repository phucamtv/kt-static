<div class="title"><h1>37</h1><h3>Isaiah Assures Deliverance</h3></div>
<span class="verse es_37_1"> <sup>1</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:1–37; Is. 37:1–38">⚓</a>so it was, when King Hezekiah heard <i>it,</i> that he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse es_37_2"><sup>2</sup>Then he sent Eliakim, who <i>was</i> over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. </span>
<span class="verse es_37_3"><sup>3</sup>And they said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah: ‘This day <i>is</i> a day of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 22:5; 26:16; 33:2">⚓</a>trouble and rebuke and blasphemy; for the children have come to birth, but <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no strength to bring them forth. </span>
<span class="verse es_37_4"><sup>4</sup>It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of <i>the</i> Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 36:15, 18, 20">⚓</a>reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard. Therefore lift up <i>your</i> prayer for the remnant that is left.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_37_5"> <sup>5</sup>So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. </span>
<span class="verse es_37_6"><sup>6</sup>And Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says the Lord: “Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. </span>
<span class="verse es_37_7"><sup>7</sup>Surely I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Sennacherib’s Threat and Hezekiah’s Prayer</h3></div>
<span class="verse es_37_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then <i>the</i> Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he heard that he had departed from Lachish. </span>
<span class="verse es_37_9"><sup>9</sup>And the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to make war with you.” So when he heard <i>it,</i> he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, </span>
<span class="verse es_37_10"><sup>10</sup>“Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” </span>
<span class="verse es_37_11"><sup>11</sup>Look! You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them; and shall you be delivered? </span>
<span class="verse es_37_12"><sup>12</sup>Have the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 36:18, 19">⚓</a>gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the people of Eden who <i>were</i> in Telassar? </span>
<span class="verse es_37_13"><sup>13</sup>Where <i>is</i> the king of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 49:23">⚓</a>Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_37_14"> <sup>14</sup>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse es_37_15"><sup>15</sup>Then Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying: </span>
<span class="verse es_37_16"><sup>16</sup>“O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, <i>the</i> <i>One</i> who dwells <i>between</i> the cherubim, You <i>are</i> God, You <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 43:10, 11">⚓</a>alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth.

<span class="verse es_37_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 6:40; Ps. 17:6; Dan. 9:18">⚓</a>Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear; open Your eyes, O Lord, and see; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 74:22">⚓</a>hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living God. </span>
<span class="verse es_37_18"><sup>18</sup>Truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 15:29; 16:9; 17:6, 24; 1 Chr. 5:26">⚓</a>lands, </span>
<span class="verse es_37_19"><sup>19</sup>and have cast their gods into the fire; for they <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 40:19, 20">⚓</a>not gods, but the work of men’s hands—wood and stone. Therefore they destroyed them. </span>
<span class="verse es_37_20"><sup>20</sup>Now therefore, O Lord our God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 33:22">⚓</a>save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 83:18">⚓</a>know that You <i>are</i> the Lord, You alone.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Word of the Lord Concerning Sennacherib</h3></div>
<span class="verse es_37_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the Lord God of Israel, ‘Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, </span>
<span class="verse es_37_22"><sup>22</sup>this <i>is</i> the word which the Lord has spoken concerning him:<br/>  “The virgin, the daughter of Zion,<br/>   Has despised you, laughed you to scorn;<br/>   The daughter of Jerusalem<br/>   Has shaken <i>her</i> head behind your back!<br/></span>

<span class="verse es_37_25">   <sup>25</sup>I have dug and drunk water,<br/>   And with the soles of my feet I have dried up<br/>   All the brooks of defense.’<br/></span>

<span class="verse es_37_27">   <sup>27</sup>Therefore their inhabitants <i>had</i> little power;<br/>   They were dismayed and confounded;<br/>   They were <i>as</i> the grass of the field<br/>   And the green herb,<br/>   <i>As</i> the grass on the housetops<br/>   And <i>grain</i> blighted before it is grown.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_37_28">  <sup>28</sup>“But I know your dwelling place,<br/>   Your going out and your coming in,<br/>   And your rage against Me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_37_29">   <sup>29</sup>Because your rage against Me and your tumult<br/>   Have come up to My ears,<br/>   Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:35–37; 2 Chr. 32:21; Is. 30:28; Ezek. 38:4">⚓</a>I will put My hook in your nose<br/>   And My bridle in your lips,<br/>   And I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 38:4; 39:2">⚓</a>turn you back<br/>   By the way which you came.” ’<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_37_30"> <sup>30</sup>“This <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> a sign to you:<br/>  You shall eat this year such as grows of itself,<br/>   And the second year what springs from the same;<br/>   Also in the third year sow and reap,<br/>   Plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_37_31">   <sup>31</sup>And the remnant who have escaped of the house of Judah<br/>   Shall again take root downward,<br/>   And bear fruit upward.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_37_32">   <sup>32</sup>For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant,<br/>   And those who escape from Mount Zion.<br/>   The <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:31; Is. 9:7; 59:17; Joel 2:18; Zech. 1:14">⚓</a>zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_37_33"> <sup>33</sup>“Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria:<br/>  ‘He shall not come into this city,<br/>   Nor shoot an arrow there,<br/>   Nor come before it with shield,<br/>   Nor build a siege mound against it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_37_34">   <sup>34</sup>By the way that he came,<br/>   By the same shall he return;<br/>   And he shall not come into this city,’<br/>   Says the Lord.<br/></span>

<div class="title"><h3>Sennacherib’s Defeat and Death</h3></div>
<span class="verse es_37_36"> <sup>36</sup>Then the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:35; Is. 10:12, 33, 34">⚓</a>angel of the Lord went out, and killed in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when <i>people</i> arose early in the morning, there were the corpses—all dead. </span>
<span class="verse es_37_37"><sup>37</sup>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went away, returned <i>home,</i> and remained at Nineveh. </span>
<span class="verse es_37_38"><sup>38</sup>Now it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat.
