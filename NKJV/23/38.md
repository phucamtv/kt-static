And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, went to him and said to him, “Thus says the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:23">⚓</a>‘Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_38_2"> <sup>2</sup>Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the Lord, </span>
<span class="verse es_38_3"><sup>3</sup>and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 13:14">⚓</a>“Remember now, O Lord, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart, and have done <i>what</i> <i>is</i> good in Your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:5, 6; Ps. 26:3">⚓</a>sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_38_4"> <sup>4</sup>And the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying, </span>
<span class="verse es_38_5"><sup>5</sup>“Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father: “I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; surely I will add to your days fifteen years. </span>
<span class="verse es_38_6"><sup>6</sup>I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:35–37; 2 Chr. 32:21; Is. 31:5; 37:35">⚓</a>I will defend this city.” ’ </span>
<span class="verse es_38_7"><sup>7</sup>And this <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:17, 21, 36–40; 2 Kin. 20:8; Is. 7:11">⚓</a>the sign to you from the Lord, that the Lord will do this thing which He has spoken: </span>
<span class="verse es_38_8"><sup>8</sup>“Behold, I will bring the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down with the sun on the sundial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward.” So the sun returned ten degrees on the dial by which it had gone down.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_38_9"> <sup>9</sup>This is the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_38_10">  <sup>10</sup>I said,<br/>   “In the prime of my life<br/>   I shall go to the gates of Sheol;<br/>   I am deprived of the remainder of my years.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_38_11">   <sup>11</sup>I said,<br/>   “I shall not see Yah,<br/>   The Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 27:13; 116:9">⚓</a>in the land of the living;<br/>   I shall observe man no more among the inhabitants of the world.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_38_12">   <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 7:6">⚓</a>My life span is gone,<br/>   Taken from me like a shepherd’s tent;<br/>   I have cut off my life like a weaver.<br/>   He cuts me off from the loom;<br/>   From day until night You make an end of me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_38_13">   <sup>13</sup>I have considered until morning—<br/>   Like a lion,<br/>   So He breaks all my bones;<br/>   From day until night You make an end of me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_38_14">   <sup>14</sup>Like a crane <i>or</i> a swallow, so I chattered;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 59:11; Ezek. 7:16; Nah. 2:7">⚓</a>I mourned like a dove;<br/>   My eyes fail <i>from</i> <i>looking</i> upward.<br/>   O Lord, I am oppressed;<br/>   Undertake for me!<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_38_15">  <sup>15</sup>“What shall I say?<br/>   He has both spoken to me,<br/>   And He Himself has done <i>it.</i><br/>   I shall walk carefully all my years<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 7:11; 10:1; Is. 38:17">⚓</a>In the bitterness of my soul.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_38_16">   <sup>16</sup>O Lord, by these <i>things</i> <i>men</i> live;<br/>   And in all these <i>things</i> <i>is</i> the life of my spirit;<br/>   So You will restore me and make me live.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_38_17">   <sup>17</sup>Indeed <i>it</i> <i>was</i> for <i>my</i> <i>own</i> peace<br/>   <i>That</i> I had great bitterness;<br/>   But You have lovingly <i>delivered</i> my soul from the pit of corruption,<br/>   For You have cast all my sins behind Your back.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_38_18">   <sup>18</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 6:5; 30:9; 88:11; 115:17; (Eccl. 9:10)">⚓</a>Sheol cannot thank You,<br/>   Death cannot praise You;<br/>   Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for Your truth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_38_19">   <sup>19</sup>The living, the living man, he shall praise You,<br/>   As I <i>do</i> this day;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:9; 6:7; Ps. 78:3, 4">⚓</a>The father shall make known Your truth to the children.<br/></span>
