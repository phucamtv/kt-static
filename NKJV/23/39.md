<span class="verse es_39_1"> <sup>1</sup>At <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:12–19; 2 Chr. 32:31; Is. 39:1–8">⚓</a>that time Merodach-Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered. </span>
<span class="verse es_39_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 32:25, 31; Job 31:25">⚓</a>And Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his treasures—the silver and gold, the spices and precious ointment, and all his armory—all that was found among his treasures. There was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_39_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?”<br/> So Hezekiah said, “They came to me from a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:49; Jer. 5:15">⚓</a>far country, from Babylon.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_39_4"> <sup>4</sup>And he said, “What have they seen in your house?”<br/> So Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that <i>is</i> in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_39_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: </span>
<span class="verse es_39_6"><sup>6</sup>‘Behold, the days are coming <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:13; 25:13–15; Jer. 20:5">⚓</a>when all that <i>is</i> in your house, and what your fathers have accumulated until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left,’ says the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse es_39_7"><sup>7</sup>‘And they shall take away <i>some</i> of your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 1:1–7">⚓</a>sons who will descend from you, whom you will beget; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse es_39_8"> <sup>8</sup>So Hezekiah said to Isaiah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:18">⚓</a>“The word of the Lord which you have spoken <i>is</i> good!” For he said, “At least there will be peace and truth in my days.”<br/></span>
