<span class="verse gie_7_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 17:19; 26:2">⚓</a>“Stand in the gate of the Lord’s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, ‘Hear the word of the Lord, all <i>you</i> <i>of</i> Judah who enter in at these gates to worship the Lord!’ ” </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_3"><sup>3</sup>Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 4:1; 18:11; 26:13">⚓</a>“Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:8; Mic. 3:11">⚓</a>Do not trust in these lying words, saying, ‘The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord<i>are</i> these.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_7_5"> <sup>5</sup>“For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if you thoroughly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:12; Jer. 21:12; 22:3">⚓</a>execute judgment between a man and his neighbor, </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_6"><sup>6</sup><i>if</i> you do not oppress the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:14, 15; Jer. 13:10">⚓</a>or walk after other gods to your hurt, </span>

<span class="verse gie_7_8"> <sup>8</sup>“Behold, you trust in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 5:31; 14:13, 14">⚓</a>lying words that cannot profit. </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:21; Hos. 4:1, 2; Zeph. 1:5">⚓</a>Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:3; Jer. 7:6; 19:4">⚓</a>walk after other gods whom you do not know, </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 23:39">⚓</a>and <i>then</i> come and stand before Me in this house <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:11, 14; 32:34; 34:15">⚓</a>which is called by My name, and say, ‘We are delivered to do all these abominations’? </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_11"><sup>11</sup>Has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 56:7">⚓</a>this house, which is called by My name, become a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:13; Mark 11:17; Luke 19:46">⚓</a>den of thieves in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen <i>it,</i>” says the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_7_12"> <sup>12</sup>“But go now to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 18:1; Judg. 18:31">⚓</a>My place which <i>was</i> in Shiloh, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:11">⚓</a>where I set My name at the first, and see <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 4:10; Ps. 78:60; Jer. 26:6">⚓</a>what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel. </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_13"><sup>13</sup>And now, because you have done all these works,” says the Lord, “and I spoke to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:15; Jer. 11:7">⚓</a>rising up early and speaking, but you did not hear, and I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 1:24; Is. 65:12; 66:4">⚓</a>called you, but you did not answer, </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_14"><sup>14</sup>therefore I will do to the house which is called by My name, in which you trust, and to this place which I gave to you and your fathers, as I have done to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 4:10, 11; Ps. 78:60; Jer. 26:6, 9">⚓</a>Shiloh. </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_15"><sup>15</sup>And I will cast you out of My sight, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:23">⚓</a>as I have cast out all your brethren—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:67; Hos. 7:13; 9:13; 12:1">⚓</a>the whole posterity of Ephraim.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_7_16"> <sup>16</sup>“Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:10; Deut. 9:14; Jer. 11:14">⚓</a>do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them, nor make intercession to Me; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 15:1">⚓</a>for I will not hear you. </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_17"><sup>17</sup>Do you not see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 44:17">⚓</a>The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and <i>they</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 19:13">⚓</a>pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke Me to anger. </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:16, 21">⚓</a>Do they provoke Me to anger?” says the Lord. “<i>Do</i> <i>they</i> not <i>provoke</i> themselves, to the shame of their own faces?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_7_20"> <sup>20</sup>Therefore thus says the Lord God: “Behold, My anger and My fury will be poured out on this place—on man and on beast, on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground. And it will burn and not be quenched.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_7_21"> <sup>21</sup>Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 1:11; Jer. 6:20; Hos. 8:13; Amos 5:21, 22">⚓</a>“Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat meat. </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:22; Ps. 51:16; (Hos. 6:6)">⚓</a>For I did not speak to your fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices. </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_23"><sup>23</sup>But this is what I commanded them, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:26; 16:32; Deut. 6:3">⚓</a>‘Obey My voice, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 19:5, 6); Lev. 26:12; (Jer. 11:4; 13:11)">⚓</a>I will be your God, and you shall be My people. And walk in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well with you.’ </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 81:11; Jer. 11:8">⚓</a>Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:19; Jer. 9:14">⚓</a>followed the counsels <i>and</i> the dictates of their evil hearts, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 32:33">⚓</a>went backward and not forward. </span>
<span class="verse gie_7_25"><sup>25</sup>Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have even <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:15; Jer. 25:4; 29:19; Mark 12:1–10; Luke 11:47–49">⚓</a>sent to you all My servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending <i>them.</i></span>
<span class="verse gie_7_26"><sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 11:8">⚓</a>Yet they did not obey Me or incline their ear, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:17">⚓</a>stiffened their neck. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 16:12; Matt. 23:32">⚓</a>They did worse than their fathers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_7_27"> <sup>27</sup>“Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:7; 26:2; 37:14, 15; 43:1–4; Ezek. 2:7">⚓</a>you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not obey you.

<div class="title"><h3>Judgment on Obscene Religion</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_7_28"> <sup>28</sup>“So you shall say to them, ‘This <i>is</i> a nation that does not obey the voice of the Lord their God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 5:3">⚓</a>nor receive correction. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 9:3">⚓</a>Truth has perished and has been cut off from their mouth. </span>

<span class="verse gie_7_30"><sup>30</sup>For the children of Judah have done evil in My sight,” says the Lord. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 21:4; 2 Chr. 33:3–5, 7; Jer. 32:34, 35; Ezek. 7:20; Dan. 9:27; 11:31">⚓</a>“They have set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to pollute it. </span>
