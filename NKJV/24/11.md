<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>The Broken Covenant</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_11_2"><sup>2</sup>“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; </span>
<span class="verse gie_11_3"><sup>3</sup>and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God of Israel: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 27:26; (Jer. 17:5); Gal. 3:10">⚓</a>“Cursed <i>is</i> the man who does not obey the words of this covenant </span>
<span class="verse gie_11_4"><sup>4</sup>which I commanded your fathers in the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:20; 1 Kin. 8:51">⚓</a>from the iron furnace, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:3; Deut. 11:27; Jer. 7:23">⚓</a>‘Obey My voice, and do according to all that I command you; so shall you be My people, and I will be your God,’ </span>
<span class="verse gie_11_5"><sup>5</sup>that I may establish the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:5; Deut. 7:12; Ps. 105:9; Jer. 32:22">⚓</a>oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:8">⚓</a>‘a land flowing with milk and honey,’ as <i>it</i> <i>is</i> this day.” ’ ”<br/> And I answered and said, “So be it, Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_11_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then the Lord said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: ‘Hear the words of this covenant <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:19; (Rom. 2:13); James 1:22">⚓</a>and do them. </span>
<span class="verse gie_11_7"><sup>7</sup>For I earnestly exhorted your fathers in the day I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, until this day, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 35:15">⚓</a>rising early and exhorting, saying, “Obey My voice.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_11_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:26">⚓</a>Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 13:10">⚓</a>everyone followed the dictates of his evil heart; therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded <i>them</i> to do, but <i>which</i> they have not done.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_11_9"> <sup>9</sup>And the Lord said to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 22:25; Hos. 6:9">⚓</a>“A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse gie_11_10"><sup>10</sup>They have turned back to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:11; Jer. 3:10, 11; Ezek. 20:18">⚓</a>the iniquities of their forefathers who refused to hear My words, and they have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_11_11"> <sup>11</sup>Therefore thus says the Lord: “Behold, I will surely bring calamity on them which they will not be able to escape; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 18:41; Prov. 1:28; Is. 1:15; Jer. 14:12; Ezek. 8:18; Mic. 3:4; Zech. 7:13">⚓</a>though they cry out to Me, I will not listen to them. </span>
<span class="verse gie_11_12"><sup>12</sup>Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:37; Jer. 44:17">⚓</a>cry out to the gods to whom they offer incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble. </span>
<span class="verse gie_11_13"><sup>13</sup>For <i>according</i> <i>to</i> the number of your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:13; Jer. 2:28">⚓</a>cities were your gods, O Judah; and <i>according</i> <i>to</i> the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to <i>that</i> shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_11_14"> <sup>14</sup>“So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:10; Jer. 7:16; 14:11; (1 John 5:16)">⚓</a>do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear <i>them</i> in the time that they cry out to Me because of their trouble.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_11_15">  <sup>15</sup>“What<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 50:16">⚓</a> has My beloved to do in My house,<br/>   Having <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 16:25">⚓</a>done lewd deeds with many?<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Titus 1:15)">⚓</a>the holy flesh has passed from you.<br/>   When you do evil, then you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 2:14">⚓</a>rejoice.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_11_16">   <sup>16</sup>The Lord called your name,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 52:8; (Rom. 11:17)">⚓</a>Green Olive Tree, Lovely <i>and</i> of Good Fruit.<br/>   With the noise of a great tumult<br/>   He has kindled fire on it,<br/>   And its branches are broken.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_11_17"> <sup>17</sup>“For the Lord of hosts, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 5:2; Jer. 2:21; 12:2">⚓</a>who planted you, has pronounced doom against you for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke Me to anger in offering incense to Baal.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jeremiah’s Life Threatened</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_11_18"> <sup>18</sup>Now the Lord gave me knowledge <i>of</i> <i>it,</i> and I know <i>it;</i> for You showed me their doings. </span>
<span class="verse gie_11_19"><sup>19</sup>But I <i>was</i> like a docile lamb brought to the slaughter; and I did not know that they had devised schemes against me, <i>saying,</i> “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 83:4; Jer. 18:18">⚓</a>and let us cut him off from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 27:13">⚓</a>the land of the living, that his name may be remembered no more.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_11_20">  <sup>20</sup>But, O Lord of hosts,<br/>   You who judge righteously,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:7; 1 Chr. 28:9; Ps. 7:9">⚓</a>Testing the mind and the heart,<br/>   Let me see Your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 15:15">⚓</a>vengeance on them,<br/>   For to You I have revealed my cause.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_11_21"> <sup>21</sup>“Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the men of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:1; 12:5, 6">⚓</a>Anathoth who seek your life, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 30:10; Amos 2:12; Mic. 2:6">⚓</a>‘Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord, lest you die by our hand’— </span>
<span class="verse gie_11_22"><sup>22</sup>therefore thus says the Lord of hosts: ‘Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 9:21">⚓</a>die by famine; </span>
<span class="verse gie_11_23"><sup>23</sup>and there shall be no remnant of them, for I will bring catastrophe on the men of Anathoth, <i>even</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 23:12; Hos. 9:7; Mic. 7:4">⚓</a>the year of their punishment.’ ”<br/></span>
