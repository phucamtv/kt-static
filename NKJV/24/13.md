<div class="title"><h1>13</h1><h3>Symbol of the Linen Sash</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>Thus the Lord said to me: “Go and get yourself a linen sash, and put it around your waist, but do not put it in water.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_13_2"><sup>2</sup>So I got a sash according to the word of the Lord, and put <i>it</i> around my waist.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_13_3"> <sup>3</sup>And the word of the Lord came to me the second time, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_13_4"><sup>4</sup>“Take the sash that you acquired, which <i>is</i> around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole in the rock.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_13_5"><sup>5</sup>So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_13_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now it came to pass after many days that the Lord said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there the sash which I commanded you to hide there.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_13_7"><sup>7</sup>Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and I took the sash from the place where I had hidden it; and there was the sash, ruined. It was profitable for nothing.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_13_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_13_9"><sup>9</sup>“Thus says the Lord: ‘In this manner <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:19">⚓</a>I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 2:10–17; 23:9); Zeph. 3:11">⚓</a>pride of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse gie_13_10"><sup>10</sup>This evil people, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 16:12">⚓</a>refuse to hear My words, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:24; 16:12">⚓</a>follow the dictates of their hearts, and walk after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be just like this sash which is profitable for nothing. </span>
<span class="verse gie_13_11"><sup>11</sup>For as the sash clings to the waist of a man, so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to Me,’ says the Lord, ‘that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 19:5, 6; Deut. 32:10, 11)">⚓</a>they may become My people, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 33:9">⚓</a>for renown, for praise, and for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 43:21">⚓</a>glory; but they would <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 81:11; Jer. 7:13, 24, 26">⚓</a>not hear.’<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Symbol of the Wine Bottles</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_13_12"> <sup>12</sup>“Therefore you shall speak to them this word: ‘Thus says the Lord God of Israel: “Every bottle shall be filled with wine.” ’<br/> And they will say to you, ‘Do we not certainly know that every bottle will be filled with wine?’<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_13_13"> <sup>13</sup>“Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord: “Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land—even the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 60:3; 75:8; Is. 51:17; 63:6; Jer. 25:27; 51:7, 57">⚓</a>with drunkenness! </span>
<span class="verse gie_13_14"><sup>14</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:17; Ps. 2:9; Is. 9:20, 21; Jer. 19:9–11">⚓</a>I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together,” says the Lord. “I will not pity nor spare nor have mercy, but will destroy them.” ’ ”<br/></span>
