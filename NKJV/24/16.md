<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>Jeremiah’s Life-Style and Message</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>The word of the Lord also came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_16_2"><sup>2</sup>“You shall not take a wife, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_16_3"><sup>3</sup>For thus says the Lord concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bore them and their fathers who begot them in this land: </span>
<span class="verse gie_16_4"><sup>4</sup>“They shall die <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 15:2">⚓</a>gruesome deaths; they shall not be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 22:18; 25:33">⚓</a>lamented nor shall they be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 14:16; 19:11">⚓</a>buried, <i>but</i> they shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 83:10; Jer. 8:2; 9:22">⚓</a>like refuse on the face of the earth. They shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, and their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 79:2; Is. 18:6; Jer. 7:33; 34:20">⚓</a>corpses shall be meat for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_16_5"> <sup>5</sup>For thus says the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 24:17, 22, 23">⚓</a>“Do not enter the house of mourning, nor go to lament or bemoan them; for I have taken away My peace from this people,” says the Lord, “lovingkindness and mercies. </span>
<span class="verse gie_16_6"><sup>6</sup>Both the great and the small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 22:18">⚓</a>neither shall men lament for them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:28; Deut. 14:1; Jer. 41:5; 47:5">⚓</a>cut themselves, nor <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 22:12; Jer. 7:29">⚓</a>make themselves bald for them. </span>
<span class="verse gie_16_7"><sup>7</sup>Nor shall <i>men</i> break <i>bread</i> in mourning for them, to comfort them for the dead; nor shall <i>men</i> give them the cup of consolation to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 31:6">⚓</a>drink for their father or their mother. </span>
<span class="verse gie_16_8"><sup>8</sup>Also you shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and drink.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_16_9"> <sup>9</sup>For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 24:7, 8; Jer. 7:34; 25:10; Ezek. 26:13; Hos. 2:11; Rev. 18:23">⚓</a>I will cause to cease from this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_16_10"> <sup>10</sup>“And it shall be, when you show this people all these words, and they say to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:24; 1 Kin. 9:8; Jer. 5:19">⚓</a>‘Why has the Lord pronounced all this great disaster against us? Or what <i>is</i> our iniquity? Or what <i>is</i> our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God?’ </span>
<span class="verse gie_16_11"><sup>11</sup>then you shall say to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:25; 1 Kin. 9:9; 2 Chr. 7:22; Neh. 9:26–29; Jer. 22:9">⚓</a>‘Because your fathers have forsaken Me,’ says the Lord; ‘they have walked after other gods and have served them and worshiped them, and have forsaken Me and not kept My law. </span>
<span class="verse gie_16_12"><sup>12</sup>And you have done <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:26">⚓</a>worse than your fathers, for behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 3:17; 18:12">⚓</a>each one follows the dictates of his own evil heart, so that no one listens to Me. </span>
<span class="verse gie_16_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:26; 28:36, 63">⚓</a>Therefore I will cast you out of this land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 15:14">⚓</a>into a land that you do not know, neither you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods day and night, where I will not show you favor.’<br/></span>

<span class="verse gie_16_14"> <sup>14</sup>“Therefore behold, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 43:18; Jer. 23:7, 8; (Ezek. 37:21–25)">⚓</a>days are coming,” says the Lord, “that it shall no more be said, ‘The Lord lives who brought up the children of Israel from the land of Egypt,’ </span>
<span class="verse gie_16_15"><sup>15</sup>but, ‘The Lord lives who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 3:18">⚓</a>north and from all the lands where He had driven them.’ For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 24:6; 30:3; 32:37">⚓</a>I will bring them back into their land which I gave to their fathers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_16_16"> <sup>16</sup>“Behold, I will send for many <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 4:2; Hab. 1:15">⚓</a>fishermen,” says the Lord, “and they shall fish them; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks. </span>

<span class="verse gie_16_18"><sup>18</sup>And first I will repay <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 40:2; Jer. 17:18; Rev. 18:6">⚓</a>double for their iniquity and their sin, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ezek. 43:7)">⚓</a>they have defiled My land; they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable idols.”<br/></span>
