<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>The Potter and the Clay</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying: </span>
<span class="verse gie_18_2"><sup>2</sup>“Arise and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you to hear My words.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_18_3"><sup>3</sup>Then I went down to the potter’s house, and there he was, making something at the wheel. </span>
<span class="verse gie_18_4"><sup>4</sup>And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter; so he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_18_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </span>
<span class="verse gie_18_6"><sup>6</sup>“O house of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 45:9; Rom. 9:20, 21">⚓</a>can I not do with you as this potter?” says the Lord. “Look, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 64:8">⚓</a>as the clay <i>is</i> in the potter’s hand, so <i>are</i> you in My hand, O house of Israel! </span>
<span class="verse gie_18_7"><sup>7</sup>The instant I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:10">⚓</a>pluck up, to pull down, and to destroy <i>it,</i></span>
<span class="verse gie_18_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:3–7; 12:16; (Ezek. 18:21; 33:11)">⚓</a>if that nation against whom I have spoken turns from its evil, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 106:45); Jer. 26:3; (Hos. 11:8; Joel 2:13); Jon. 3:10">⚓</a>I will relent of the disaster that I thought to bring upon it. </span>
<span class="verse gie_18_9"><sup>9</sup>And the instant I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant <i>it,</i></span>
<span class="verse gie_18_10"><sup>10</sup>if it does evil in My sight so that it does not obey My voice, then I will relent concerning the good with which I said I would benefit it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_18_11"> <sup>11</sup>“Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord: “Behold, I am fashioning a disaster and devising a plan against you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:13; Is. 1:16–19; Jer. 4:1; Acts 26:20">⚓</a>Return now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:3–7">⚓</a>good.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>God’s Warning Rejected</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_18_12"> <sup>12</sup>And they said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 57:10; Jer. 2:25">⚓</a>“That is hopeless! So we will walk according to our own plans, and we will every one obey the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 3:17; 23:17">⚓</a>dictates of his evil heart.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_18_13"> <sup>13</sup>Therefore thus says the Lord:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 66:8; Jer. 2:10, 11; 1 Cor. 5:1">⚓</a>“Ask now among the Gentiles,<br/>   Who has heard such things?<br/>   The virgin of Israel has done <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 5:30; Hos. 6:10">⚓</a>a very horrible thing.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_18_14">   <sup>14</sup>Will <i>a</i> <i>man</i> leave the snow water of Lebanon,<br/>   <i>Which</i> <i>comes</i> from the rock of the field?<br/>   Will the cold flowing waters be forsaken for strange waters?<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_18_15">   <sup>15</sup>“Because My people have forgotten <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 2:13, 32">⚓</a>Me,<br/>   They have burned incense to worthless idols.<br/>   And they have caused themselves to stumble in their ways,<br/>   <i>From</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 6:16">⚓</a>ancient paths,<br/>   To walk in pathways and not on a highway,<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_18_16">   <sup>16</sup>To make their land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 19:8">⚓</a>desolate <i>and</i> a perpetual <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:8; Lam. 2:15; Mic. 6:16">⚓</a>hissing;<br/>   Everyone who passes by it will be astonished<br/>   And shake his head.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_18_17">   <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 13:24">⚓</a>I will scatter them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 48:7">⚓</a>as with an east wind before the enemy;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 2:27">⚓</a>I will show them the back and not the face<br/>   In the day of their calamity.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jeremiah Persecuted</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_18_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then they said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 11:19">⚓</a>“Come and let us devise plans against Jeremiah; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 10:11; Mal. 2:7; (John 7:48)">⚓</a>for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come and let us attack him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_18_19">  <sup>19</sup>Give heed to me, O Lord,<br/>   And listen to the voice of those who contend with me!<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_18_20">   <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 109:4">⚓</a>Shall evil be repaid for good?<br/>   For they have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 35:7; 57:6; Jer. 5:26">⚓</a>dug a pit for my life.<br/>   Remember that I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 14:7—15:1">⚓</a>stood before You<br/>   To speak good for them,<br/>   To turn away Your wrath from them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_18_21">   <sup>21</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 109:9–20; Jer. 11:22; 14:16">⚓</a>deliver up their children to the famine,<br/>   And pour out their <i>blood</i><br/>   By the force of the sword;<br/>   Let their wives <i>become</i> widows<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 15:7, 8; Ezek. 22:25">⚓</a>bereaved of their children.<br/>   Let their men be put to death,<br/>   Their young men <i>be</i> slain<br/>   By the sword in battle.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_18_22">   <sup>22</sup>Let a cry be heard from their houses,<br/>   When You bring a troop suddenly upon them;<br/>   For they have dug a pit to take me,<br/>   And hidden snares for my feet.<br/></span>
