<span class="verse gie_20_2"><sup>2</sup>Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that <i>were</i> in the high <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 37:13; Zech. 14:10">⚓</a>gate of Benjamin, which <i>was</i> by the house of the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_20_3"> <sup>3</sup>And it happened on the next day that Pashhur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “The Lord has not called your name Pashhur, but Magor-Missabib. </span>
<span class="verse gie_20_4"><sup>4</sup>For thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see <i>it.</i> I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:4–10">⚓</a>give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon and slay them with the sword. </span>
<span class="verse gie_20_5"><sup>5</sup>Moreover I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:17; 2 Chr. 36:10; Jer. 3:24; 27:21, 22">⚓</a>will deliver all the wealth of this city, all its produce, and all its precious things; all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give into the hand of their enemies, who will plunder them, seize them, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 39:6">⚓</a>carry them to Babylon. </span>
<span class="verse gie_20_6"><sup>6</sup>And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. You shall go to Babylon, and there you shall die, and be buried there, you and all your friends, to whom you have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 14:13–15; Lam. 2:14">⚓</a>prophesied lies.’ ”<br/></span>
