<div class="title"><h1>24</h1><h3>The Sign of Two Baskets of Figs</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_24_1"> <sup>1</sup>The <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 7:1, 4; 8:1">⚓</a>Lord showed me, and there were two baskets of figs set before the temple of the Lord, after Nebuchadnezzar <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:12–16; 2 Chr. 36:10">⚓</a>king of Babylon had carried away captive <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 22:24–28; 29:2">⚓</a>Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. </span>
<span class="verse gie_24_2"><sup>2</sup>One basket <i>had</i> very good figs, like the figs <i>that</i> <i>are</i> first ripe; and the other basket <i>had</i> very bad figs which could not be eaten, they were so <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 5:4, 7; Jer. 29:17">⚓</a>bad. </span>
<span class="verse gie_24_3"><sup>3</sup>Then the Lord said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”<br/> And I said, “Figs, the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_24_4"> <sup>4</sup>Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_24_5"><sup>5</sup>“Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: ‘Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge those who are carried away captive from Judah, whom I have sent out of this place for <i>their</i> <i>own</i> good, into the land of the Chaldeans. </span>
<span class="verse gie_24_6"><sup>6</sup>For I will set My eyes on them for good, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 12:15; 29:10; Ezek. 11:17">⚓</a>I will bring them back to this land; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 32:41; 33:7; 42:10">⚓</a>I will build them and not pull <i>them</i> down, and I will plant them and not pluck <i>them</i> up. </span>
<span class="verse gie_24_7"><sup>7</sup>Then I will give them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 30:6; Jer. 32:39; Ezek. 11:19; 36:26, 27)">⚓</a>a heart to know Me, that I <i>am</i> the Lord; and they shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 51:16; Jer. 30:22; 31:33; 32:38; Ezek. 14:11; Zech. 8:8; (Heb. 8:10)">⚓</a>My people, and I will be their God, for they shall return to Me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 7:3; Ps. 119:2; Jer. 29:13">⚓</a>with their whole heart.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_24_8"> <sup>8</sup>‘And as the bad <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 29:17">⚓</a>figs which cannot be eaten, they are so bad’—surely thus says the Lord—‘so will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, his princes, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:9">⚓</a>residue of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 44:1, 26–30">⚓</a>those who dwell in the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse gie_24_9"><sup>9</sup>I will deliver them to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:25, 37; 1 Kin. 9:7; 2 Chr. 7:20; Jer. 15:4; 29:18; 34:17">⚓</a>trouble into all the kingdoms of the earth, for <i>their</i> harm, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 44:13, 14">⚓</a><i>to</i> <i>be</i> a reproach and a byword, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them. </span>
<span class="verse gie_24_10"><sup>10</sup>And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence among them, till they are consumed from the land that I gave to them and their fathers.’ ”<br/></span>
