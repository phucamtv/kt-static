<div class="title"><h1>26</h1><h3>Jeremiah Saved from Death</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_26_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the Lord, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_2"><sup>2</sup>“Thus says the Lord: ‘Stand in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 24:20, 21; Jer. 19:14">⚓</a>the court of the Lord’s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship <i>in</i> the Lord’s house, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:2; Jer. 43:1; Ezek. 3:10; Matt. 28:20; (Rev. 22:19)">⚓</a>all the words that I command you to speak to them. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:27">⚓</a>Do not diminish a word. </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 1:16–19; Jer. 36:3–7">⚓</a>Perhaps everyone will listen and turn from his evil way, that I may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 18:8; Jon. 3:9">⚓</a>relent concerning the calamity which I purpose to bring on them because of the evil of their doings.’ </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_4"><sup>4</sup>And you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:14, 15; Deut. 28:15; 1 Kin. 9:6; Is. 1:20; Jer. 17:27; 22:5">⚓</a>“If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My law which I have set before you, </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_5"><sup>5</sup>to heed the words of My servants the prophets <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 25:4; 29:19">⚓</a>whom I sent to you, both rising up early and sending <i>them</i> (but you have not heeded), </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_6"><sup>6</sup>then I will make this house like <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 4:10, 11; Ps. 78:60; Jer. 7:12, 14">⚓</a>Shiloh, and will make this city <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 22:19; Is. 65:15; Jer. 24:9">⚓</a>a curse to all the nations of the earth.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_26_7"> <sup>7</sup>So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_8"><sup>8</sup>Now it happened, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded <i>him</i> to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, “You will surely die! </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_9"><sup>9</sup>Why have you prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, ‘This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 9:11">⚓</a>desolate, without an inhabitant’?” And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_26_10"> <sup>10</sup>When the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the house of the Lord and sat down in the entry of the New Gate of the Lord’s <i>house.</i></span>
<span class="verse gie_26_11"><sup>11</sup>And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and all the people, saying, “This man deserves to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 38:4">⚓</a>die! For he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_26_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and all the people, saying: “The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city with all the words that you have heard. </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_13"><sup>13</sup>Now therefore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:3; (Joel 2:13); Jon. 3:8">⚓</a>amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the Lord your God; then the Lord will relent concerning the doom that He has pronounced against you. </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_14"><sup>14</sup>As for me, here <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 38:5">⚓</a>I am, in your hand; do with me as seems good and proper to you. </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_15"><sup>15</sup>But know for certain that if you put me to death, you will surely bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants; for truly the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_26_16"> <sup>16</sup>So the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man does not deserve to die. For he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_26_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:34">⚓</a>Then certain of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying: </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mic. 1:1">⚓</a>“Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mic. 3:12">⚓</a>“Zion shall be plowed <i>like</i> a field,<br/>   Jerusalem shall become <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 4:2; Ps. 79:1; Jer. 9:11">⚓</a>heaps of ruins,<br/>   And the mountain of the temple<br/>   Like the bare hills of the forest.” ’<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_26_19"> <sup>19</sup>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah ever put him to death? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 32:26; Is. 37:1, 4, 15–20">⚓</a>Did he not fear the Lord and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:1–19">⚓</a>seek the Lord’s favor? And the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:14; 2 Sam. 24:16; Jer. 18:8">⚓</a>relented concerning the doom which He had pronounced against them. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 5:39)">⚓</a>But we are doing great evil against ourselves.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_26_20"> <sup>20</sup>Now there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the Lord, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath Jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah. </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_21"><sup>21</sup>And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Urijah heard <i>it,</i> he was afraid and fled, and went to Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_22"><sup>22</sup>Then Jehoiakim the king sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor, and <i>other</i> men <i>who</i> <i>went</i> with him to Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse gie_26_23"><sup>23</sup>And they brought Urijah from Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_26_24"> <sup>24</sup>Nevertheless <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 22:12–14; Jer. 39:14; 40:5–7">⚓</a>the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.<br/></span>
