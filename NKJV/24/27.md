<span class="verse gie_27_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 27:3, 12, 20; 28:1">⚓</a>king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_2"><sup>2</sup>“Thus says the Lord to me: ‘Make for yourselves bonds and yokes, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 28:10, 12; Ezek. 4:1; 12:3; 24:3">⚓</a>and put them on your neck, </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_3"><sup>3</sup>and send them to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_4"><sup>4</sup>And command them to say to their masters, “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel—thus you shall say to your masters: </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 115:15; 146:6; Is. 45:12">⚓</a>‘I have made the earth, the man and the beast that <i>are</i> on the ground, by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:29; Ps. 115:16; Jer. 32:17; Dan. 4:17, 25, 32">⚓</a>have given it to whom it seemed proper to Me. </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 28:14">⚓</a>And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 25:9; 43:10; Ezek. 29:18, 20">⚓</a>My servant; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 28:14; Dan. 2:38">⚓</a>the beasts of the field I have also given him to serve him. </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:20">⚓</a>So all nations shall serve him and his son and his son’s son, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 25:12; 50:27; (Dan. 5:26); Zech. 2:8, 9">⚓</a>until the time of his land comes; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 25:14">⚓</a>and then many nations and great kings shall make him serve them. </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_8"><sup>8</sup>And it shall be, <i>that</i> the nation and kingdom which will not serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and which will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish,’ says the Lord, ‘with the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_9"><sup>9</sup>Therefore do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers, or your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, “You shall not serve the king of Babylon.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_10"><sup>10</sup>For they prophesy a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 23:16, 32; 28:15">⚓</a>lie to you, to remove you far from your land; and I will drive you out, and you will perish. </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_11"><sup>11</sup>But the nations that bring their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let them remain in their own land,’ says the Lord, ‘and they shall till it and dwell in it.’ ” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_27_12"> <sup>12</sup>I also spoke to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 28:1; 38:17">⚓</a>Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live! </span>

<span class="verse gie_27_14"><sup>14</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 23:16">⚓</a>do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they prophesy <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 14:14; 23:21; 29:8, 9; Ezek. 13:22">⚓</a>a lie to you; </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_15"><sup>15</sup>for I have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 23:21; 29:9">⚓</a>not sent them,” says the Lord, “yet they prophesy a lie in My name, that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_27_16"> <sup>16</sup>Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says the Lord: ‘Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, “Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:13; 2 Chr. 36:7, 10; Jer. 28:3; Dan. 1:2">⚓</a>the vessels of the Lord’s house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon”; for they prophesy a lie to you. </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_17"><sup>17</sup>Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should this city be laid waste? </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_18"><sup>18</sup>But if they <i>are</i> prophets, and if the word of the Lord is with them, let them now make intercession to the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord, <i>in</i> the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, do not go to Babylon.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_27_19"> <sup>19</sup>“For thus says the Lord of hosts <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:15; 2 Kin. 25:13–17; Jer. 52:17, 20, 21">⚓</a>concerning the pillars, concerning the Sea, concerning the carts, and concerning the remainder of the vessels that remain in this city, </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_20"><sup>20</sup>which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take, when he carried away <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:14, 15; 2 Chr. 36:10, 18; Jer. 24:1">⚓</a>captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_21"><sup>21</sup>yes, thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 20:5">⚓</a>vessels that remain in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem: </span>
<span class="verse gie_27_22"><sup>22</sup>‘They shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:13; 2 Chr. 36:18">⚓</a>carried to Babylon, and there they shall be until the day that I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:21; Jer. 29:10; 32:5">⚓</a>visit them,’ says the Lord. ‘Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 1:7; 7:19">⚓</a>I will bring them up and restore them to this place.’ ”<br/></span>
