<span class="verse gie_29_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now these <i>are</i> the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the remainder of the elders who were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 27:20">⚓</a>carried away captive—to the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_2"><sup>2</sup>(This happened after <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:12–16; 2 Chr. 36:9, 10; Jer. 22:24–28">⚓</a>Jeconiah the king, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:12, 15; Jer. 13:18">⚓</a>queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem.) </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_3"><sup>3</sup><i>The</i> <i>letter</i> <i>was</i> <i>sent</i> by the hand of Elasah the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 34:8">⚓</a>Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying,<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_29_4">  <sup>4</sup>Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all who were carried away captive, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_29_5">   <sup>5</sup>Build houses and dwell <i>in</i> <i>them;</i> plant gardens and eat their fruit. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_6">   <sup>6</sup>Take wives and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters—that you may be increased there, and not diminished. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_7">   <sup>7</sup>And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 6:10; Neh. 1:4–11; Dan. 9:16; 1 Tim. 2:2">⚓</a>and pray to the Lord for it; for in its peace you will have peace. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_8">   <sup>8</sup>For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are in your midst <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 14:14; 23:21; 27:14, 15; Eph. 5:6">⚓</a>deceive you, nor listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_9">   <sup>9</sup>For they prophesy <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 28:15; 37:19">⚓</a>falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them, says the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_29_10">   <sup>10</sup>For thus says the Lord: After <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:21–23; Ezra 1:1–4; Jer. 25:12; 27:22; Dan. 9:2; Zech. 7:5">⚓</a>seventy years are completed at Babylon, I will visit you and perform My good word toward you, and cause you to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 24:6, 7); Zeph. 2:7">⚓</a>return to this place. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_11">   <sup>11</sup>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_12">   <sup>12</sup>Then you will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 50:15; Jer. 33:3; Dan. 9:3">⚓</a>call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 145:19">⚓</a>listen to you. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_13">   <sup>13</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:39–42; Deut. 30:1–3">⚓</a>you will seek Me and find <i>Me,</i> when you search for Me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 22:19; 2 Chr. 22:9; Jer. 24:7">⚓</a>with all your heart. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_14">   <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 4:7); Ps. 32:6; 46:1; (Is. 55:6, 7); Jer. 24:7">⚓</a>I will be found by you, says the Lord, and I will bring you back from your captivity; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 43:5, 6; Jer. 23:8; 32:37">⚓</a>I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you, says the Lord, and I will bring you to the place from which I cause you to be carried away captive.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_29_15">   <sup>15</sup>Because you have said, “The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon”— </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_16">   <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 38:2, 3, 17–23">⚓</a>therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, concerning all the people who dwell in this city, and concerning your brethren who have not gone out with you into captivity— </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_17">   <sup>17</sup>thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 24:3, 8–10">⚓</a>rotten figs that cannot be eaten, they are so bad. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_18">   <sup>18</sup>And I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence; and I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:25; 2 Chr. 29:8; Jer. 15:4; 24:9; 34:17; Ezek. 12:15">⚓</a>will deliver them to trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth—to be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 26:6; 42:18">⚓</a>a curse, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them, </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_19">   <sup>19</sup>because they have not heeded My words, says the Lord, which <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 25:4; 26:5; 35:15">⚓</a>I sent to them by My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending <i>them;</i> neither would you heed, says the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_20">   <sup>20</sup>Therefore hear the word of the Lord, all you of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_29_21">   <sup>21</sup>Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 14:14, 15; Lam. 2:14; 2 Pet. 2:1">⚓</a>lie to you in My name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall slay them before your eyes. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_22">   <sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:20; Is. 65:15">⚓</a>And because of them a curse shall be taken up by all the captivity of Judah who <i>are</i> in Babylon, saying, “The Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 3:6, 21">⚓</a>whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire”; </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_23">   <sup>23</sup>because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 23:14">⚓</a>they have done disgraceful things in Israel, have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken lying words in My name, which I have not commanded them. Indeed I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 5:21; Jer. 16:17); Mal. 3:5; (Heb. 4:13)">⚓</a>know, and <i>am</i> a witness, says the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_29_24">   <sup>24</sup>You shall also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_25">   <sup>25</sup>Thus speaks the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: You have sent letters in your name to all the people who <i>are</i> at Jerusalem, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:18; Jer. 21:1">⚓</a>to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_26">   <sup>26</sup>“The Lord has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, so that there should be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 20:1">⚓</a>officers <i>in</i> the house of the Lord over every man <i>who</i> is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:11; Hos. 9:7; Mark 3:21; John 10:20; Acts 26:24; (2 Cor. 5:13)">⚓</a>demented and considers himself a prophet, that you should <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 20:1, 2; Acts 16:24">⚓</a>put him in prison and in the stocks. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_27">   <sup>27</sup>Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who makes himself a prophet to you? </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_28">   <sup>28</sup>For he has sent to us <i>in</i> Babylon, saying, ‘This <i>captivity</i> <i>is</i> long; build houses and dwell <i>in</i> <i>them,</i> and plant gardens and eat their fruit.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_29_29"> <sup>29</sup>Now Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet. </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_30"><sup>30</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying: </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_31"><sup>31</sup>Send to all those in captivity, saying, Thus says the Lord concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 28:15">⚓</a>and I have not sent him, and he has caused you to trust in a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 13:8–16, 22, 23">⚓</a>lie— </span>
<span class="verse gie_29_32"><sup>32</sup>therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his family: he shall not have anyone to dwell among this people, nor shall he see the good that I will do for My people, says the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 28:16">⚓</a>because he has taught rebellion against the Lord.<br/></span>
