<span class="verse gie_32_1"> <sup>1</sup>The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:1, 2; Jer. 39:1, 2">⚓</a>in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_2"><sup>2</sup>For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 3:25; Jer. 33:1; 37:21; 39:14">⚓</a>in the court of the prison, which <i>was</i> <i>in</i> the king of Judah’s house. </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_3"><sup>3</sup>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, “Why do you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 26:8, 9">⚓</a>prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:3–7; 34:2">⚓</a>“Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_4"><sup>4</sup>and Zedekiah king of Judah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:4–7; Jer. 34:3; 38:18, 23; 39:5; 52:9">⚓</a>shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face, and see him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:5">⚓</a>eye to eye; </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_5"><sup>5</sup>then he shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 27:22; 39:7; Ezek. 12:12, 13">⚓</a>lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 27:22">⚓</a>until I visit him,” says the Lord; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:4; 33:5">⚓</a>“though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed” ’?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_32_6"> <sup>6</sup>And Jeremiah said, “The word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_7"><sup>7</sup>‘Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you, saying, “Buy my field which <i>is</i> in Anathoth, for the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 25:24, 25, 32; Ruth 4:4">⚓</a>right of redemption <i>is</i> yours to buy <i>it.</i>” ’ </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_8"><sup>8</sup>Then Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the Lord, and said to me, ‘Please buy my field that <i>is</i> in Anathoth, which <i>is</i> in the country of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance <i>is</i> yours, and the redemption yours; buy <i>it</i> for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_9"><sup>9</sup>So I bought the field from Hanamel, the son of my uncle who <i>was</i> in Anathoth, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 23:16; Zech. 11:12">⚓</a>weighed <i>out</i> <i>to</i> him the money—seventeen shekels of silver. </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_10"><sup>10</sup>And I signed the deed and sealed <i>it,</i> took witnesses, and weighed the money on the scales. </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_11"><sup>11</sup>So I took the purchase deed, <i>both</i> that which was sealed <i>according</i> to the law and custom, and that which was open; </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_12"><sup>12</sup>and I gave the purchase deed to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 36:4">⚓</a>Baruch the son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle’s <i>son,</i> and in the presence of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 8:2">⚓</a>witnesses who signed the purchase deed, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the prison.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_32_13"> <sup>13</sup>“Then I charged <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 36:4">⚓</a>Baruch before them, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_14"><sup>14</sup>‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Take these deeds, both this purchase deed which is sealed and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last many days.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_15"><sup>15</sup>For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Houses and fields and vineyards shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 2:1; (Jer. 31:5, 12, 14); Amos 9:14, 15; Zech. 3:10">⚓</a>possessed again in this land.” ’<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jeremiah Prays for Understanding</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_32_16"> <sup>16</sup>“Now when I had delivered the purchase deed to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the Lord, saying: </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_17"><sup>17</sup>‘Ah, Lord God! Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:15; Ps. 102:25; Is. 40:26–29; Jer. 27:5">⚓</a>You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:14; Jer. 32:27; Zech. 8:6; Matt. 19:26; Mark 10:27; Luke 18:27">⚓</a>There is nothing too hard for You. </span>

<span class="verse gie_32_19"><sup>19</sup><i>You</i> <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 28:29">⚓</a>great in counsel and mighty in work, for Your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 34:21; Ps. 33:13; Prov. 5:21; Jer. 16:17">⚓</a>eyes <i>are</i> open to all the ways of the sons of men, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 62:12; Jer. 17:10; (Matt. 16:27; John 5:29)">⚓</a>to give everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings. </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_20"><sup>20</sup>You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, to this day, and in Israel and among <i>other</i> men; and You have made Yourself <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:16; 1 Chr. 17:21; Is. 63:12; Jer. 13:11; Dan. 9:15">⚓</a>a name, as it is this day. </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_21"><sup>21</sup>You <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:6; 2 Sam. 7:23; 1 Chr. 17:21; Ps. 136:11, 12">⚓</a>have brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror; </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_22"><sup>22</sup>You have given them this land, of which You swore to their fathers to give them—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:8, 17; Deut. 1:8; Ps. 105:9–11; Jer. 11:5">⚓</a>“a land flowing with milk and honey.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_23"><sup>23</sup>And they came in and took possession of it, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Neh. 9:26); Jer. 11:8; (Dan. 9:10–14)">⚓</a>they have not obeyed Your voice or walked in Your law. They have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have caused all this calamity to come upon them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_32_24"> <sup>24</sup>‘Look, the siege mounds! They have come to the city to take it; and the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 14:12; Ezek. 14:21">⚓</a>the sword and famine and pestilence.

<span class="verse gie_32_25"><sup>25</sup>And You have said to me, O Lord God, “Buy the field for money, and take witnesses”!—yet the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ ”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>God’s Assurance of the People’s Return</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_32_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_32_27"><sup>27</sup>“Behold, I <i>am</i> the Lord, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Num. 16:22)">⚓</a>God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me? </span>
