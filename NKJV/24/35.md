<div class="title"><h1>35</h1><h3>The Obedient Rechabites</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_35_1"> <sup>1</sup>The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_35_2"><sup>2</sup>“Go to the house of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 4:2; 2 Kin. 10:15; 1 Chr. 2:55">⚓</a>Rechabites, speak to them, and bring them into the house of the Lord, into one of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:5, 8; 1 Chr. 9:26, 33">⚓</a>the chambers, and give them wine to drink.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_35_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, his brothers and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites, </span>
<span class="verse gie_35_4"><sup>4</sup>and I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which <i>was</i> by the chamber of the princes, above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:9; 25:18; 1 Chr. 9:18, 19">⚓</a>the keeper of the door. </span>
<span class="verse gie_35_5"><sup>5</sup>Then I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_35_6"> <sup>6</sup>But they said, “We will drink no wine, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 10:15, 23">⚓</a>Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall drink <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 10:9; Num. 6:2–4; Judg. 13:7, 14; Prov. 31:4; Ezek. 44:21; Luke 1:15">⚓</a>no wine, you nor your sons, forever. </span>
<span class="verse gie_35_7"><sup>7</sup>You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, nor have <i>any</i> <i>of</i> <i>these;</i> but all your days you shall dwell in tents, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:12; Eph. 6:2, 3">⚓</a>that you may live many days in the land where you are sojourners.’ </span>
<span class="verse gie_35_8"><sup>8</sup>Thus we have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 1:8, 9; 4:1, 2, 10; 6:20; Eph. 6:1; Col. 3:20)">⚓</a>obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters, </span>
<span class="verse gie_35_9"><sup>9</sup>nor to build ourselves houses to dwell in; nor do we have vineyard, field, or seed. </span>
<span class="verse gie_35_10"><sup>10</sup>But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. </span>
<span class="verse gie_35_11"><sup>11</sup>But it came to pass, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, ‘Come, let us <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 4:5–7; 8:14">⚓</a>go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army of the Syrians.’ So we dwell at Jerusalem.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_35_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_35_13"><sup>13</sup>“Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 28:9–12); Jer. 6:10; 17:23; 32:33">⚓</a>receive instruction to obey My words?” says the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse gie_35_14"><sup>14</sup>“The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; for to this day they drink none, and obey their father’s commandment. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:15">⚓</a>But although I have spoken to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:13; 25:3">⚓</a>rising early and speaking, you did not obey Me. </span>
<span class="verse gie_35_15"><sup>15</sup>I have also sent to you all My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 26:4, 5; 29:19">⚓</a>servants the prophets, rising up early and sending <i>them,</i> saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 1:16, 17); Jer. 18:11; 25:5, 6; (Ezek. 18:30–32); Acts 26:20">⚓</a>‘Turn now everyone from his evil way, amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them; then you will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:7; 25:5, 6">⚓</a>dwell in the land which I have given you and your fathers.’ But you have not inclined your ear, nor obeyed Me. </span>
<span class="verse gie_35_16"><sup>16</sup>Surely the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 12:9)">⚓</a>father, which he commanded them, but this people has not obeyed Me.” ’<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_35_17"> <sup>17</sup>“Therefore thus says the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the doom that I have pronounced against them; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 1:24; Is. 65:12; 66:4; Jer. 7:13">⚓</a>because I have spoken to them but they have not heard, and I have called to them but they have not answered.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_35_18"> <sup>18</sup>And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts and done according to all that he commanded you, </span>
<span class="verse gie_35_19"><sup>19</sup>therefore thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 20:12); Jer. 15:19; (Luke 21:36; Eph. 6:2, 3)">⚓</a>stand before Me forever.” ’ ”<br/></span>
