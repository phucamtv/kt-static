<div class="title"><h1>37</h1><h3>Zedekiah’s Vain Hope</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_37_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now King <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:17; 1 Chr. 3:15; 2 Chr. 36:10; Jer. 22:24">⚓</a>Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse gie_37_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:19, 20; 2 Chr. 36:12–16; (Prov. 29:12)">⚓</a>But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land gave heed to the words of the Lord which He spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_37_3"> <sup>3</sup>And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:1, 2; 29:25; 52:24">⚓</a>Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 13:6; Jer. 42:2; Acts 8:24">⚓</a>“Pray now to the Lord our God for us.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_37_4"><sup>4</sup>Now Jeremiah was coming and going among the people, for they had not <i>yet</i> put him in prison. </span>
<span class="verse gie_37_5"><sup>5</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:7; Jer. 37:7; Ezek. 17:15">⚓</a>Pharaoh’s army came up from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they departed from Jerusalem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_37_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_37_7"><sup>7</sup>“Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, ‘Thus you shall say to the king of Judah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 36:6; Jer. 21:2; Ezek. 17:17">⚓</a>who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army which has come up to help you will return to Egypt, to their own land. </span>
<span class="verse gie_37_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:19; Jer. 34:22">⚓</a>And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city, and take it and burn it with fire.” ’ </span>
<span class="verse gie_37_9"><sup>9</sup>Thus says the Lord: ‘Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely depart from us,” for they will not depart. </span>
<span class="verse gie_37_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:36–38; Is. 30:17; Jer. 21:4, 5">⚓</a>For though you had defeated the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained <i>only</i> wounded men among them, they would rise up, every man in his tent, and burn the city with fire.’ ”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jeremiah Imprisoned</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_37_11"> <sup>11</sup>And it happened, when the army of the Chaldeans left <i>the</i> <i>siege</i> of Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army, </span>
<span class="verse gie_37_12"><sup>12</sup>that Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to claim his property there among the people. </span>
<span class="verse gie_37_13"><sup>13</sup>And when he was in the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard <i>was</i> there whose name <i>was</i> Irijah the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_37_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then Jeremiah said, “False! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.” But he did not listen to him.<br/> So Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him to the princes. </span>
<span class="verse gie_37_15"><sup>15</sup>Therefore the princes were angry with Jeremiah, and they struck him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 20:2; (Matt. 21:35)">⚓</a>and put him in prison in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:20; 2 Chr. 16:10; 18:26; Jer. 38:26; Acts 5:18">⚓</a>house of Jonathan the scribe. For they had made that the prison.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_37_16"> <sup>16</sup>When Jeremiah entered <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 38:6">⚓</a>the dungeon and the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days, </span>
<span class="verse gie_37_17"><sup>17</sup>then Zedekiah the king sent and took him <i>out.</i> The king asked him secretly in his house, and said, “Is there <i>any</i> word from the Lord?”<br/> And Jeremiah said, “There is.” Then he said, “You shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:4–7; Jer. 21:7; Ezek. 12:12, 13; 17:19–21">⚓</a>delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_37_18"> <sup>18</sup>Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What offense have I committed against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison? </span>
<span class="verse gie_37_19"><sup>19</sup>Where now <i>are</i> your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land’? </span>
<span class="verse gie_37_20"><sup>20</sup>Therefore please hear now, O my lord the king. Please, let my petition be accepted before you, and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_37_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 32:2; 38:13, 28">⚓</a>to the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread from the bakers’ street, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:3; Jer. 38:9; 52:6">⚓</a>until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.<br/></span>
