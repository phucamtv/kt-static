<div class="title"><h1>38</h1><h3>Jeremiah in the Dungeon</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_38_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 37:3">⚓</a>Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:1">⚓</a>Pashhur the son of Malchiah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:8">⚓</a>heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_2"><sup>2</sup>“Thus says the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:9">⚓</a>‘He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he who goes over to the Chaldeans shall live; his life shall be as a prize to him, and he shall live.’ </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_3"><sup>3</sup>Thus says the Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:10; 32:3">⚓</a>‘This city shall surely be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 34:2">⚓</a>given into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which shall take it.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_38_4"> <sup>4</sup>Therefore the princes said to the king, “Please, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 26:11">⚓</a>let this man be put to death, for thus he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man does not seek the welfare of this people, but their harm.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_38_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Zedekiah the king said, “Look, he <i>is</i> in your hand. For the king can <i>do</i> nothing against you.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 37:21; Lam. 3:55">⚓</a>So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the king’s son, which <i>was</i> in the court of the prison, and they let Jeremiah down with ropes. And in the dungeon <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no water, but mire. So Jeremiah sank in the mire.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_38_7"> <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:16">⚓</a>Now Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon. When the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin, </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_8"><sup>8</sup>Ebed-Melech went out of the king’s house and spoke to the king, saying: </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_9"><sup>9</sup>“My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon, and he is likely to die from hunger in the place where he is. For <i>there</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 37:21">⚓</a>no more bread in the city.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_10"><sup>10</sup>Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here thirty men with you, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he dies.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_11"><sup>11</sup>So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there old clothes and old rags, and let them down by ropes into the dungeon to Jeremiah. </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_12"><sup>12</sup>Then Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Please put these old clothes and rags under your armpits, under the ropes.” And Jeremiah did so. </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_13"><sup>13</sup>So they pulled Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the dungeon. And Jeremiah remained <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 3:25; Jer. 37:21; Acts 23:35; 24:27; 28:16, 30">⚓</a>in the court of the prison.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Zedekiah’s Fears and Jeremiah’s Advice</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_38_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then Zedekiah the king sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance of the house of the Lord. And the king said to Jeremiah, “I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:1, 2; 37:17">⚓</a>ask you something. Hide nothing from me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_38_15"> <sup>15</sup>Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare <i>it</i> to you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_38_16"> <sup>16</sup>So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “<i>As</i> the Lord lives, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:22; Is. 57:16; Zech. 12:1; (Acts 17:25, 28)">⚓</a>who made our very souls, I will not put you to death, nor will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_38_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘If you surely <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:12">⚓</a>surrender <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:3">⚓</a>to the king of Babylon’s princes, then your soul shall live; this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live. </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_18"><sup>18</sup>But if you do not surrender to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans; they shall burn it with fire, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 32:4; 34:3">⚓</a>you shall not escape from their hand.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_38_19"> <sup>19</sup>And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:9">⚓</a>defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 31:4">⚓</a>abuse me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_38_20"> <sup>20</sup>But Jeremiah said, “They shall not deliver <i>you.</i> Please, obey the voice of the Lord which I speak to you. So it shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:9">⚓</a>well with you, and your soul shall live. </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_21"><sup>21</sup>But if you refuse to surrender, this <i>is</i> the word that the Lord has shown me: </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_22"><sup>22</sup>‘Now behold, all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 8:10">⚓</a>women who are left in the king of Judah’s house <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> surrendered to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those <i>women</i> shall say:<br/>  “Your close friends have set upon you<br/>   And prevailed against you;<br/>   Your feet have sunk in the mire,<br/>   <i>And</i> they have turned away again.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_38_23"> <sup>23</sup>‘So they shall surrender all your wives and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:6; 41:10">⚓</a>children to the Chaldeans. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:5">⚓</a>You shall not escape from their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. And you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_38_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die. </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_25"><sup>25</sup>But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say to you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king, and also what the king said to you; do not hide <i>it</i> from us, and we will not put you to death,’ </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_26"><sup>26</sup>then you shall say to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 37:20">⚓</a>‘I presented my request before the king, that he would not make me return <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 37:15">⚓</a>to Jonathan’s house to die there.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_38_27"> <sup>27</sup>Then all the princes came to Jeremiah and asked him. And he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been heard. </span>
<span class="verse gie_38_28"><sup>28</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 23:4); Jer. 37:21; 39:14">⚓</a>Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken. And he was <i>there</i> when Jerusalem was taken.<br/></span>
