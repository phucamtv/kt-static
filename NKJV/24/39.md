<span class="verse gie_39_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:1–12; Jer. 52:4; Ezek. 24:1, 2">⚓</a>ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it. </span>
<span class="verse gie_39_2"><sup>2</sup>In the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:3">⚓</a>eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth <i>day</i> of the month, the city was penetrated.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_39_3"> <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:15; 38:17">⚓</a>Then all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer, Samgar-Nebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sarezer, Rabmag, with the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_39_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:4; Is. 30:16; Jer. 52:7; Amos 2:14">⚓</a>So it was, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, that they fled and went out of the city by night, by way of the king’s garden, by the gate between the two walls. And he went out by way of the plain. </span>
<span class="verse gie_39_5"><sup>5</sup>But the Chaldean army pursued them and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:7; 32:4; 38:18, 23">⚓</a>overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And when they had captured him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:33; Jer. 52:9, 26, 27">⚓</a>Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment on him. </span>
<span class="verse gie_39_6"><sup>6</sup>Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:34">⚓</a>eyes in Riblah; the king of Babylon also killed all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 34:19–21">⚓</a>nobles of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse gie_39_7"><sup>7</sup>Moreover <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:7; Jer. 52:11; Ezek. 12:13">⚓</a>he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with bronze fetters to carry him off to Babylon. </span>
<span class="verse gie_39_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:9; Jer. 38:18; 52:13">⚓</a>And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the houses of the people with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:10">⚓</a>fire, and broke down the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:10; Neh. 1:3; Jer. 52:14">⚓</a>walls of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse gie_39_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:8, 11, 12, 20">⚓</a>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive to Babylon the remnant of the people who remained in the city and those who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 38:19">⚓</a>defected to him, with the rest of the people who remained. </span>
<span class="verse gie_39_10"><sup>10</sup>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left in the land of Judah the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:7">⚓</a>poor people, who had nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jeremiah Goes Free</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_39_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_39_12"><sup>12</sup>“Take him and look after him, and do him no <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:18, 19; 15:20, 21">⚓</a>harm; but do to him just as he says to you.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_39_13"><sup>13</sup>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent Nebushasban, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s chief officers; </span>
<span class="verse gie_39_14"><sup>14</sup>then they sent <i>someone</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 38:28">⚓</a>to take Jeremiah from the court of the prison, and committed him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:5">⚓</a>to Gedaliah the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 22:12, 14; 2 Chr. 34:20; Jer. 26:24">⚓</a>Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should take him home. So he dwelt among the people.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_39_15"> <sup>15</sup>Meanwhile the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_39_16"><sup>16</sup>“Go and speak to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 38:7, 12">⚓</a>Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:10; (Dan. 9:12; Zech. 1:6)">⚓</a>I will bring My words upon this city for adversity and not for good, and they shall be <i>performed</i> in that day before you. </span>
<span class="verse gie_39_17"><sup>17</sup>But I will deliver you in that day,” says the Lord, “and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you <i>are</i> afraid. </span>
<span class="verse gie_39_18"><sup>18</sup>For I will surely deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 21:9; 45:5">⚓</a>your life shall be as a prize to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 5:20; Ps. 37:40; (Jer. 17:7, 8)">⚓</a>because you have put your trust in Me,” says the Lord.’ ”<br/></span>
