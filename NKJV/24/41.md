<div class="title"><h1>41</h1><h3>Insurrection Against Gedaliah</h3></div>
<span class="verse gie_41_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass in the seventh month <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:25">⚓</a><i>that</i> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family and of the officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:6, 10">⚓</a>Mizpah. And there they ate bread together in Mizpah. </span>
<span class="verse gie_41_2"><sup>2</sup>Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, arose and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 3:27; 20:9, 10; 2 Kin. 25:25; Ps. 41:9; 109:5; John 13:18">⚓</a>struck Gedaliah the son of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 26:24">⚓</a>Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him whom the king of Babylon had made <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:5">⚓</a>governor over the land. </span>
<span class="verse gie_41_3"><sup>3</sup>Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with him, <i>that</i> <i>is,</i> with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_41_4"> <sup>4</sup>And it happened, on the second day after he had killed Gedaliah, when as yet no one knew <i>it,</i></span>
<span class="verse gie_41_5"><sup>5</sup>that certain men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:27, 28; Deut. 14:1; Is. 15:2">⚓</a>with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring <i>them</i> to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:7; 2 Kin. 25:9; Neh. 10:34, 35">⚓</a>the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse gie_41_6"><sup>6</sup>Now Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went along; and it happened as he met them that he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!” </span>
<span class="verse gie_41_7"><sup>7</sup>So it was, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 55:23; Is. 59:7; Ezek. 22:27; 33:24, 26">⚓</a>killed them <i>and</i> <i>cast</i> <i>them</i> into the midst of a pit, he and the men who were with him. </span>
<span class="verse gie_41_8"><sup>8</sup>But ten men were found among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us, for we have treasures of wheat, barley, oil, and honey in the field.” So he desisted and did not kill them among their brethren. </span>
<span class="verse gie_41_9"><sup>9</sup>Now the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, because of Gedaliah, <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 15:22; 2 Chr. 16:6">⚓</a>the same one Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with <i>the</i> slain. </span>
<span class="verse gie_41_10"><sup>10</sup>Then Ishmael carried away captive all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:11, 12">⚓</a>rest of the people who <i>were</i> in Mizpah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 43:6">⚓</a>the king’s daughters and all the people who remained in Mizpah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:7">⚓</a>whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:14">⚓</a>the Ammonites.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_41_11"> <sup>11</sup>But when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:7, 8, 13–16">⚓</a>Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that <i>were</i> with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, </span>
<span class="verse gie_41_12"><sup>12</sup>they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah; and they found him by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 2:13">⚓</a>the great pool that <i>is</i> in Gibeon. </span>
<span class="verse gie_41_13"><sup>13</sup>So it was, when all the people who <i>were</i> with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who <i>were</i> with him, that they were glad. </span>
<span class="verse gie_41_14"><sup>14</sup>Then all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. </span>
<span class="verse gie_41_15"><sup>15</sup>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_41_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, took from Mizpah all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:11, 12; 43:4–7">⚓</a>rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah after he had murdered Gedaliah the son of Ahikam—the mighty men of war and the women and the children and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon. </span>
<span class="verse gie_41_17"><sup>17</sup>And they departed and dwelt in the habitation of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 19:37, 38">⚓</a>Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, as they went on their way to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 43:7">⚓</a>Egypt, </span>
<span class="verse gie_41_18"><sup>18</sup>because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had murdered Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:5">⚓</a>whom the king of Babylon had made governor in the land.<br/></span>
