<span class="verse gie_42_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now all the captains of the forces, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:8, 13; 41:11">⚓</a>Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people, from the least to the greatest, came near </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_2"><sup>2</sup>and said to Jeremiah the prophet, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 15:11">⚓</a>“Please, let our petition be acceptable to you, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 8:28; 1 Sam. 7:8; 12:19; 1 Kin. 13:6; Is. 37:4; Jer. 37:3; Acts 8:24; (James 5:16)">⚓</a>pray for us to the Lord your God, for all this remnant (since we are left <i>but</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:22; Deut. 28:62; Is. 1:9; Lam. 1:1">⚓</a>a few of many, as you can see), </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_3"><sup>3</sup>that the Lord your God may show us <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 8:21">⚓</a>the way in which we should walk and the thing we should do.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_42_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard. Indeed, I will pray to the Lord your God according to your words, and it shall be, <i>that</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:14; Jer. 23:28">⚓</a>whatever the Lord answers you, I will declare <i>it</i> to you. I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:17, 18; Ps. 40:10; Acts 20:20">⚓</a>keep nothing back from you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_42_5"> <sup>5</sup>So they said to Jeremiah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 31:50; Judg. 11:10; Jer. 43:2; Mic. 1:2; Mal. 2:14; 3:5">⚓</a>“Let the Lord be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not do according to everything which the Lord your God sends us by you. </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_6"><sup>6</sup>Whether <i>it</i> <i>is</i> pleasing or displeasing, we will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:7; Deut. 5:27; Josh. 24:24">⚓</a>obey the voice of the Lord our God to whom we send you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 5:29, 33; 6:3; Jer. 7:23">⚓</a>that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the Lord our God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_42_7"> <sup>7</sup>And it happened after ten days that the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah. </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_8"><sup>8</sup>Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces which <i>were</i> with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_9"><sup>9</sup>and said to them, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition before Him: </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_10"><sup>10</sup>‘If you will still remain in this land, then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 24:6; 31:28; 33:7; Ezek. 36:36">⚓</a>I will build you and not pull <i>you</i> down, and I will plant you and not pluck <i>you</i> up. For I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:36; (Jer. 18:8)">⚓</a>relent concerning the disaster that I have brought upon you. </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_11"><sup>11</sup>Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; do not be afraid of him,’ says the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:9; 2 Chr. 32:7, 8; Is. 8:9, 10; 43:2, 5; Jer. 1:19; 15:20; Rom. 8:31">⚓</a>‘for I <i>am</i> with you, to save you and deliver you from his hand. </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_12"><sup>12</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 1:11; Ps. 106:46; Prov. 16:7">⚓</a>I will show you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and cause you to return to your own land.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_42_13"> <sup>13</sup>“But if <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 44:16">⚓</a>you say, ‘We will not dwell in this land,’ disobeying the voice of the Lord your God, </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_14"><sup>14</sup>saying, ‘No, but we will go to the land of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 31:1; Jer. 41:17; 43:7">⚓</a>Egypt where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor be hungry for bread, and there we will dwell’— </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_15"><sup>15</sup>Then hear now the word of the Lord, O remnant of Judah! Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘If you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:16; Jer. 44:12–14">⚓</a>wholly set <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 9:51">⚓</a>your faces to enter Egypt, and go to dwell there, </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_16"><sup>16</sup>then it shall be <i>that</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 44:13, 27; Ezek. 11:8; Amos 9:1–4">⚓</a>sword which you feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; the famine of which you were afraid shall follow close after you there <i>in</i> Egypt; and there you shall die. </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_17"><sup>17</sup>So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to dwell there. They shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 44:14, 28">⚓</a>none of them shall remain or escape from the disaster that I will bring upon them.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_42_18"> <sup>18</sup>“For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘As My anger and My fury have been <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:16–19; Jer. 7:20">⚓</a>poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will My fury be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:21; Is. 65:15; Jer. 18:16; 24:9; 26:6; 29:18, 22; 44:12">⚓</a>you shall be an oath, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_42_19"> <sup>19</sup>“The Lord has said concerning you, O remnant of Judah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:16; Is. 30:1–7">⚓</a>‘Do not go to Egypt!’ Know certainly that I have admonished you this day. </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_20"><sup>20</sup>For you were hypocrites in your hearts when you sent me to the Lord your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to the Lord our God, and according to all that the Lord your God says, so declare to us and we will do <i>it.</i>’ </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_21"><sup>21</sup>And I have this day declared <i>it</i> to you, but you have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 30:1–7">⚓</a>not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God, or anything which He has sent you by me. </span>
<span class="verse gie_42_22"><sup>22</sup>Now therefore, know certainly that you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 42:17; Ezek. 6:11">⚓</a>shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to dwell.”<br/></span>
