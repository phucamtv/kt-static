<span class="verse gie_43_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it happened, when Jeremiah had stopped speaking to all the people all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 42:9–18">⚓</a>words of the Lord their God, for which the Lord their God had sent him to them, all these words, </span>
<span class="verse gie_43_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 42:1">⚓</a>that Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men spoke, saying to Jeremiah, “You speak falsely! The Lord our God has not sent you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt to dwell there.’ </span>
<span class="verse gie_43_3"><sup>3</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 36:4; 45:1">⚓</a>Baruch the son of Neriah has set you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death or carry us away captive to Babylon.” </span>
<span class="verse gie_43_4"><sup>4</sup>So Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces, and all the people would <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:26">⚓</a>not obey the voice of the Lord, to remain in the land of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse gie_43_5"><sup>5</sup>But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 40:11, 12">⚓</a>all the remnant of Judah who had returned to dwell in the land of Judah, from all nations where they had been driven— </span>
<span class="verse gie_43_6"><sup>6</sup>men, women, children, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 41:10">⚓</a>the king’s daughters, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:10; 40:7">⚓</a>and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah. </span>
<span class="verse gie_43_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 42:19">⚓</a>So they went to the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the Lord. And they went as far as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 2:16; 44:1">⚓</a>Tahpanhes.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_43_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 44:1–30">⚓</a>word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gie_43_9"><sup>9</sup>“Take large stones in your hand, and hide them in the sight of the men of Judah, in the clay in the brick courtyard which <i>is</i> at the entrance to Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes; </span>
<span class="verse gie_43_10"><sup>10</sup>and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, I will send and bring Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 25:9; 27:6; Ezek. 29:18, 20">⚓</a>My servant, and will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden. And he will spread his royal pavilion over them. </span>
<span class="verse gie_43_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 19:1–25; Jer. 25:15–19; 44:13; 46:1, 2, 13–26; Ezek. 29:19, 20">⚓</a>When he comes, he shall strike the land of Egypt <i>and</i> <i>deliver</i> to death <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 15:2; Zech. 11:9">⚓</a><i>those</i> <i>appointed</i> for death, and to captivity <i>those</i> <i>appointed</i> for captivity, and to the sword <i>those</i> <i>appointed</i> for the sword. </span>
<span class="verse gie_43_12"><sup>12</sup>I will kindle a fire in the houses of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:12; Is. 19:1; Jer. 46:25; Ezek. 30:13">⚓</a>the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them and carry them away captive. And he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment, and he shall go out from there in peace. </span>
<span class="verse gie_43_13"><sup>13</sup>He shall also break the <i>sacred</i> pillars of Beth Shemesh that <i>are</i> in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians he shall burn with fire.” ’ ”<br/></span>
