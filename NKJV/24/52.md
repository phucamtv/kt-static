<span class="verse gie_52_2"><sup>2</sup>He also did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. </span>
<span class="verse gie_52_3"><sup>3</sup>For because of the anger of the Lord<i>this</i> happened in Jerusalem and Judah, till He finally cast them out from His presence. Then Zedekiah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:13">⚓</a>rebelled against the king of Babylon.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_52_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now it came to pass in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:1; Jer. 39:1; Ezek. 24:1, 2; Zech. 8:19">⚓</a>ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and encamped against it; and <i>they</i> built a siege wall against it all around. </span>
<span class="verse gie_52_5"><sup>5</sup>So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. </span>
<span class="verse gie_52_6"><sup>6</sup>By the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. </span>
<span class="verse gie_52_7"><sup>7</sup>Then the city <i>wall</i> was broken through, and all the men of war fled and went out of the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls, which <i>was</i> by the king’s garden, even though the Chaldeans <i>were</i> near the city all around. And they went by way of the plain.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gie_52_8"> <sup>8</sup>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him. </span>
<span class="verse gie_52_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:6; Jer. 32:4; 39:5">⚓</a>So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he pronounced judgment on him. </span>
<span class="verse gie_52_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 12:13">⚓</a>Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. And he killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah. </span>
<span class="verse gie_52_11"><sup>11</sup>He also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 12:13">⚓</a>put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in bronze fetters, took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.<br/></span>
