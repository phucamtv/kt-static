<span class="verse exe_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth <i>month,</i> on the fifth <i>day</i> of the month, as I <i>was</i> among the captives by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:15, 23; 10:15">⚓</a>the River Chebar, <i>that</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:21; Acts 7:56; 10:11; Rev. 4:1; 19:11">⚓</a>the heavens were opened and I saw <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:10; Num. 12:6; Is. 1:1; 6:1; Ezek. 8:3; Dan. 8:1, 2">⚓</a>visions of God. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_2"><sup>2</sup>On the fifth <i>day</i> of the month, which <i>was</i> in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity, </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_3"><sup>3</sup>the word of the Lord came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the River Chebar; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:46; 2 Kin. 3:15; Ezek. 3:14, 22">⚓</a>the hand of the Lord was upon him there.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_1_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then I looked, and behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 21:1; Jer. 23:19; 25:32; Ezek. 13:11, 13">⚓</a>a whirlwind was coming <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:14">⚓</a>out of the north, a great cloud with raging fire engulfing itself; and brightness <i>was</i> all around it and radiating out of its midst like the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:15, 17, 20; Rev. 4:6–8">⚓</a>Also from within it <i>came</i> the likeness of four living creatures. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:8">⚓</a>this <i>was</i> their appearance: they had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:14">⚓</a>the likeness of a man. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_6"><sup>6</sup>Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_7"><sup>7</sup>Their legs <i>were</i> straight, and the soles of their feet <i>were</i> like the soles of calves’ feet. They sparkled <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:6; Rev. 1:15">⚓</a>like the color of burnished bronze. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:8, 21">⚓</a>The hands of a man <i>were</i> under their wings on their four sides; and each of the four had faces and wings. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_9"><sup>9</sup>Their wings touched one another. <i>The</i> <i>creatures</i> did not turn when they went, but each one went straight <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:12; 10:20–22">⚓</a>forward.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_1_10"> <sup>10</sup>As for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:14; Rev. 4:7">⚓</a>the likeness of their faces, <i>each</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 2:10">⚓</a>had the face of a man; each of the four had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 2:3">⚓</a>the face of a lion on the right side, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 2:18">⚓</a>each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 2:25">⚓</a>and each of the four had the face of an eagle. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_11"><sup>11</sup>Thus <i>were</i> their faces. Their wings stretched upward; two <i>wings</i> of each one touched one another, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 6:2; Ezek. 1:23">⚓</a>two covered their bodies. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_12"><sup>12</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:11, 22">⚓</a>each one went straight forward; they went wherever the spirit wanted to go, and they did not turn when they went.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_1_13"> <sup>13</sup>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance <i>was</i> like burning coals of fire, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 104:4; Rev. 4:5">⚓</a>like the appearance of torches going back and forth among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and out of the fire went lightning. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_14"><sup>14</sup>And the living creatures ran back and forth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 4:10; (Matt. 24:27; Luke 17:24)">⚓</a>in appearance like a flash of lightning.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_1_15"> <sup>15</sup>Now as I looked at the living creatures, behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:9">⚓</a>a wheel <i>was</i> on the earth beside each living creature with its four faces. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:9, 10">⚓</a>The appearance of the wheels and their workings <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:6">⚓</a>like the color of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. The appearance of their workings <i>was,</i> as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_17"><sup>17</sup>When they moved, they went toward any one of four directions; they did not turn aside when they went. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_18"><sup>18</sup>As for their rims, they were so high they were awesome; and their rims <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:12; (Zech. 4:10); Rev. 4:6, 8">⚓</a>full of eyes, all around the four of them. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:16, 17">⚓</a>When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_20"><sup>20</sup>Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, <i>because</i> there the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted together with them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:17">⚓</a>for the spirit of the living creatures <i>was</i> in the wheels. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_21"><sup>21</sup>When those went, <i>these</i> went; when those stood, <i>these</i> stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together with them, for the spirit of the living creatures <i>was</i> in the wheels.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_1_22"> <sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:1">⚓</a>The likeness of the firmament above the heads of the living creatures <i>was</i> like the color of an awesome <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 4:6">⚓</a>crystal, stretched out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:1">⚓</a>over their heads. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_23"><sup>23</sup>And under the firmament their wings <i>spread</i> <i>out</i> straight, one toward another. Each one had two which covered one side, and each one had two which covered the other side of the body. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:13; 10:5">⚓</a>When they went, I heard the noise of their wings, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 43:2; Dan. 10:6; Rev. 1:15">⚓</a>like the noise of many waters, like <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 37:4, 5; Ps. 29:3, 4; 68:33">⚓</a>the voice of the Almighty, a tumult like the noise of an army; and when they stood still, they let down their wings. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_25"><sup>25</sup>A voice came from above the firmament that <i>was</i> over their heads; whenever they stood, they let down their wings.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_1_26"> <sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:1">⚓</a>And above the firmament over their heads <i>was</i> the likeness of a throne, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:10, 16; Ezek. 8:4; 11:22, 23; 43:4, 5">⚓</a>in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne <i>was</i> a likeness with the appearance of a man high above <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 8:2">⚓</a>it. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_27"><sup>27</sup>Also from the appearance of His waist and upward <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 8:2">⚓</a>I saw, as it were, the color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it; and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire with brightness all around. </span>
<span class="verse exe_1_28"><sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 9:13); Rev. 4:3; 10:1">⚓</a>Like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so <i>was</i> the appearance of the brightness all around it. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:23; 8:4">⚓</a>This <i>was</i> the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ezekiel Sent to Rebellious Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_1_28"> So when I saw <i>it,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:3; Ezek. 3:23; Dan. 8:17; Acts 9:4; Rev. 1:17">⚓</a>I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking.<br/></span>
