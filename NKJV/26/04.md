<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>The Siege of Jerusalem Portrayed</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>“You also, son of man, take a clay tablet and lay it before you, and portray on it a city, Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse exe_4_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 6:6; Ezek. 21:22">⚓</a>Lay siege against it, build a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:1">⚓</a>siege wall against it, and heap up a mound against it; set camps against it also, and place battering rams against it all around. </span>
<span class="verse exe_4_3"><sup>3</sup>Moreover take for yourself an iron plate, and set it <i>as</i> an iron wall between you and the city. Set your face against it, and it shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:1, 2; Ezek. 5:2">⚓</a>besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 12:6, 11; 24:24, 27">⚓</a>This <i>will</i> <i>be</i> a sign to the house of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_4_4"> <sup>4</sup>“Lie also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. <i>According</i> to the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity. </span>
<span class="verse exe_4_5"><sup>5</sup>For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:34">⚓</a>so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse exe_4_6"><sup>6</sup>And when you have completed them, lie again on your right side; then you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have laid on you a day for each year.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_4_7"> <sup>7</sup>“Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem; your arm <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it. </span>
<span class="verse exe_4_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:25">⚓</a>And surely I will restrain you so that you cannot turn from one side to another till you have ended the days of your siege.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_4_9"> <sup>9</sup>“Also take for yourself wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them into one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself. <i>During</i> the number of days that you lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat it. </span>
<span class="verse exe_4_10"><sup>10</sup>And your food which you eat <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time you shall eat it. </span>
<span class="verse exe_4_11"><sup>11</sup>You shall also drink water by measure, one-sixth of a hin; from time to time you shall drink. </span>
<span class="verse exe_4_12"><sup>12</sup>And you shall eat it <i>as</i> barley cakes; and bake it using fuel of human waste in their sight.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then the Lord said, “So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 1:8; Hos. 9:3">⚓</a>shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_4_14"> <sup>14</sup>So I said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:14">⚓</a>“Ah, Lord God! Indeed I have never defiled myself from my youth till now; I have never eaten <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:31; Lev. 17:15; 22:8; Ezek. 44:31">⚓</a>what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 14:3; Is. 65:4; 66:17">⚓</a>abominable flesh ever come into my mouth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_4_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then He said to me, “See, I am giving you cow dung instead of human waste, and you shall prepare your bread over it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_4_16"> <sup>16</sup>Moreover He said to me, “Son of man, surely I will cut off the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:26; Ps. 105:16; Is. 3:1; Ezek. 5:16; 14:13">⚓</a>supply of bread in Jerusalem; they shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 4:10, 11; 12:19">⚓</a>eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 4:11">⚓</a>drink water by measure and with dread, </span>
<span class="verse exe_4_17"><sup>17</sup>that they may lack bread and water, and be dismayed with one another, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:39; Ezek. 24:23">⚓</a>waste away because of their iniquity.<br/></span>
