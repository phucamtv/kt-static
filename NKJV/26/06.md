<span class="verse exe_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </span>
<span class="verse exe_6_2"><sup>2</sup>“Son of man, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 20:46; 21:2; 25:2">⚓</a>set your face toward the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 36:1">⚓</a>mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, </span>
<span class="verse exe_6_3"><sup>3</sup>and say, ‘O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God! Thus says the Lord God to the mountains, to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys: “Indeed I, <i>even</i> I, will bring a sword against you, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:30">⚓</a>I will destroy your high places. </span>
<span class="verse exe_6_4"><sup>4</sup>Then your altars shall be desolate, your incense altars shall be broken, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:30">⚓</a>I will cast down your slain <i>men</i> before your idols. </span>
<span class="verse exe_6_5"><sup>5</sup>And I will lay the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars. </span>
<span class="verse exe_6_6"><sup>6</sup>In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, your idols may be broken and made to cease, your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. </span>
<span class="verse exe_6_7"><sup>7</sup>The slain shall fall in your midst, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 7:4, 9">⚓</a>you shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord.<br/></span>

<span class="verse exe_6_9"><sup>9</sup>Then those of you who escape will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 4:29); Ps. 137; Jer. 51:50">⚓</a>remember Me among the nations where they are carried captive, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:40; Is. 7:13; 43:24; Hos. 11:8">⚓</a>I was crushed by their adulterous heart which has departed from Me, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 15:39; Ezek. 20:7, 24">⚓</a>by their eyes which play the harlot after their idols; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:39; Job 42:6; Ezek. 20:43; 36:31">⚓</a>they will loathe themselves for the evils which they committed in all their abominations. </span>
<span class="verse exe_6_10"><sup>10</sup>And they shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord; I have not said in vain that I would bring this calamity upon them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_6_11"> <sup>11</sup>‘Thus says the Lord God: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 21:14">⚓</a>“Pound your fists and stamp your feet, and say, ‘Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 5:12">⚓</a>For they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. </span>
