<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>Abominations in the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth <i>month,</i> on the fifth <i>day</i> of the month, as I sat in my house with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 14:1; 20:1; 33:31">⚓</a>the elders of Judah sitting before me, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:3; 3:22">⚓</a>the hand of the Lord God fell upon me there. </span>
<span class="verse exe_8_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:26, 27">⚓</a>Then I looked, and there was a likeness, like the appearance of fire—from the appearance of His waist and downward, fire; and from His waist and upward, like the appearance of brightness, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:4, 27">⚓</a>like the color of amber. </span>
<span class="verse exe_8_3"><sup>3</sup>He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 5:5">⚓</a>stretched out the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my hair; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:14; Acts 8:39">⚓</a>the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 11:1, 24; 40:2">⚓</a>brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the north gate of the inner <i>court,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:30; 32:34; Ezek. 5:11">⚓</a>where the seat of the image of jealousy <i>was,</i> which <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:4; Deut. 32:16, 21">⚓</a>provokes to jealousy. </span>
<span class="verse exe_8_4"><sup>4</sup>And behold, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:12; 9:3">⚓</a>glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> there, like the vision that I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:28; 3:22, 23">⚓</a>saw in the plain.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_8_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then He said to me, “Son of man, lift your eyes now toward the north.” So I lifted my eyes toward the north, and there, north of the altar gate, was this image of jealousy in the entrance.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_8_6"> <sup>6</sup>Furthermore He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:4, 5; Ezek. 5:11; 8:9, 17">⚓</a>abominations that the house of Israel commits here, to make Me go far away from My sanctuary? Now turn again, you will see greater abominations.” </span>
<span class="verse exe_8_7"><sup>7</sup>So He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, there was a hole in the wall. </span>
<span class="verse exe_8_8"><sup>8</sup>Then He said to me, “Son of man, dig into the wall”; and when I dug into the wall, there was a door.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_8_9"> <sup>9</sup>And He said to me, “Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they are doing there.” </span>
<span class="verse exe_8_10"><sup>10</sup>So I went in and saw, and there—every <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:4; Deut. 4:16–18">⚓</a>sort of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:23">⚓</a>creeping thing, abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed all around on the walls. </span>
<span class="verse exe_8_11"><sup>11</sup>And there stood before them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:16, 25; Luke 10:1">⚓</a>seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan. Each man had a censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense went up. </span>
<span class="verse exe_8_12"><sup>12</sup>Then He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the room of his idols? For they say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 14:1; Is. 29:15; Ezek. 9:9">⚓</a>‘The Lord does not see us, the Lord has forsaken the land.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_8_13"> <sup>13</sup>And He said to me, “Turn again, <i>and</i> you will see greater abominations that they are doing.” </span>
<span class="verse exe_8_14"><sup>14</sup>So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the Lord’s house; and to my dismay, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_8_15"> <sup>15</sup>Then He said to me, “Have you seen <i>this,</i> O son of man? Turn again, you will see greater abominations than these.” </span>
<span class="verse exe_8_16"><sup>16</sup>So He brought me into the inner court of the Lord’s house; and there, at the door of the temple of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Joel 2:17">⚓</a>between the porch and the altar, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 11:1">⚓</a><i>were</i> about twenty-five men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:6; Jer. 2:27; 32:33; Ezek. 23:39">⚓</a>with their backs toward the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east, and they were worshiping <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:19; 2 Kin. 23:5, 11; Job 31:26; Jer. 44:17">⚓</a>the sun toward the east.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_8_17"> <sup>17</sup>And He said to me, “Have you seen <i>this,</i> O son of man? Is it a trivial thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 9:9; Amos 3:10; Mic. 2:2">⚓</a>filled the land with violence; then they have returned to provoke Me to anger. Indeed they put the branch to their nose. </span>
<span class="verse exe_8_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 5:13; 16:42; 24:13">⚓</a>Therefore I also will act in fury. My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 5:11; 7:4, 9; 9:5, 10">⚓</a>eye will not spare nor will I have pity; and though they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 1:28; Is. 1:15; Jer. 11:11; 14:12; Mic. 3:4; Zech. 7:13">⚓</a>cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.”<br/></span>
