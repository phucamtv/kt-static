<span class="verse exe_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then He called out in my hearing with a loud voice, saying, “Let those who have charge over the city draw near, each <i>with</i> a deadly weapon in his hand.” </span>
<span class="verse exe_9_2"><sup>2</sup>And suddenly six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his battle-ax in his hand. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 16:4; Ezek. 10:2; Rev. 15:6">⚓</a>One man among them <i>was</i> clothed with linen and had a writer’s inkhorn at his side. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_9_3"> <sup>3</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:23; 8:4; 10:4, 18; 11:22, 23">⚓</a>the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, where it had been, to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed with linen, who <i>had</i> the writer’s inkhorn at his side; </span>
<span class="verse exe_9_4"><sup>4</sup>and the Lord said to him, “Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:7, 13; Ezek. 9:6; (2 Cor. 1:22; 2 Tim. 2:19); Rev. 7:2, 3; 9:4; 14:1">⚓</a>a mark on the foreheads of the men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 119:53, 136; Jer. 13:17; Ezek. 6:11; 21:6; 2 Cor. 12:21; 2 Pet. 2:8">⚓</a>who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_9_5"> <sup>5</sup>To the others He said in my hearing, “Go after him through the city and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 7:9">⚓</a>kill; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 5:11">⚓</a>do not let your eye spare, nor have any pity. </span>
<span class="verse exe_9_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:17">⚓</a>Utterly slay old <i>and</i> young men, maidens and little children and women; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:23; Rev. 9:4">⚓</a>do not come near anyone on whom <i>is</i> the mark; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 25:29; Amos 3:2; (Luke 12:42; 1 Pet. 4:17)">⚓</a>begin at My sanctuary.” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 8:11, 12, 16">⚓</a>So they began with the elders who <i>were</i> before the temple. </span>
<span class="verse exe_9_7"><sup>7</sup>Then He said to them, “Defile the temple, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!” And they went out and killed in the city.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_9_8"> <sup>8</sup>So it was, that while they were killing them, I was left <i>alone;</i> and I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:5; 16:4, 22, 45; Josh. 7:6">⚓</a>fell on my face and cried out, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 11:13; Amos 7:2–6">⚓</a>“Ah, Lord God! Will You destroy all the remnant of Israel in pouring out Your fury on Jerusalem?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_9_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then He said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah <i>is</i> exceedingly great, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 21:16; Jer. 2:34; Ezek. 8:17">⚓</a>the land is full of bloodshed, and the city full of perversity; for they say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 22:13; Ezek. 8:12">⚓</a>‘The Lord has forsaken the land, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 10:11; Is. 29:15">⚓</a>the Lord does not see!’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_9_10"><sup>10</sup>And as for Me also, My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 65:6; Ezek. 5:11; 7:4; 8:18">⚓</a>eye will neither spare, nor will I have pity, <i>but</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 11:21; Hos. 9:7">⚓</a>I will recompense their deeds on their own head.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_9_11"> <sup>11</sup>Just then, the man clothed with linen, who <i>had</i> the inkhorn at his side, reported back and said, “I have done as You commanded me.”<br/></span>
