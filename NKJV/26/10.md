<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>The Glory Departs from the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>And I looked, and there in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:22, 26">⚓</a>firmament that was above the head of the cherubim, there appeared something like a sapphire stone, having the appearance of the likeness of a throne. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 9:2, 3; Dan. 10:5">⚓</a>Then He spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, “Go in among the wheels, under the cherub, fill your hands with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 18:10–13; Is. 6:6; Ezek. 1:13">⚓</a>coals of fire from among the cherubim, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 8:5">⚓</a>scatter <i>them</i> over the city.” And he went in as I watched.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_10_3"> <sup>3</sup>Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:10, 11">⚓</a>cloud filled the inner court. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:28">⚓</a>Then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub, <i>and</i> <i>paused</i> over the threshold of the temple; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:10; Ezek. 43:5">⚓</a>the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 11:22, 23">⚓</a>glory. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_5"><sup>5</sup>And the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Job 40:9); Ezek. 1:24; (Rev. 10:3)">⚓</a>sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard <i>even</i> in the outer court, like <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 29:3)">⚓</a>the voice of Almighty God when He speaks.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_10_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then it happened, when He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim,” that he went in and stood beside the wheels. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_7"><sup>7</sup>And the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that <i>was</i> among the cherubim, and took <i>some</i> <i>of</i> <i>it</i> and put <i>it</i> into the hands of the <i>man</i> clothed with linen, who took <i>it</i> and went out. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:8; 10:21">⚓</a>The cherubim appeared to have the form of a man’s hand under their wings.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_10_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:15">⚓</a>And when I looked, there were four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by each other cherub; the wheels appeared <i>to</i> <i>have</i> the color of a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:16">⚓</a>beryl stone. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_10"><sup>10</sup><i>As</i> <i>for</i> their appearance, all four looked alike—as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:17">⚓</a>When they went, they went toward <i>any</i> <i>of</i> their four directions; they did not turn aside when they went, but followed in the direction the head was facing. They did not turn aside when they went. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_12"><sup>12</sup>And their whole body, with their back, their hands, their wings, and the wheels that the four had, <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 4:6, 8">⚓</a>full of eyes all around. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_13"><sup>13</sup>As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “Wheel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_10_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 7:29, 36; Ezek. 1:6, 10, 11; Rev. 4:7">⚓</a>Each one had four faces: the first face <i>was</i> the face of a cherub, the second face the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_15"><sup>15</sup>And the cherubim were lifted up. This <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:3, 5">⚓</a>the living creature I saw by the River Chebar. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:19">⚓</a>When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also did not turn from beside them. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:12, 20, 21">⚓</a>When <i>the</i> <i>cherubim</i> stood still, <i>the</i> <i>wheels</i> stood still, and when <i>one</i> was lifted up, <i>the</i> <i>other</i> lifted itself up, for the spirit of the living creature <i>was</i> in them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_10_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:4">⚓</a>the glory of the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 9:12">⚓</a>departed from the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_19"><sup>19</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 11:22">⚓</a>the cherubim lifted their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight. When they went out, the wheels <i>were</i> beside them; and they stood at the door of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 11:1">⚓</a>east gate of the Lord’s house, and the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> above them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_10_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:22">⚓</a>This <i>is</i> the living creature I saw under the God of Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:1">⚓</a>by the River Chebar, and I knew they <i>were</i> cherubim. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:6, 8; 10:14; 41:18, 19">⚓</a>Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and the likeness of the hands of a man <i>was</i> under their wings. </span>
<span class="verse exe_10_22"><sup>22</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:10">⚓</a>the likeness of their faces <i>was</i> the same <i>as</i> the faces which I had seen by the River Chebar, their appearance and their persons. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:9, 12">⚓</a>They each went straight forward.<br/></span>
