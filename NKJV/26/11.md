<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>Judgment on Wicked Counselors</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:12, 14">⚓</a>the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:19">⚓</a>the East Gate of the Lord’s house, which faces eastward; and there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 8:16">⚓</a>at the door of the gate were twenty-five men, among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_2"><sup>2</sup>And He said to me: “Son of man, these <i>are</i> the men who devise iniquity and give wicked counsel in this city, </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_3"><sup>3</sup>who say, ‘<i>The</i> <i>time</i> <i>is</i> not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 12:22, 27; 2 Pet. 3:4">⚓</a>near to build houses; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:13; Ezek. 11:7, 11; 24:3, 6">⚓</a>this <i>city</i> <i>is</i> the caldron, and we <i>are</i> the meat.’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_4"><sup>4</sup>Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_11_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 2:2; 3:24">⚓</a>the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me, “Speak! ‘Thus says the Lord: “Thus you have said, O house of Israel; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 16:17; 17:10)">⚓</a>I know the things that come into your mind. </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 1:15; Ezek. 7:23; 22:2–6, 9, 12, 27">⚓</a>You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.” </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_7"><sup>7</sup>Therefore thus says the Lord God: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 24:3, 6; Mic. 3:2, 3">⚓</a>“Your slain whom you have laid in its midst, they <i>are</i> the meat, and this <i>city</i> <i>is</i> the caldron; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:18–22; Jer. 52:24–27; Ezek. 11:9">⚓</a>but I shall bring you out of the midst of it. </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_8"><sup>8</sup>You have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 42:16">⚓</a>feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you,” says the Lord God. </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_9"><sup>9</sup>“And I will bring you out of its midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 5:8">⚓</a>execute judgments on you. </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:19–21; Jer. 39:6; 52:10">⚓</a>You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:65; 2 Kin. 14:25">⚓</a>the border of Israel. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 9:16; Ezek. 6:7; 13:9, 14, 21, 23">⚓</a>Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 11:3, 7">⚓</a>This <i>city</i> shall not be your caldron, nor shall you be the meat in its midst. I will judge you at the border of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_12"><sup>12</sup>And you shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord; for you have not walked in My statutes nor executed My judgments, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 18:3, 24; Deut. 12:30, 31; Ezek. 8:10, 14, 16">⚓</a>have done according to the customs of the Gentiles which <i>are</i> all around you.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_11_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now it happened, while I was prophesying, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:5">⚓</a>Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 9:8">⚓</a>I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, “Ah, Lord God! Will You make a complete end of the remnant of Israel?”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>God Will Restore Israel</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_11_14"> <sup>14</sup>Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_15"><sup>15</sup>“Son of man, your brethren, your relatives, your countrymen, and all the house of Israel in its entirety, <i>are</i> those about whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Get far away from the Lord; this land has been given to us as a possession.’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_16"><sup>16</sup>Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Although I have cast them far off among the Gentiles, and although I have scattered them among the countries, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 90:1; 91:9; Is. 8:14; Jer. 29:7, 11">⚓</a>yet I shall be a little sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone.” ’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_17"><sup>17</sup>Therefore say, ‘Thus says the Lord God: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 11:11–16; Jer. 3:12, 18; 24:5; Ezek. 20:41, 42; 28:5">⚓</a>“I will gather you from the peoples, assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.” ’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_18"><sup>18</sup>And they will go there, and they will take away all its <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 37:23">⚓</a>detestable things and all its abominations from there. </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_19"><sup>19</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 32:39; Ezek. 36:26; Zeph. 3:9">⚓</a>I will give them one heart, and I will put <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 51:10; (Jer. 31:33); Ezek. 18:31">⚓</a>a new spirit within them, and take <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 7:12; (Rom. 2:4, 5)">⚓</a>the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh, </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 105:45">⚓</a>that they may walk in My statutes and keep My judgments and do them; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 24:7; Ezek. 14:11; 36:28; 37:27">⚓</a>and they shall be My people, and I will be their God. </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_21"><sup>21</sup>But <i>as</i> <i>for</i> <i>those</i> whose hearts follow the desire for their detestable things and their abominations, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 9:10">⚓</a>I will recompense their deeds on their own heads,” says the Lord God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_11_22"> <sup>22</sup>So the cherubim <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:19">⚓</a>lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> high above them. </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_23"><sup>23</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 8:4; 9:3">⚓</a>the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and stood <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 14:4">⚓</a>on the mountain, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 43:2">⚓</a>which <i>is</i> on the east side of the city.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_11_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 8:3; 2 Cor. 12:2–4">⚓</a>the Spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to those in captivity. And the vision that I had seen went up from me. </span>
<span class="verse exe_11_25"><sup>25</sup>So I spoke to those in captivity of all the things the Lord had shown me.<br/></span>
