<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>Judah’s Captivity Portrayed</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_2"><sup>2</sup>“Son of man, you dwell in the midst of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 1:23; Ezek. 2:3, 6–8">⚓</a>a rebellious house, which <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 6:9; 42:20; Jer. 5:21; Matt. 13:13, 14; Mark 4:12; 8:18; (Luke 8:10; John 9:39–41; 12:40); Acts 28:26; Rom. 11:8">⚓</a>has eyes to see but does not see, and ears to hear but does not hear; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 2:5">⚓</a>for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_12_3"> <sup>3</sup>“Therefore, son of man, prepare your belongings for captivity, and go into captivity by day in their sight. You shall go from your place into captivity to another place in their sight. It may be that they will consider, though they <i>are</i> a rebellious house. </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_4"><sup>4</sup>By day you shall bring out your belongings in their sight, as though going into captivity; and at evening you shall go in their sight, like those who go into captivity. </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_5"><sup>5</sup>Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry <i>your</i> <i>belongings</i> out through it. </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_6"><sup>6</sup>In their sight you shall bear <i>them</i> on <i>your</i> shoulders <i>and</i> carry <i>them</i> out at twilight; you shall cover your face, so that you cannot see the ground, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 8:18; Ezek. 4:3; 24:24">⚓</a>for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_12_7"> <sup>7</sup>So I did as I was commanded. I brought out my belongings by day, as though going into captivity, and at evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought <i>them</i> out at twilight, <i>and</i> I bore <i>them</i> on <i>my</i> shoulder in their sight.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_12_8"> <sup>8</sup>And in the morning the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_9"><sup>9</sup>“Son of man, has not the house of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 2:5">⚓</a>the rebellious house, said to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 17:12; 24:19">⚓</a>‘What are you doing?’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_10"><sup>10</sup>Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “This <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 1:1">⚓</a>burden <i>concerns</i> the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are among them.” ’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_11"><sup>11</sup>Say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 12:6">⚓</a>‘I <i>am</i> a sign to you. As I have done, so shall it be done to them; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:4, 5, 7">⚓</a>they shall be carried away into captivity.’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_12"><sup>12</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:4; Jer. 39:4; 52:7; Ezek. 12:6">⚓</a>the prince who <i>is</i> among them shall bear <i>his</i> <i>belongings</i> on <i>his</i> shoulder at twilight and go out. They shall dig through the wall to carry <i>them</i> out through it. He shall cover his face, so that he cannot see the ground with <i>his</i> eyes. </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_13"><sup>13</sup>I will also spread My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 19:6; Jer. 52:9; Lam. 1:13; Ezek. 17:20">⚓</a>net over him, and he shall be caught in My snare. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:7; Jer. 52:11; Ezek. 17:16">⚓</a>I will bring him to Babylon, <i>to</i> the land of the Chaldeans; yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there. </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:4; Ezek. 5:10">⚓</a>I will scatter to every wind all who <i>are</i> around him to help him, and all his troops; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 5:2, 12">⚓</a>I will draw out the sword after them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_12_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 9:16); Ezek. 6:7, 14; 12:16, 20">⚓</a>“Then they shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries. </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:11, 22; Ezek. 6:8–10">⚓</a>But I will spare a few of their men from the sword, from famine, and from pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the Gentiles wherever they go. Then they shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Judgment Not Postponed</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_12_17"> <sup>17</sup>Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_18"><sup>18</sup>“Son of man, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lam. 5:9; Ezek. 4:16">⚓</a>eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and anxiety. </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_19"><sup>19</sup>And say to the people of the land, ‘Thus says the Lord God to the inhabitants of Jerusalem <i>and</i> to the land of Israel: “They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink their water with dread, so that her land may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 10:22; Ezek. 6:6, 7, 14; Mic. 7:13; Zech. 7:14">⚓</a>be emptied of all who are in it, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 107:34">⚓</a>because of the violence of all those who dwell in it. </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_20"><sup>20</sup>Then the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall become desolate; and you shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_12_21"> <sup>21</sup>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_22"><sup>22</sup>“Son of man, what <i>is</i> this proverb <i>that</i> you <i>people</i> have about the land of Israel, which says, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 5:12; Ezek. 11:3; 12:27; Amos 6:3; 2 Pet. 3:4">⚓</a>‘The days are prolonged, and every vision fails’? </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_23"><sup>23</sup>Tell them therefore, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “I will lay this proverb to rest, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.” ’ But say to them, ‘ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 37:13; Joel 2:1; Zeph. 1:14">⚓</a>“The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision. </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_24"><sup>24</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 14:13–16; Ezek. 13:6; Zech. 13:2–4">⚓</a>no more shall there be any <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lam. 2:14">⚓</a>false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_25"><sup>25</sup>For I <i>am</i> the Lord. I speak, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 55:11); Dan. 9:12; (Luke 21:33)">⚓</a>the word which I speak will come to pass; it will no more be postponed; for in your days, O rebellious house, I will say the word and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:19; (Is. 14:24)">⚓</a>perform it,” says the Lord God.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_12_26"> <sup>26</sup>Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 12:22">⚓</a>“Son of man, look, the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he sees <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:14">⚓</a>for many days <i>from</i> <i>now,</i> and he prophesies of times far off.’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_12_28"><sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 12:23, 25">⚓</a>Therefore say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “None of My words will be postponed any more, but the word which I speak <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 4:7">⚓</a>will be done,” says the Lord God.’ ”<br/></span>
