<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>The Outcast Vine</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </span>
<span class="verse exe_15_2"><sup>2</sup>“Son of man, how is the wood of the vine <i>better</i> than any other wood, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest? </span>
<span class="verse exe_15_3"><sup>3</sup>Is wood taken from it to make any object? Or can <i>men</i> make a peg from it to hang any vessel on? </span>
<span class="verse exe_15_4"><sup>4</sup>Instead, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 15:6)">⚓</a>it is thrown into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both ends of it, and its middle is burned. Is it useful for <i>any</i> work? </span>
<span class="verse exe_15_5"><sup>5</sup>Indeed, when it was whole, no object could be made from it. How much less will it be useful for <i>any</i> work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned?<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_15_6"> <sup>6</sup>“Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem; </span>
<span class="verse exe_15_7"><sup>7</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:17; (Ps. 34:16); Jer. 21:10; Ezek. 14:8">⚓</a>I will set My face against them. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 24:18">⚓</a>They will go out from <i>one</i> fire, but <i>another</i> fire shall devour them. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 7:4">⚓</a>Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord, when I set My face against them. </span>
<span class="verse exe_15_8"><sup>8</sup>Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have persisted in unfaithfulness,’ says the Lord God.”<br/></span>
