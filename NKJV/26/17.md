<div class="title"><h1>17</h1><h3>The Eagles and the Vine</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse exe_17_2"><sup>2</sup>“Son of man, pose a riddle, and speak a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 20:49; 24:3">⚓</a>parable to the house of Israel, </span>
<span class="verse exe_17_3"><sup>3</sup>and say, ‘Thus says the Lord God:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 48:40; Ezek. 17:12; Hos. 8:1">⚓</a>“A great eagle with large wings and long pinions,<br/>   Full of feathers of various colors,<br/>   Came to Lebanon<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:12">⚓</a>took from the cedar the highest branch.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_17_4">   <sup>4</sup>He cropped off its topmost young twig<br/>   And carried it to a land of trade;<br/>   He set it in a city of merchants.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_17_5">   <sup>5</sup>Then he took some of the seed of the land<br/>   And planted it in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:7–9">⚓</a>a fertile field;<br/>   He placed <i>it</i> by abundant waters<br/>   <i>And</i> set it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 44:4">⚓</a>like a willow tree.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_17_6">   <sup>6</sup>And it grew and became a spreading vine <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 17:14">⚓</a>of low stature;<br/>   Its branches turned toward him,<br/>   But its roots were under it.<br/>   So it became a vine,<br/>   Brought forth branches,<br/>   And put forth shoots.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_17_7">  <sup>7</sup>“But there was another great eagle with large wings and many feathers;<br/>   And behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 17:15">⚓</a>this vine bent its roots toward him,<br/>   And stretched its branches toward him,<br/>   From the garden terrace where it had been planted,<br/>   That he might water it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_17_8">   <sup>8</sup>It was planted in good soil by many waters,<br/>   To bring forth branches, bear fruit,<br/>   <i>And</i> become a majestic vine.” ’<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_17_9"> <sup>9</sup>“Say, ‘Thus says the Lord God:<br/>  “Will it thrive?<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:7">⚓</a>Will he not pull up its roots,<br/>   Cut off its fruit,<br/>   And leave it to wither?<br/>   All of its spring leaves will wither,<br/>   And no great power or many people<br/>   Will be needed to pluck it up by its roots.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_17_10">   <sup>10</sup>Behold, <i>it</i> <i>is</i> planted,<br/>   Will it thrive?<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 19:12; Hos. 13:15">⚓</a>Will it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it?<br/>   It will wither in the garden terrace where it grew.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_17_11"> <sup>11</sup>Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse exe_17_12"><sup>12</sup>“Say now to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 2:3–5; 12:9">⚓</a>the rebellious house: ‘Do you not know what these <i>things</i> <i>mean?</i>’ Tell <i>them,</i> ‘Indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:11–16; Ezek. 1:2; 17:3">⚓</a>the king of Babylon went to Jerusalem and took its king and princes, and led them with him to Babylon. </span>
<span class="verse exe_17_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:17; Jer. 37:1; Ezek. 17:5">⚓</a>And he took the king’s offspring, made a covenant with him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:13">⚓</a>and put him under oath. He also took away the mighty of the land, </span>
<span class="verse exe_17_14"><sup>14</sup>that the kingdom might be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 29:14">⚓</a>brought low and not lift itself up, <i>but</i> that by keeping his covenant it might stand. </span>
<span class="verse exe_17_15"><sup>15</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:20; 2 Chr. 36:13; Jer. 52:3; Ezek. 17:7">⚓</a>he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:16; Is. 31:1, 3; 36:6, 9">⚓</a>that they might give him horses and many people. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 17:9">⚓</a>Will he prosper? Will he who does such <i>things</i> escape? Can he break a covenant and still be delivered?<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_17_16"> <sup>16</sup>‘<i>As</i> I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘surely <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 52:11; Ezek. 12:13">⚓</a>in the place <i>where</i> the king <i>dwells</i> who made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke—with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die. </span>
<span class="verse exe_17_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 37:7; Ezek. 29:6">⚓</a>Nor will Pharaoh with <i>his</i> mighty army and great company do anything in the war, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 52:4; Ezek. 4:2">⚓</a>when they heap up a siege mound and build a wall to cut off many persons. </span>
<span class="verse exe_17_18"><sup>18</sup>Since he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and in fact <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 29:24; Lam. 5:6">⚓</a>gave his hand and still did all these <i>things,</i> he shall not escape.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_17_19"> <sup>19</sup>Therefore thus says the Lord God: “<i>As</i> I live, surely My oath which he despised, and My covenant which he broke, I will recompense on his own head. </span>
<span class="verse exe_17_20"><sup>20</sup>I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 12:13">⚓</a>spread My net over him, and he shall be taken in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 2:35; Ezek. 20:36">⚓</a>try him there for the treason which he committed against Me. </span>
<span class="verse exe_17_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 12:14">⚓</a>All his fugitives with all his troops shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 12:15; 22:15">⚓</a>scattered to every wind; and you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel Exalted at Last</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_17_22"> <sup>22</sup>Thus says the Lord God: “I will take also <i>one</i> of the highest <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 11:1; Jer. 23:5; Zech. 3:8)">⚓</a>branches of the high cedar and set <i>it</i> out. I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:2">⚓</a>a tender one, and will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 2:6)">⚓</a>plant <i>it</i> on a high and prominent mountain. </span>
<span class="verse exe_17_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 2:2, 3); Ezek. 20:40; (Mic. 4:1)">⚓</a>On the mountain height of Israel I will plant it; and it will bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a majestic cedar. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 31:6; Dan. 4:12">⚓</a>Under it will dwell birds of every sort; in the shadow of its branches they will dwell. </span>
<span class="verse exe_17_24"><sup>24</sup>And all the trees of the field shall know that I, the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 37:3; Amos 9:11; Luke 1:52; (Rom. 11:23, 24)">⚓</a>have brought down the high tree and exalted the low tree, dried up the green tree and made the dry tree flourish; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 22:14">⚓</a>I, the Lord, have spoken and have done <i>it.</i>”<br/></span>
