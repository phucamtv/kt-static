<span class="verse exe_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>It came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth <i>month,</i> on the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 8:1, 11, 12; 14:1">⚓</a>certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord, and sat before me. </span>
<span class="verse exe_20_2"><sup>2</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse exe_20_3"><sup>3</sup>“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Have you come to inquire of Me? <i>As</i> I live,” says the Lord God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 7:26; 14:3">⚓</a>“I will not be inquired of by you.” ’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_20_4"><sup>4</sup>Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge <i>them?</i> Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 16:2; 22:2; Matt. 23:32">⚓</a>make known to them the abominations of their fathers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_20_5"> <sup>5</sup>“Say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “On the day when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:6–8; Deut. 7:6">⚓</a>I chose Israel and raised My hand in an oath to the descendants of the house of Jacob, and made Myself <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:8; 4:31; Deut. 4:34">⚓</a>known to them in the land of Egypt, I raised My hand in an oath to them, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:2">⚓</a>‘I <i>am</i> the Lord your God.’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_20_6"><sup>6</sup>On that day I raised My hand in an oath to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:8, 17; Deut. 8:7–9; Jer. 32:22">⚓</a>to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:8">⚓</a>‘flowing with milk and honey,’ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:8, 17; 13:5; 33:3; Ps. 48:2; Jer. 11:5; 32:22; Ezek. 20:15; Dan. 8:9; Zech. 7:14">⚓</a>the glory of all lands. </span>
<span class="verse exe_20_7"><sup>7</sup>Then I said to them, ‘Each of you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 18:31">⚓</a>throw away <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 15:8">⚓</a>the abominations which are before his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 18:3; Deut. 29:16; Josh. 24:14">⚓</a>the idols of Egypt.

<span class="verse exe_20_8"><sup>8</sup>But they rebelled against Me and would not obey Me. They did not all cast away the abominations which were before their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said, ‘I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 7:8">⚓</a>pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_20_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:13">⚓</a>But I acted for My name’s sake, that it should not be profaned before the Gentiles among whom they <i>were,</i> in whose sight I had made Myself <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:10; 9:9, 10">⚓</a>known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_20_10"> <sup>10</sup>“Therefore I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:18">⚓</a>made them go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. </span>
