<span class="verse exe_29_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the tenth year, in the tenth <i>month,</i> on the twelfth <i>day</i> of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse exe_29_2"><sup>2</sup>“Son of man, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 28:21">⚓</a>set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 19:1; Jer. 25:19; 46:2, 25; Ezek. 30:1—32:32; Joel 3:19">⚓</a>against all Egypt. </span>
<span class="verse exe_29_3"><sup>3</sup>Speak, and say, ‘Thus says the Lord God:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 44:30; Ezek. 28:22; 29:10">⚓</a>“Behold, I <i>am</i> against you,<br/>   O Pharaoh king of Egypt,<br/>   O great <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 74:13, 14; Is. 37:1; 51:9; Ezek. 32:2">⚓</a>monster who lies in the midst of his rivers,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 28:2">⚓</a>Who has said, ‘My River <i>is</i> my own;<br/>   I have made <i>it</i> for myself.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_29_4">   <sup>4</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:28; Is. 37:29; Ezek. 38:4">⚓</a>I will put hooks in your jaws,<br/>   And cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales;<br/>   I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers,<br/>   And all the fish in your rivers will stick to your scales.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_29_5">   <sup>5</sup>I will leave you in the wilderness,<br/>   You and all the fish of your rivers;<br/>   You shall fall on the open <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 32:4–6">⚓</a>field;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 8:2; 16:4; 25:33">⚓</a>You shall not be picked up or gathered.<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:33; 34:20; Ezek. 39:4">⚓</a>I have given you as food<br/>   To the beasts of the field<br/>   And to the birds of the heavens.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_29_6">  <sup>6</sup>“Then all the inhabitants of Egypt<br/>   Shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord,<br/>   Because they have been a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 18:21; Is. 36:6; Ezek. 17:15">⚓</a>staff of reed to the house of Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_29_7">   <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 37:5, 7, 11; Ezek. 17:17">⚓</a>When they took hold of you with the hand,<br/>   You broke and tore all their shoulders;<br/>   When they leaned on you,<br/>   You broke and made all their backs quiver.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_29_8"> <sup>8</sup>‘Therefore thus says the Lord God: “Surely I will bring <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 46:13; Ezek. 14:17; 32:11–13">⚓</a>a sword upon you and cut off from you man and beast. </span>
<span class="verse exe_29_9"><sup>9</sup>And the land of Egypt shall become <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 30:7, 8">⚓</a>desolate and waste; then they will know that I <i>am</i> the Lord, because he said, ‘The River <i>is</i> mine, and I have made <i>it.</i>’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_29_10"><sup>10</sup>Indeed, therefore, I <i>am</i> against you and against your rivers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 30:12">⚓</a>and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 30:6">⚓</a>from Migdol <i>to</i> Syene, as far as the border of Ethiopia. </span>
<span class="verse exe_29_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 43:11, 12; 46:19; Ezek. 32:13">⚓</a>Neither foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast pass through it, and it shall be uninhabited forty years. </span>
<span class="verse exe_29_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 25:15–19; 27:6–11; Ezek. 30:7, 26">⚓</a>I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries <i>that</i> <i>are</i> desolate; and among the cities <i>that</i> <i>are</i> laid waste, her cities shall be desolate forty years; and I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 46:19; Ezek. 30:23, 26">⚓</a>scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_29_13"> <sup>13</sup>‘Yet, thus says the Lord God: “At the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 19:23; Jer. 46:26">⚓</a>end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered. </span>
<span class="verse exe_29_14"><sup>14</sup>I will bring back the captives of Egypt and cause them to return to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and there they shall be a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 17:6, 14">⚓</a>lowly kingdom. </span>
<span class="verse exe_29_15"><sup>15</sup>It shall be the lowliest of kingdoms; it shall never again exalt itself above the nations, for I will diminish them so that they will not rule over the nations anymore. </span>
<span class="verse exe_29_16"><sup>16</sup>No longer shall it be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 30:2, 3; 36:4, 6; Lam. 4:17; Ezek. 17:15; 29:6">⚓</a>the confidence of the house of Israel, but will remind them of <i>their</i> iniquity when they turned to follow them.

<span class="verse exe_29_17"> <sup>17</sup>And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first <i>month,</i> on the first <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
