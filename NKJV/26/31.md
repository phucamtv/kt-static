<span class="verse exe_31_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 52:5, 6; Ezek. 30:20; 32:1">⚓</a>eleventh year, in the third <i>month,</i> on the first <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse exe_31_2"><sup>2</sup>“Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 31:18">⚓</a>‘Whom are you like in your greatness?<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_31_3">   <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 10:33, 34; Ezek. 17:3, 4, 22; 31:16; Dan. 4:10, 20–23">⚓</a>Indeed Assyria <i>was</i> a cedar in Lebanon,<br/>   With fine branches that shaded the forest,<br/>   And of high stature;<br/>   And its top was among the thick boughs.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_31_4">   <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 51:36; Ezek. 29:3–9">⚓</a>The waters made it grow;<br/>   Underground waters gave it height,<br/>   With their rivers running around the place where it was planted,<br/>   And sent out rivulets to all the trees of the field.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_31_5">  <sup>5</sup>‘Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 4:11">⚓</a>its height was exalted above all the trees of the field;<br/>   Its boughs were multiplied,<br/>   And its branches became long because of the abundance of water,<br/>   As it sent them out.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_31_6">   <sup>6</sup>All the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 17:23; 31:13; Dan. 4:12, 21; Matt. 13:32">⚓</a>birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs;<br/>   Under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young;<br/>   And in its shadow all great nations made their home.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_31_7">  <sup>7</sup>‘Thus it was beautiful in greatness and in the length of its branches,<br/>   Because its roots reached to abundant waters.<br/></span>

<span class="verse exe_31_9">   <sup>9</sup>I made it beautiful with a multitude of branches,<br/>   So that all the trees of Eden envied it,<br/>   That <i>were</i> in the garden of God.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_31_10"> <sup>10</sup>“Therefore thus says the Lord God: ‘Because you have increased in height, and it set its top among the thick boughs, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 32:25; Is. 10:12; 14:13, 14; Ezek. 28:17; Dan. 5:20">⚓</a>its heart was lifted up in its height, </span>

<span class="verse exe_31_12"><sup>12</sup>And aliens, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 28:7; 30:11; 32:12">⚓</a>the most terrible of the nations, have cut it down and left it; its branches have fallen <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 32:5; 35:8">⚓</a>on the mountains and in all the valleys; its boughs lie <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 30:24, 25">⚓</a>broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the peoples of the earth have gone from under its shadow and left it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_31_13">  <sup>13</sup>‘On <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 18:6; Ezek. 32:4">⚓</a>its ruin will remain all the birds of the heavens,<br/>   And all the beasts of the field will come to its branches—<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_31_14"> <sup>14</sup>‘So that no trees by the waters may ever again exalt themselves for their height, nor set their tops among the thick boughs, that no tree which drinks water may ever be high enough to reach up to them.<br/>  ‘For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 82:7">⚓</a>they have all been delivered to death,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 32:18">⚓</a>To the depths of the earth,<br/>   Among the children of men who go down to the Pit.’<br/></span>

I covered the deep because of it. I restrained its rivers, and the great waters were held back. I caused Lebanon to mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted because of it. </span>
<span class="verse exe_31_16"><sup>16</sup>I made the nations <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 26:15; Hag. 2:7">⚓</a>shake at the sound of its fall, when I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 14:15; Ezek. 32:18">⚓</a>cast it down to hell together with those who descend into the Pit; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 14:8; Hab. 2:17">⚓</a>all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 32:31">⚓</a>were comforted in the depths of the earth. </span>
<span class="verse exe_31_17"><sup>17</sup>They also went down to hell with it, with those slain by the sword; and <i>those</i> <i>who</i> <i>were</i> its <i>strong</i> arm <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lam. 4:20">⚓</a>dwelt in its shadows among the nations.<br/></span>
