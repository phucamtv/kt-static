<span class="verse exe_33_3"><sup>3</sup>when he sees the sword coming upon the land, if he blows the trumpet and warns the people, </span>
<span class="verse exe_33_4"><sup>4</sup>then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and does <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 25:16; Jer. 6:17; Zech. 1:4">⚓</a>not take warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 18:13; 35:9; (Acts 18:6)">⚓</a>his blood shall be on his <i>own</i> head. </span>
<span class="verse exe_33_5"><sup>5</sup>He heard the sound of the trumpet, but did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But he who takes warning will save his life. </span>

<span class="verse exe_33_8"><sup>8</sup>When I say to the wicked, ‘O wicked <i>man,</i> you shall surely die!’ and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked <i>man</i> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. </span>
<span class="verse exe_33_9"><sup>9</sup>Nevertheless if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_33_10"> <sup>10</sup>“Therefore you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: ‘Thus you say, “If our transgressions and our sins <i>lie</i> upon us, and we <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:39; Ezek. 24:23">⚓</a>pine away in them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 49:14; Ezek. 37:11">⚓</a>how can we then live?” ’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_33_11"><sup>11</sup>Say to them: ‘<i>As</i> I live,’ says the Lord God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Sam. 14:14; Lam. 3:33); Ezek. 18:23, 32; Hos. 11:8; (2 Pet. 3:9)">⚓</a>‘I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 18:21, 30; (Hos. 14:1, 4; Acts 3:19)">⚓</a>turn from his way and live.

<div class="title"><h3>The Fairness of God’s Judgment</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_33_12"> <sup>12</sup>“Therefore you, O son of man, say to the children of your people: ‘The <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:20; 18:24, 26">⚓</a>righteousness of the righteous man shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression; as for the wickedness of the wicked, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Chr. 7:14); Ezek. 8:21; 33:19">⚓</a>he shall not fall because of it in the day that he turns from his wickedness; nor shall the righteous be able to live because of <i>his</i> <i>righteousness</i> in the day that he sins.’ </span>
