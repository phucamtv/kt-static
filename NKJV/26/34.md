<span class="verse exe_34_2"><sup>2</sup>“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God to the shepherds: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 23:1; Ezek. 22:25; Mic. 3:1–3, 11; Zech. 11:17">⚓</a>“Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves!
