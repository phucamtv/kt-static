<span class="verse exe_36_13"> <sup>13</sup>‘Thus says the Lord God: “Because they say to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 13:32">⚓</a>‘You devour men and bereave your nation <i>of</i> <i>children,</i>’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_36_14"><sup>14</sup>therefore you shall devour men no more, nor bereave your nation anymore,” says the Lord God. </span>
