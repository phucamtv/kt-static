<div class="title"><h1>37</h1><h3>The Dry Bones Live</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_37_1"> <sup>1</sup>The <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:3">⚓</a>hand of the Lord came upon me and brought me out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:14; 8:3; 11:24; Acts 8:39">⚓</a>in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it <i>was</i> full of bones. </span>
<span class="verse exe_37_2"><sup>2</sup>Then He caused me to pass by them all around, and behold, <i>there</i> <i>were</i> very many in the open valley; and indeed <i>they</i> <i>were</i> very dry. </span>
<span class="verse exe_37_3"><sup>3</sup>And He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?”<br/> So I answered, “O Lord God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 32:39; 1 Sam. 2:6; John 5:21; Rom. 4:17; 2 Cor. 1:9)">⚓</a>You know.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_37_4"> <sup>4</sup>Again He said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, ‘O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord! </span>
<span class="verse exe_37_5"><sup>5</sup>Thus says the Lord God to these bones: “Surely I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:7; Ps. 104:29, 30; Ezek. 37:9, 10, 14">⚓</a>cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live. </span>
<span class="verse exe_37_6"><sup>6</sup>I will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you, cover you with skin and put breath in you; and you shall live. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 49:23; Ezek. 6:7; 35:12; Joel 2:27; 3:17">⚓</a>Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_37_7"> <sup>7</sup>So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and suddenly a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to bone. </span>
<span class="verse exe_37_8"><sup>8</sup>Indeed, as I looked, the sinews and the flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them over; but <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no breath in them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_37_9"> <sup>9</sup>Also He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, ‘Thus says the Lord God: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 104:30)">⚓</a>“Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.” ’ ” </span>
<span class="verse exe_37_10"><sup>10</sup>So I prophesied as He commanded me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 11:11">⚓</a>and breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_37_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 33:24; Ezek. 36:10">⚓</a>whole house of Israel. They indeed say, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 141:7; Is. 49:14">⚓</a>‘Our bones are dry, our hope is lost, and we ourselves are cut off!’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_37_12"><sup>12</sup>Therefore prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:39; 1 Sam. 2:6; Is. 26:19; 66:14; (Dan. 12:2); Hos. 13:14">⚓</a>O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to come up from your graves, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 36:24">⚓</a>bring you into the land of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse exe_37_13"><sup>13</sup>Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O My people, and brought you up from your graves. </span>
<span class="verse exe_37_14"><sup>14</sup>I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 32:15; Ezek. 36:27; (Joel 2:28, 29); Zech. 12:10">⚓</a>will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken <i>it</i> and performed <i>it,</i>” says the Lord.’ ”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>One Kingdom, One King</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_37_15"> <sup>15</sup>Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse exe_37_16"><sup>16</sup>“As for you, son of man, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 17:2, 3">⚓</a>take a stick for yourself and write on it: ‘For Judah and for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 11:12, 13, 16; 15:9; 30:11, 18">⚓</a>the children of Israel, his companions.’ Then take another stick and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and <i>for</i> all the house of Israel, his companions.’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_37_17"><sup>17</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 11:13; Jer. 50:4; Ezek. 37:22–24; Hos. 1:11; Zeph. 3:9">⚓</a>join them one to another for yourself into one stick, and they will become one in your hand.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_37_18"> <sup>18</sup>“And when the children of your people speak to you, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 12:9; 24:19">⚓</a>‘Will you not show us what you <i>mean</i> by these?’— </span>
<span class="verse exe_37_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 10:6">⚓</a>say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Surely I will take <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 37:16, 17">⚓</a>the stick of Joseph, which <i>is</i> in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions; and I will join them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in My hand.” ’ </span>
<span class="verse exe_37_20"><sup>20</sup>And the sticks on which you write will be in your hand <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 12:3">⚓</a>before their eyes.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_37_21"> <sup>21</sup>“Then say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Surely <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 43:5, 6; Jer. 32:37; Ezek. 36:24; Amos 9:14, 15">⚓</a>I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, wherever they have gone, and will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land; </span>
