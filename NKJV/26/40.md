<div class="title"><h1>40</h1><h3>A New City, a New Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_40_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, in the fourteenth year after <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 25:1–4; Jer. 39:2, 3; 52:4–7; Ezek. 33:21">⚓</a>the city was captured, on the very same day <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:3; 3:14, 22; 37:1">⚓</a>the hand of the Lord was upon me; and He took me there. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:1; 3:14; 8:3; 37:1; Dan. 7:1, 7">⚓</a>In the visions of God He took me into the land of Israel and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 2:2, 3); Ezek. 17:23; 20:40; 37:22; (Mic. 4:1); Rev. 21:10">⚓</a>set me on a very high mountain; on it toward the south <i>was</i> something like the structure of a city. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_3"><sup>3</sup>He took me there, and behold, <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a man whose appearance <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:7; Dan. 10:6; Rev. 1:15">⚓</a>like the appearance of bronze. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 47:3; Zech. 2:1, 2">⚓</a>He had a line of flax <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 11:1; 21:15">⚓</a>and a measuring rod in his hand, and he stood in the gateway.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_40_4"> <sup>4</sup>And the man said to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 44:5">⚓</a>“Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears, and fix your mind on everything I show you; for you <i>were</i> brought here so that I might show <i>them</i> to you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 43:10">⚓</a>Declare to the house of Israel everything you see.” </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_5"><sup>5</sup>Now there was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 26:1); Ezek. 42:20">⚓</a>a wall all around the outside of the temple. In the man’s hand was a measuring rod six cubits <i>long, each being a</i> cubit and a handbreadth; and he measured the width of the wall structure, one rod; and the height, one rod.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Eastern Gateway of the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_40_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then he went to the gateway which faced <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 43:1">⚓</a>east; and he went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gateway, <i>which</i> <i>was</i> one rod wide, and the other threshold <i>was</i> one rod wide. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_7"><sup>7</sup>Each gate chamber <i>was</i> one rod long and one rod wide; between the gate chambers <i>was</i> <i>a</i> <i>space</i> <i>of</i> five cubits; and the threshold of the gateway by the vestibule of the inside gate <i>was</i> one rod. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_8"><sup>8</sup>He also measured the vestibule of the inside gate, one rod. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_9"><sup>9</sup>Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; and the gateposts, two cubits. The vestibule of the gate <i>was</i> on the inside. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_10"><sup>10</sup>In the eastern gateway <i>were</i> three gate chambers on one side and three on the other; the three <i>were</i> all the same size; also the gateposts were of the same size on this side and that side.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_40_11"> <sup>11</sup>He measured the width of the entrance to the gateway, ten cubits; <i>and</i> the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_12"><sup>12</sup><i>There</i> <i>was</i> a space in front of the gate chambers, one cubit <i>on</i> <i>this</i> <i>side</i> and one cubit on that side; the gate chambers <i>were</i> six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_13"><sup>13</sup>Then he measured the gateway from the roof of <i>one</i> gate chamber to the roof of the other; the width <i>was</i> twenty-five cubits, as door faces door. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_14"><sup>14</sup>He measured the gateposts, sixty cubits high, and the court all around the gateway <i>extended</i> to the gatepost. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_15"><sup>15</sup><i>From</i> the front of the entrance gate to the front of the vestibule of the inner gate <i>was</i> fifty cubits. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_16"><sup>16</sup><i>There</i> <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:4; Ezek. 41:16, 26">⚓</a>beveled window <i>frames</i> in the gate chambers and in their intervening archways on the inside of the gateway all around, and likewise in the vestibules. <i>There</i> <i>were</i> windows all around on the inside. And on each gatepost <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:29, 32, 35; 2 Chr. 3:5; Ezek. 40:22, 26, 31, 34, 37; 41:18–20, 25, 26">⚓</a>palm trees.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Outer Court</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_40_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then he brought me into <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:5; 42:1; 46:21; Rev. 11:2">⚓</a>the outer court; and <i>there</i> <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:5; 2 Chr. 31:11; Ezek. 40:38">⚓</a>chambers and a pavement made all around the court; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 45:5">⚓</a>thirty chambers faced the pavement. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_18"><sup>18</sup>The pavement was by the side of the gateways, corresponding to the length of the gateways; <i>this</i> <i>was</i> the lower pavement. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_19"><sup>19</sup>Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gateway to the front of the inner court exterior, one hundred cubits toward the east and the north.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Northern Gateway</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_40_20"> <sup>20</sup>On the outer court was also a gateway facing north, and he measured its length and its width. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_21"><sup>21</sup>Its gate chambers, three on this side and three on that side, its gateposts and its archways, had the same measurements as the first gate; its length <i>was</i> fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_22"><sup>22</sup>Its windows and those of its archways, and also its palm trees, <i>had</i> the same measurements as the gateway facing east; it was ascended by seven steps, and its archway <i>was</i> in front of it. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_23"><sup>23</sup>A gate of the inner court was opposite the northern gateway, just as the eastern <i>gateway;</i> and he measured from gateway to gateway, one hundred cubits.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Southern Gateway</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_40_24"> <sup>24</sup>After that he brought me toward the south, and there a gateway was facing south; and he measured its gateposts and archways according to these same measurements. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_25"><sup>25</sup><i>There</i> <i>were</i> windows in it and in its archways all around like those windows; its length <i>was</i> fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_26"><sup>26</sup>Seven steps led up to it, and its archway <i>was</i> in front of them; and it had palm trees on its gateposts, one on this side and one on that side. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_27"><sup>27</sup><i>There</i> <i>was</i> also a gateway on the inner court, facing south; and he measured from gateway to gateway toward the south, one hundred cubits.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Gateways of the Inner Court</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_40_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then he brought me to the inner court through the southern gateway; he measured the southern gateway according to these same measurements. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_29"><sup>29</sup>Also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways <i>were</i> according to these same measurements; <i>there</i> <i>were</i> windows in it and in its archways all around; <i>it</i> <i>was</i> fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_30"><sup>30</sup><i>There</i> <i>were</i> archways all around, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:21, 25, 33, 36">⚓</a>twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_31"><sup>31</sup>Its archways faced the outer court, palm trees <i>were</i> on its gateposts, and going up to it <i>were</i> eight steps.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_40_32"> <sup>32</sup>And he brought me into the inner court facing east; he measured the gateway according to these same measurements. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_33"><sup>33</sup>Also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways <i>were</i> according to these same measurements; and <i>there</i> <i>were</i> windows in it and in its archways all around; <i>it</i> <i>was</i> fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_34"><sup>34</sup>Its archways faced the outer court, and palm trees <i>were</i> on its gateposts on this side and on that side; and going up to it <i>were</i> eight steps.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_40_35"> <sup>35</sup>Then he brought me to the north gateway and measured <i>it</i> according to these same measurements— </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_36"><sup>36</sup>also its gate chambers, its gateposts, and its archways. It had windows all around; its length <i>was</i> fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_37"><sup>37</sup>Its gateposts faced the outer court, palm trees <i>were</i> on its gateposts on this side and on that side, and going up to it <i>were</i> eight steps.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Where Sacrifices Were Prepared</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_40_38"> <sup>38</sup><i>There</i> <i>was</i> a chamber and its entrance by the gateposts of the gateway, where they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 4:6">⚓</a>washed the burnt offering. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_39"><sup>39</sup>In the vestibule of the gateway <i>were</i> two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which to slay the burnt offering, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 4:2, 3">⚓</a>the sin offering, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 5:6; 6:6; 7:1">⚓</a>the trespass offering. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_40"><sup>40</sup>At the outer side of the <i>vestibule</i>, as one goes up to the entrance of the northern gateway, <i>were</i> two tables; and on the other side of the vestibule of the gateway <i>were</i> two tables. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_41"><sup>41</sup>Four tables <i>were</i> on this side and four tables on that side, by the side of the gateway, eight tables on which they slaughtered <i>the</i> <i>sacrifices.</i></span>
<span class="verse exe_40_42"><sup>42</sup><i>There</i> <i>were</i> also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, one cubit and a half long, one cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high; on these they laid the instruments with which they slaughtered the burnt offering and the sacrifice. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_43"><sup>43</sup>Inside <i>were</i> hooks, a handbreadth wide, fastened all around; and the flesh of the sacrifices <i>was</i> on the tables.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Chambers for Singers and Priests</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_40_44"> <sup>44</sup>Outside the inner gate <i>were</i> the chambers for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 6:31, 32; 16:41–43; 25:1–7">⚓</a>the singers in the inner court, one facing south at the side of the northern gateway, and the other facing north at the side of the southern gateway. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_45"><sup>45</sup>Then he said to me, “This chamber which faces south <i>is</i> for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 8:35; Num. 3:27, 28, 32, 38; 18:5; 1 Chr. 9:23; 2 Chr. 13:11; Ps. 134:1">⚓</a>the priests who have charge of the temple. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_46"><sup>46</sup>The chamber which faces north <i>is</i> for the priests <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 6:12, 13; Num. 18:5; Ezek. 44:15">⚓</a>who have charge of the altar; these <i>are</i> the sons of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:35; Ezek. 43:19; 44:15, 16">⚓</a>Zadok, from the sons of Levi, who come near the Lord to minister to Him.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Dimensions of the Inner Court and Vestibule</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_40_47"> <sup>47</sup>And he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, foursquare. The altar <i>was</i> in front of the temple. </span>
<span class="verse exe_40_48"><sup>48</sup>Then he brought me to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:3; 2 Chr. 3:4">⚓</a>vestibule of the temple and measured the doorposts of the vestibule, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the width of the gateway was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side. </span>
