<div class="title"><h1>41</h1><h3>Dimensions of the Sanctuary</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_41_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:2, 3, 17">⚓</a>brought me into the sanctuary and measured the doorposts, six cubits wide on one side and six cubits wide on the other side—the width of the tabernacle. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_2"><sup>2</sup>The width of the entryway <i>was</i> ten cubits, and the side walls of the entrance <i>were</i> five cubits on this side and five cubits on the other side; and he measured its length, forty cubits, and its width, twenty cubits.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_3"> <sup>3</sup>Also he went inside and measured the doorposts, two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits <i>high;</i> and the width of the entrance, seven cubits. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:20; 2 Chr. 3:8">⚓</a>He measured the length, twenty cubits; and the width, twenty cubits, beyond the sanctuary; and he said to me, “This <i>is</i> the Most Holy <i>Place.</i>”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Side Chambers on the Wall</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_41_5"> <sup>5</sup>Next, he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits. The width of each side chamber all around the temple <i>was</i> four cubits on every side. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:5–10">⚓</a>The side chambers <i>were</i> in three stories, one above the other, thirty chambers in each story; they rested on ledges which <i>were</i> for the side chambers all around, that they might be supported, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:6, 10">⚓</a>not fastened to the wall of the temple. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_7"><sup>7</sup>As one went up from story to story, the side chambers <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:8">⚓</a>became wider all around, because their supporting ledges in the wall of the temple ascended like steps; therefore the width of the structure increased as one went up <i>from</i> the lowest <i>story</i> to the highest by way of the middle one. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_8"><sup>8</sup>I also saw an elevation all around the temple; it was the foundation of the side chambers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:5">⚓</a>a full rod, <i>that</i> <i>is,</i> six cubits <i>high.</i></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_9"><sup>9</sup>The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers <i>was</i> five cubits, and so also the remaining terrace by the place of the side chambers of the temple. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_10"><sup>10</sup>And between <i>it</i> <i>and</i> the <i>wall</i> chambers was a width of twenty cubits all around the temple on every side. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_11"><sup>11</sup>The doors of the side chambers opened on the terrace, one door toward the north and another toward the south; and the width of the terrace <i>was</i> five cubits all around.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Building at the Western End</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_41_12"> <sup>12</sup>The building that faced the separating courtyard at its western end <i>was</i> seventy cubits wide; the wall of the building <i>was</i> five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Dimensions and Design of the Temple Area</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_41_13"> <sup>13</sup>So he measured the temple, one <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:47">⚓</a>hundred cubits long; and the separating courtyard with the building and its walls <i>was</i> one hundred cubits long; </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_14"><sup>14</sup>also the width of the eastern face of the temple, including the separating courtyard, <i>was</i> one hundred cubits. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_15"><sup>15</sup>He measured the length of the building behind it, facing the separating courtyard, with its <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 42:3, 5">⚓</a>galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits, as well as the inner temple and the porches of the court, </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_16"><sup>16</sup>their doorposts and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:4; Ezek. 40:16, 25">⚓</a>the beveled window frames. And the galleries all around their three stories opposite the threshold were paneled with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:15">⚓</a>wood from the ground to the windows—the windows were covered— </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_17"><sup>17</sup>from the space above the door, even to the inner room, as well as outside, and on every wall all around, inside and outside, by measure.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_18"> <sup>18</sup>And <i>it</i> <i>was</i> made <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:29; 2 Chr. 3:7">⚓</a>with cherubim and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 3:5; Ezek. 40:16">⚓</a>palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. <i>Each</i> cherub had two faces, </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:10; 10:14">⚓</a>so that the face of a man <i>was</i> toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion toward a palm tree on the other side; thus <i>it</i> <i>was</i> made throughout the temple all around. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_20"><sup>20</sup>From the floor to the space above the door, and on the wall of the sanctuary, cherubim and palm trees <i>were</i> carved.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_21"> <sup>21</sup>The <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:33; Ezek. 40:9, 14, 16; 41:1">⚓</a>doorposts of the temple <i>were</i> square, <i>as</i> <i>was</i> the front of the sanctuary; their appearance was similar. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:1–3; 1 Kin. 6:20; Rev. 8:3">⚓</a>The altar <i>was</i> of wood, three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its length, and its sides <i>were</i> of wood; and he said to me, “This <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:23, 30; Lev. 24:6; Ezek. 23:41; 44:16; Mal. 1:7, 12">⚓</a>the table that <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:8">⚓</a>before the Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_23"> <sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:31–35">⚓</a>The temple and the sanctuary had two doors. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_24"><sup>24</sup>The doors had two <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 6:34">⚓</a>panels <i>apiece,</i> two folding panels: two <i>panels</i> for one door and two panels for the other <i>door.</i></span>
<span class="verse exe_41_25"><sup>25</sup>Cherubim and palm trees <i>were</i> carved on the doors of the temple just as they <i>were</i> carved on the walls. A wooden canopy <i>was</i> on the front of the vestibule outside. </span>
<span class="verse exe_41_26"><sup>26</sup><i>There</i> <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:16">⚓</a>beveled window <i>frames</i> and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the vestibule—also on the side chambers of the temple and on the canopies.<br/></span>
