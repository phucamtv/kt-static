<div class="title"><h1>42</h1><h3>The Chambers for the Priests</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_42_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 41:1">⚓</a>brought me out into the outer court, by the way toward the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:20">⚓</a>north; and he brought me into <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 41:12, 15">⚓</a>the chamber which <i>was</i> opposite the separating courtyard, and which <i>was</i> opposite the building toward the north. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_2"><sup>2</sup>Facing the length, <i>which</i> <i>was</i> one hundred cubits (the width was fifty cubits), was the north door. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_3"><sup>3</sup>Opposite the inner court of twenty <i>cubits,</i> and opposite the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:17">⚓</a>pavement of the outer court, <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 41:15, 16; 42:5">⚓</a>gallery against gallery in three <i>stories.</i></span>
<span class="verse exe_42_4"><sup>4</sup>In front of the chambers, toward the inside, <i>was</i> a walk ten cubits wide, at a distance of one cubit; and their doors faced north. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_5"><sup>5</sup>Now the upper chambers <i>were</i> shorter, because the galleries took away <i>space</i> from them more than from the lower and middle stories of the building. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_6"><sup>6</sup>For they <i>were</i> in three <i>stories</i> and did not have pillars like the pillars of the courts; therefore <i>the</i> <i>upper</i> <i>level</i> was shortened more than the lower and middle levels from the ground up. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_7"><sup>7</sup>And a wall which <i>was</i> outside ran parallel to the chambers, at the front of the chambers, toward the outer court; its length <i>was</i> fifty cubits. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_8"><sup>8</sup>The length of the chambers toward the outer court <i>was</i> fifty cubits, whereas that facing the temple <i>was</i> one <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 41:13, 14">⚓</a>hundred cubits. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_9"><sup>9</sup>At the lower chambers <i>was</i> the entrance on the east side, as one goes into them from the outer court.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_42_10"> <sup>10</sup>Also <i>there</i> <i>were</i> chambers in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, opposite the separating courtyard and opposite the building. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 42:4">⚓</a><i>There</i> <i>was</i> a walk in front of them also, and their appearance <i>was</i> like the chambers which <i>were</i> toward the north; they <i>were</i> as long and as wide as the others, and all their exits and entrances <i>were</i> according to plan. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_12"><sup>12</sup>And corresponding to the doors of the chambers that <i>were</i> facing south, as one enters them, <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a door in front of the walk, the way directly in front of the wall toward the east.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_42_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then he said to me, “The north chambers <i>and</i> the south chambers, which <i>are</i> opposite the separating courtyard, <i>are</i> the holy chambers where the priests who approach the Lord<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 6:16, 26; 24:9; Ezek. 43:19">⚓</a>shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall lay the most holy offerings—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 2:3, 10; 6:14, 17, 25">⚓</a>the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering—for the place <i>is</i> holy. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 44:19">⚓</a>When the priests enter them, they shall not go out of the holy <i>chamber</i> into the outer court; but there they shall leave their garments in which they minister, for they <i>are</i> holy. They shall put on other garments; then they may approach <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> for the people.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Outer Dimensions of the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_42_15"> <sup>15</sup>Now when he had finished measuring the inner temple, he brought me out through the gateway that faces toward the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:6; 43:1">⚓</a>east, and measured it all around. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_16"><sup>16</sup>He measured the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_17"><sup>17</sup>He measured the north side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_18"><sup>18</sup>He measured the south side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_19"><sup>19</sup>He came around to the west side <i>and</i> measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod. </span>
<span class="verse exe_42_20"><sup>20</sup>He measured it on the four sides; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 60:18); Ezek. 40:5; Zech. 2:5">⚓</a>it had a wall all around, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 45:2; Rev. 21:16">⚓</a>five hundred <i>cubits</i> long and five hundred wide, to separate the holy areas from the common.<br/></span>
