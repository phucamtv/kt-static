<div class="title"><h1>43</h1><h3>The Temple, the Lord’s Dwelling Place</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_43_1"> <sup>1</sup>Afterward he brought me to the gate, the gate <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:19; 46:1">⚓</a>that faces toward the east. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 11:23">⚓</a>And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:24; Rev. 1:15; 14:2">⚓</a>His voice <i>was</i> like the sound of many waters; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:4; Rev. 18:1">⚓</a>and the earth shone with His glory. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_3"><sup>3</sup><i>It</i> <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:4–28">⚓</a>like the appearance of the vision which I saw—like the vision which I saw when I came <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:10; Ezek. 9:1, 5; 32:18">⚓</a>to destroy the city. The visions <i>were</i> like the vision which I saw <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:28; 3:23">⚓</a>by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 10:19; 11:23">⚓</a>And the glory of the Lord came into the temple by way of the gate which faces toward the east. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:12, 14; 8:3; 2 Cor. 12:2–4">⚓</a>The Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:34; 1 Kin. 8:10, 11">⚓</a>the glory of the Lord filled the temple.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_43_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then I heard <i>Him</i> speaking to me from the temple, while <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:26; 40:3">⚓</a>a man stood beside me. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_7"><sup>7</sup>And He said to me, “Son of man, <i>this</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 99:1; Is. 60:13">⚓</a>the place of My throne and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 28:2; Ps. 99:5">⚓</a>the place of the soles of My feet, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:45; Ps. 68:16; 132:14; Ezek. 37:26–28; Joel 3:17; (John 1:14; 2 Cor. 6:16)">⚓</a>where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 39:7">⚓</a>No more shall the house of Israel defile My holy name, they nor their kings, by their harlotry or with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:30; Jer. 16:18; Ezek. 6:5, 13">⚓</a>the carcasses of their kings on their high places. </span>

<span class="verse exe_43_9"><sup>9</sup>Now let them put their harlotry and the carcasses of their kings far away from Me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_43_10"> <sup>10</sup>“Son of man, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:4">⚓</a>describe the temple to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_11"><sup>11</sup>And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the temple and its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, its entire design and all its <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 44:5">⚓</a>ordinances, all its forms and all its laws. Write <i>it</i> down in their sight, so that they may keep its whole design and all its ordinances, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 11:20">⚓</a>perform them. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_12"><sup>12</sup>This <i>is</i> the law of the temple: The whole area surrounding <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:2">⚓</a>the mountaintop <i>is</i> most holy. Behold, this <i>is</i> the law of the temple.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Dimensions of the Altar</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_43_13"> <sup>13</sup>“These are the measurements of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 27:1–8; 2 Chr. 4:1">⚓</a>altar in cubits <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 41:8">⚓</a>(the cubit <i>is</i> one cubit and a handbreadth): the base one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim all around its edge of one span. This <i>is</i> the height of the altar: </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_14"><sup>14</sup>from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits; the width of the ledge, one cubit; from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits; and the width of the ledge, <i>one</i> cubit. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_15"><sup>15</sup>The altar hearth <i>is</i> four cubits high, with four <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 27:2; Lev. 9:9; 1 Kin. 1:50">⚓</a>horns extending upward from the hearth. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_16"><sup>16</sup>The altar hearth <i>is</i> twelve <i>cubits</i> long, twelve wide, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 27:1">⚓</a>square at its four corners; </span>

<div class="title"><h3>Consecrating the Altar</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_43_18"> <sup>18</sup>And He said to me, “Son of man, thus says the Lord God: ‘These <i>are</i> the ordinances for the altar on the day when it is made, for sacrificing <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 40:29">⚓</a>burnt offerings on it, and for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 1:5, 11; (Heb. 9:21, 22)">⚓</a>sprinkling blood on it. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_19"><sup>19</sup>You shall give <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:10; Lev. 8:14; Ezek. 45:18, 19">⚓</a>a young bull for a sin offering to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 44:15, 16">⚓</a>the priests, the Levites, who are of the seed of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 2:35; Ezek. 40:46">⚓</a>Zadok, who approach Me to minister to Me,’ says the Lord God. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_20"><sup>20</sup>‘You shall take some of its blood and put <i>it</i> on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim around it; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_21"><sup>21</sup>Then you shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:14; Lev. 4:12">⚓</a>burn it in the appointed place of the temple, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 13:11">⚓</a>outside the sanctuary. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_22"><sup>22</sup>On the second day you shall offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed <i>it</i> with the bull. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_23"><sup>23</sup>When you have finished cleansing <i>it,</i> you shall offer a young bull without blemish, and a ram from the flock without blemish. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_24"><sup>24</sup>When you offer them before the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 2:13; Num. 18:19; (Mark 9:49, 50; Col. 4:6)">⚓</a>the priests shall throw salt on them, and they will offer them up <i>as</i> a burnt offering to the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_25"><sup>25</sup>Every day for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:35; Lev. 8:33">⚓</a>seven days you shall prepare a goat <i>for</i> a sin offering; they shall also prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without blemish. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_26"><sup>26</sup>Seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it, and so consecrate it. </span>
<span class="verse exe_43_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 9:1–4">⚓</a>When these days are over it shall be, on the eighth day and thereafter, that the priests shall offer your burnt offerings and your peace offerings on the altar; and I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 20:40, 41; (Rom. 12:1; 1 Pet. 2:5)">⚓</a>accept you,’ says the Lord God.”<br/></span>
