<div class="title"><h1>47</h1><h3>The Healing Waters and Trees</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_47_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then he brought me back to the door of the temple; and there was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 46:4; Is. 30:25; 55:1; (Jer. 2:13); Joel 3:18; Zech. 13:1; 14:8; (Rev. 22:1, 17)">⚓</a>water, flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east, for the front of the temple faced east; the water was flowing from under the right side of the temple, south of the altar. </span>
<span class="verse exe_47_2"><sup>2</sup>He brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me around on the outside to the outer gateway that faces <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 44:1, 2">⚓</a>east; and there was water, running out on the right side.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_47_3"> <sup>3</sup>And when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 40:3">⚓</a>the man went out to the east with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the water <i>came</i> <i>up</i> <i>to</i> <i>my</i> ankles. </span>
<span class="verse exe_47_4"><sup>4</sup>Again he measured one thousand and brought me through the waters; the water <i>came</i> <i>up</i> <i>to</i> <i>my</i> knees. Again he measured one thousand and brought me through; the water <i>came</i> <i>up</i> <i>to</i> <i>my</i> waist. </span>
<span class="verse exe_47_5"><sup>5</sup>Again he measured one thousand, <i>and</i> <i>it</i> <i>was</i> a river that I could not cross; for the water was too deep, water in which one must swim, a river that could not be crossed. </span>
<span class="verse exe_47_6"><sup>6</sup>He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen <i>this?</i>” Then he brought me and returned me to the bank of the river.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_47_7"> <sup>7</sup>When I returned, there, along the bank of the river, <i>were</i> very many <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 60:13, 21; 61:3; Ezek. 47:12; Rev. 22:2)">⚓</a>trees on one side and the other. </span>
<span class="verse exe_47_8"><sup>8</sup>Then he said to me: “This water flows toward the eastern region, goes down into the valley, and enters the sea. <i>When</i> <i>it</i> reaches the sea, <i>its</i> waters are healed. </span>
<span class="verse exe_47_9"><sup>9</sup>And it shall be <i>that</i> every living thing that moves, wherever the rivers go, will live. There will be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters go there; for they will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river goes. </span>
<span class="verse exe_47_10"><sup>10</sup>It shall be <i>that</i> fishermen will stand by it from En Gedi to En Eglaim; they will be <i>places</i> for spreading their nets. Their fish will be of the same kinds as the fish <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 34:3; Josh. 23:4; Ezek. 48:28">⚓</a>of the Great Sea, exceedingly many. </span>
<span class="verse exe_47_11"><sup>11</sup>But its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be given over to salt. </span>
<span class="verse exe_47_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 47:7; (Rev. 22:2)">⚓</a>Along the bank of the river, on this side and that, will grow all <i>kinds</i> <i>of</i> trees used for food; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 18:16; (Ps. 1:3; Jer. 17:8)">⚓</a>their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. They will bear fruit every month, because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rev. 22:2)">⚓</a>medicine.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Borders of the Land</h3></div>
<span class="verse exe_47_13"> <sup>13</sup>Thus says the Lord God: “These <i>are</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 34:1–29">⚓</a>borders by which you shall divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:5; 1 Chr. 5:1; Ezek. 48:4, 5">⚓</a>Joseph <i>shall</i> <i>have</i> <i>two</i> portions. </span>
<span class="verse exe_47_14"><sup>14</sup>You shall inherit it equally with one another; for I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 15:7; 17:8; 26:3; 28:13; Deut. 1:8; Ezek. 20:5, 6, 28, 42">⚓</a>raised My hand in an oath to give it to your fathers, and this land shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 48:29">⚓</a>fall to you as your inheritance.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_47_15"> <sup>15</sup>“This <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> the border of the land on the north: from the Great Sea, <i>by</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 48:1">⚓</a>the road to Hethlon, as one goes to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 34:7, 8">⚓</a>Zedad, </span>

<span class="verse exe_47_18"> <sup>18</sup>“On the east side you shall mark out the border from between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel, along the Jordan, and along the eastern side of the sea. <i>This</i> <i>is</i> the east side.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_47_19"> <sup>19</sup>“The south side, toward the South, <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> from Tamar to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:13; Deut. 32:51; Ps. 81:7; Ezek. 48:28">⚓</a>the waters of Meribah by Kadesh, along the brook to the Great Sea. <i>This</i> <i>is</i> the south side, toward the South.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_47_20"> <sup>20</sup>“The west side <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> the Great Sea, from the <i>southern</i> boundary until one comes to a point opposite Hamath. This <i>is</i> the west side.<br/></span>
<span class="verse exe_47_21"> <sup>21</sup>“Thus you shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 45:1">⚓</a>divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse exe_47_22"><sup>22</sup>It shall be that you will divide it by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 26:55, 56">⚓</a>lot as an inheritance for yourselves, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 3:6; Rev. 7:9, 10)">⚓</a>and for the strangers who dwell among you and who bear children among you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 11:18; 15:9; Gal. 3:28; Eph. 2:12–14; Col. 3:11)">⚓</a>They shall be to you as native-born among the children of Israel; they shall have an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse exe_47_23"><sup>23</sup>And it shall be <i>that</i> in whatever tribe the stranger dwells, there you shall give <i>him</i> his inheritance,” says the Lord God.<br/></span>
