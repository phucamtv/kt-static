<span class="verse da_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the third year of the reign of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 24:1, 2; 2 Chr. 36:5–7; Jer. 25:1; 52:12–30">⚓</a>Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. </span>
<span class="verse da_1_2"><sup>2</sup>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:7; Jer. 27:19, 20; Dan. 5:2">⚓</a>some of the articles of the house of God, which he carried <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 10:10; 11:2; Is. 11:11; Zech. 5:11">⚓</a>into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:7">⚓</a>and he brought the articles into the treasure house of his god.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_1_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then the king instructed Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, to bring <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:17, 18; Is. 39:7">⚓</a>some of the children of Israel and some of the king’s descendants and some of the nobles, </span>
<span class="verse da_1_4"><sup>4</sup>young men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 24:19, 20">⚓</a>in whom <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no blemish, but good-looking, gifted in all wisdom, possessing knowledge and quick to understand, who <i>had</i> ability to serve in the king’s palace, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:22">⚓</a>whom they might teach the language and literature of the Chaldeans. </span>
<span class="verse da_1_5"><sup>5</sup>And the king appointed for them a daily provision of the king’s delicacies and of the wine which he drank, and three years of training for them, so that at the end of <i>that</i> <i>time</i> they might <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:46; 1 Sam. 16:22; 1 Kin. 10:8; Dan. 1:19">⚓</a>serve before the king. </span>
<span class="verse da_1_6"><sup>6</sup>Now from among those of the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. </span>
<span class="verse da_1_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:45; 2 Kin. 24:17">⚓</a>To them the chief of the eunuchs gave names: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:26; 4:8; 5:12">⚓</a>he gave Daniel <i>the</i> <i>name</i> Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abed-Nego.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_1_8"> <sup>8</sup>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:47; Deut. 32:38; Ezek. 4:13; Hos. 9:3">⚓</a>with the portion of the king’s delicacies, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the chief of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. </span>
<span class="verse da_1_9"><sup>9</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:21; 1 Kin. 8:50; (Job 5:15, 16); Ps. 106:46; (Prov. 16:7); Acts 7:10; 27:3">⚓</a>God had brought Daniel into the favor and goodwill of the chief of the eunuchs. </span>
<span class="verse da_1_10"><sup>10</sup>And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and drink. For why should he see your faces looking worse than the young men who <i>are</i> your age? Then you would endanger my head before the king.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_1_11"> <sup>11</sup>So Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, </span>
<span class="verse da_1_12"><sup>12</sup>“Please test your servants for ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink. </span>
<span class="verse da_1_13"><sup>13</sup>Then let our appearance be examined before you, and the appearance of the young men who eat the portion of the king’s delicacies; and as you see fit, <i>so</i> deal with your servants.” </span>
<span class="verse da_1_14"><sup>14</sup>So he consented with them in this matter, and tested them ten days.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_1_15"> <sup>15</sup>And at the end of ten days their features appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the young men who ate the portion of the king’s delicacies. </span>
<span class="verse da_1_16"><sup>16</sup>Thus the steward took away their portion of delicacies and the wine that they were to drink, and gave them vegetables.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_1_17"> <sup>17</sup>As for these four young men, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:12, 28; 2 Chr. 1:10–12; (Luke 21:15; James 1:5–7)">⚓</a>God gave them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:22">⚓</a>knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom; and Daniel had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:6; 2 Chr. 26:5; Dan. 5:11, 12, 14; 10:1">⚓</a>understanding in all visions and dreams.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_1_18"> <sup>18</sup>Now at the end of the days, when the king had said that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. </span>
<span class="verse da_1_19"><sup>19</sup>Then the king interviewed them, and among them all none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:46; (Prov. 22:29); Dan. 1:5">⚓</a>they served before the king. </span>
<span class="verse da_1_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 10:1">⚓</a>And in all matters of wisdom <i>and</i> understanding about which the king examined them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians <i>and</i> astrologers who <i>were</i> in all his realm. </span>
<span class="verse da_1_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 6:28; 10:1">⚓</a>Thus Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus.<br/></span>
