<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:5–8; 41:1, 8; Job33:15–17; Dan. 2:3; 4:5">⚓</a>and his spirit was <i>so</i> troubled that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 6:1; Dan. 6:18">⚓</a>his sleep left him. </span>
<span class="verse da_2_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:8; Ex. 7:11; Is. 47:12, 13; Dan. 1:20; 2:10, 27; 4:6; 5:7">⚓</a>Then the king gave the command to call the magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. </span>
<span class="verse da_2_3"><sup>3</sup>And the king said to them, “I have had a dream, and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:31; Dan. 3:9; 5:10; 6:6, 21">⚓</a>“O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, “My decision is firm: if you do not make known the dream to me, and its interpretation, you shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 10:27; Ezra 6:11; Dan. 3:29">⚓</a>cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made an ash heap. </span>
<span class="verse da_2_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 5:16">⚓</a>However, if you tell the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_7"> <sup>7</sup>They answered again and said, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will give its interpretation.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_8"> <sup>8</sup>The king answered and said, “I know for certain that you would gain time, because you see that my decision is firm: </span>
<span class="verse da_2_9"><sup>9</sup>if you do not make known the dream to me, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> <i>only</i> one decree for you! For you have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the time has changed. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_10"> <sup>10</sup>The Chaldeans answered the king, and said, “There is not a man on earth who can tell the king’s matter; therefore no king, lord, or ruler has <i>ever</i> asked such things of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean. </span>
<span class="verse da_2_11"><sup>11</sup><i>It</i> <i>is</i> a difficult thing that the king requests, and there is no other who can tell it to the king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:39; Dan. 5:11">⚓</a>except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_12"> <sup>12</sup>For this reason the king was angry and very furious, and gave the command to destroy all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. </span>
<span class="verse da_2_13"><sup>13</sup>So the decree went out, and they began killing the wise <i>men;</i> and they sought <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 1:19, 20">⚓</a>Daniel and his companions, to kill <i>them.</i><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>God Reveals Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_2_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then with counsel and wisdom Daniel answered Arioch, the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon; </span>
<span class="verse da_2_15"><sup>15</sup>he answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, “Why is the decree from the king so urgent?” Then Arioch made the decision known to Daniel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_16"> <sup>16</sup>So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him time, that he might tell the king the interpretation. </span>
<span class="verse da_2_17"><sup>17</sup>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the decision known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, </span>
<span class="verse da_2_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 9:9; Matt. 18:19)">⚓</a>that they might seek mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret, so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the rest of the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. </span>
<span class="verse da_2_19"><sup>19</sup>Then the secret was revealed to Daniel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:6; Job 33:15; (Prov. 3:32); Amos 3:7">⚓</a>in a night vision. So Daniel blessed the God of heaven.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_20"> <sup>20</sup>Daniel answered and said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 113:2">⚓</a>“Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Chr. 29:11, 12; Job 12:13; Ps. 147:5; Jer. 32:19; Matt. 6:13; Rom. 11:33)">⚓</a>For wisdom and might are His.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_21">   <sup>21</sup>And He changes <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 31:15; Esth. 1:13; Dan. 2:9; 7:25">⚓</a>the times and the seasons;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 12:18; (Ps. 75:6, 7; Jer. 27:5; Dan. 4:35)">⚓</a>He removes kings and raises up kings;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 3:9, 10; 4:29; (James 1:5)">⚓</a>He gives wisdom to the wise<br/>   And knowledge to those who have understanding.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_22">   <sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 12:22; Ps. 25:14; (Prov. 3:22)">⚓</a>He reveals deep and secret things;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 26:6; Ps. 139:12; (Is. 45:7; Jer. 23:24; Heb. 4:13)">⚓</a>He knows what <i>is</i> in the darkness,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 36:9); Dan. 5:11, 14; (1 Tim. 6:16; James 1:17; 1 John 1:5)">⚓</a>light dwells with Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_23">  <sup>23</sup>“I thank You and praise You,<br/>   O God of my fathers;<br/>   You have given me wisdom and might,<br/>   And have now made known to me what we <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 21:2, 4; Dan. 2:18, 29, 30">⚓</a>asked of You,<br/>   For You have made known to us the king’s demand.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Daniel Explains the Dream</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_2_24"> <sup>24</sup>Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon. He went and said thus to him: “Do not destroy the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon; take me before the king, and I will tell the king the interpretation.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king, and said thus to him, “I have found a man of the captives of Judah, who will make known to the king the interpretation.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_26"> <sup>26</sup>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name <i>was</i> Belteshazzar, “Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_27"> <sup>27</sup>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, “The secret which the king has demanded, the wise <i>men,</i> the astrologers, the magicians, and the soothsayers cannot declare to the king. </span>
<span class="verse da_2_28"><sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:8; Amos 4:13">⚓</a>But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:1; Is. 2:2; Dan. 10:14; Mic. 4:1">⚓</a>what will be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head upon your bed, were these: </span>
<span class="verse da_2_29"><sup>29</sup>As for you, O king, thoughts came <i>to</i> your <i>mind</i> <i>while</i> on your bed, <i>about</i> what would come to pass after this; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 2:22, 28)">⚓</a>and He who reveals secrets has made known to you what will be. </span>
<span class="verse da_2_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:12">⚓</a>But as for me, this secret has not been revealed to me because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but for <i>our</i> sakes who make known the interpretation to the king, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:47">⚓</a>and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_31"> <sup>31</sup>“You, O king, were watching; and behold, a great image! This great image, whose splendor <i>was</i> excellent, stood before you; and its form <i>was</i> awesome. </span>
<span class="verse da_2_32"><sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:38, 45">⚓</a>This image’s head <i>was</i> of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, </span>
<span class="verse da_2_33"><sup>33</sup>its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. </span>
<span class="verse da_2_34"><sup>34</sup>You watched while a stone was cut out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 8:25; (Zech. 4:6); 2 Cor. 5:1; Heb. 9:24">⚓</a>without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. </span>
<span class="verse da_2_35"><sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:23–27; (Rev. 16:14)">⚓</a>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 1:4; Is. 17:13; 41:15, 16; Hos. 13:3">⚓</a>like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 37:10, 36">⚓</a>no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 2:2, 3); Mic. 4:1">⚓</a>became a great mountain <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 80:9">⚓</a>and filled the whole earth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_2_36"> <sup>36</sup>“This <i>is</i> the dream. Now we will tell the interpretation of it before the king. </span>

<span class="verse da_2_41"><sup>41</sup>Whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay. </span>

<span class="verse da_2_43"><sup>43</sup>As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay. </span>
<span class="verse da_2_44"><sup>44</sup>And in the days of these kings <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:28, 37">⚓</a>the God of heaven will set up a kingdom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 9:6, 7; Ezek. 37:25; Dan. 4:3, 34; 6:26; 7:14, 27; Mic. 4:7; (Luke 1:32, 33)">⚓</a>which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:9; Is. 60:12; Dan. 2:34, 35; (1 Cor. 15:24)">⚓</a>it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever. </span>
