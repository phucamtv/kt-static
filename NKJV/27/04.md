<span class="verse da_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Nebuchadnezzar the king,<br/> <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 4:17; Dan. 3:4; 6:25">⚓</a>To all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth:<br/> Peace be multiplied to you.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_4_2"> <sup>2</sup>I thought it good to declare the signs and wonders <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 3:26">⚓</a>that the Most High God has worked for me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_4_3">  <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:16; Ps. 89:35–37; Dan. 6:27; 7:13, 14; (Luke 1:31–33)">⚓</a>How great <i>are</i> His signs,<br/>   And how mighty His wonders!<br/>   His kingdom <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 2:44; 4:34; 6:26)">⚓</a>an everlasting kingdom,<br/>   And His dominion <i>is</i> from generation to generation.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_4_4"> <sup>4</sup>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace. </span>
<span class="verse da_4_5"><sup>5</sup>I saw a dream which made me afraid, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:28, 29">⚓</a>and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:1">⚓</a>troubled me. </span>
<span class="verse da_4_6"><sup>6</sup>Therefore I issued a decree to bring in all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. </span>
<span class="verse da_4_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:2">⚓</a>Then the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came in, and I told them the dream; but they did not make known to me its interpretation. </span>
<span class="verse da_4_8"><sup>8</sup>But at last Daniel came before me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 1:7">⚓</a>(his name <i>is</i> Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 63:11; Dan. 2:11; 4:18; 5:11, 14">⚓</a>in him <i>is</i> the Spirit of the Holy God), and I told the dream before him, <i>saying:</i></span>
<span class="verse da_4_9"><sup>9</sup>“Belteshazzar, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:48; 5:11">⚓</a>chief of the magicians, because I know that the Spirit of the Holy God <i>is</i> in you, and no secret troubles you, explain to me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_4_10"> <sup>10</sup>“These <i>were</i> the visions of my head <i>while</i> on my bed:<br/>  I was looking, and behold,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 31:3; Dan. 4:20">⚓</a>A tree in the midst of the earth,<br/>   And its height was great.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_4_11">   <sup>11</sup>The tree grew and became strong;<br/>   Its height reached to the heavens,<br/>   And it could be seen to the ends of all the earth.<br/></span>

<span class="verse da_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>“I saw in the visions of my head <i>while</i> on my bed, and there was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 4:17, 23)">⚓</a>a watcher, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:2; Ps. 89:7; Dan. 8:13; Zech. 14:5; Jude 14">⚓</a>a holy one, coming down from heaven. </span>
<span class="verse da_4_14"><sup>14</sup>He cried aloud and said thus:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 31:10–14; Dan. 4:23; (Matt. 3:10; 7:19; Luke 13:7–9)">⚓</a>‘Chop down the tree and cut off its branches,<br/>   Strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit.<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 31:12, 13; Dan. 4:12">⚓</a>Let the beasts get out from under it,<br/>   And the birds from its branches.<br/></span>

<span class="verse da_4_16">   <sup>16</sup>Let his heart be changed from <i>that</i> <i>of</i> a man,<br/>   Let him be given the heart of a beast,<br/>   And let seven <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 11:13; 12:7">⚓</a>times pass over him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_4_17">  <sup>17</sup>‘This decision <i>is</i> by the decree of the watchers,<br/>   And the sentence by the word of the holy ones,<br/>   In order <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 9:16; 83:18">⚓</a>that the living may know<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:21; 4:25, 32; 5:21">⚓</a>That the Most High rules in the kingdom of men,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 27:5–7; Ezek. 29:18–20; Dan. 2:37; 5:18">⚓</a>Gives it to whomever He will,<br/>   And sets over it the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:8; Dan. 11:21">⚓</a>lowest of men.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_4_18"> <sup>18</sup>“This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 41:8, 15; Dan. 5:8, 15">⚓</a>since all the wise <i>men</i> of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation; but you <i>are</i> able, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 4:8, 9; 5:11, 14">⚓</a>for the Spirit of the Holy God <i>is</i> in you.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Daniel Explains the Second Dream</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_4_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then Daniel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 4:8">⚓</a>whose name <i>was</i> Belteshazzar, was astonished for a time, and his thoughts <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 4:19; Dan. 7:15, 28; 8:27">⚓</a>troubled him. <i>So</i> the king spoke, and said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble you.” Belteshazzar answered and said, “My lord, <i>may</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 18:32; Jer. 29:7; Dan. 4:24; 10:16">⚓</a>the dream concern those who hate you, and its interpretation concern your enemies!<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_4_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 4:10–12">⚓</a>“The tree that you saw, which grew and became strong, whose height reached to the heavens and which <i>could</i> <i>be</i> seen by all the earth, </span>
<span class="verse da_4_21"><sup>21</sup>whose leaves <i>were</i> lovely and its fruit abundant, in which <i>was</i> food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and in whose branches the birds of the heaven had their home— </span>
<span class="verse da_4_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:37, 38">⚓</a>it <i>is</i> you, O king, who have grown and become strong; for your greatness has grown and reaches to the heavens, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 27:6–8">⚓</a>and your dominion to the end of the earth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_4_23"> <sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 4:13–15">⚓</a>“And inasmuch as the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Chop down the tree and destroy it, but leave its stump and roots in the earth, <i>bound</i> with a band of iron and bronze in the tender grass of the field; let it be wet with the dew of heaven, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 5:21">⚓</a>and let him graze with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him’; </span>
<span class="verse da_4_24"><sup>24</sup>this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king: </span>

<span class="verse da_4_26"> <sup>26</sup>“And inasmuch as they gave the command to leave the stump <i>and</i> roots of the tree, your kingdom shall be assured to you, after you come to know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:25; Luke 15:18">⚓</a>Heaven rules. </span>
<span class="verse da_4_27"><sup>27</sup>Therefore, O king, let my advice be acceptable to you; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 28:13); Is. 55:7; Ezek. 18:21, 22; (Rom. 2:9–11; 1 Pet. 4:8)">⚓</a>break off your sins by <i>being</i> righteous, and your iniquities by showing mercy to <i>the</i> poor. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 41:1–3); Is. 58:6, 7, 10">⚓</a>Perhaps there may be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:29">⚓</a>a lengthening of your prosperity.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Nebuchadnezzar’s Humiliation</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_4_28"> <sup>28</sup>All <i>this</i> came upon King Nebuchadnezzar. </span>
<span class="verse da_4_29"><sup>29</sup>At the end of the twelve months he was walking about the royal palace of Babylon. </span>
<span class="verse da_4_30"><sup>30</sup>The king <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 16:18; Is. 13:19; Dan. 5:20">⚓</a>spoke, saying, “Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for a royal dwelling by my mighty power and for the honor of my majesty?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_4_31"> <sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 5:5; Luke 12:20">⚓</a>While the word <i>was</i> <i>still</i> in the king’s mouth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 4:24">⚓</a>a voice fell from heaven: “King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: the kingdom has departed from you! </span>
<span class="verse da_4_32"><sup>32</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 4:25)">⚓</a>they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> with the beasts of the field.

<span class="verse da_4_33"> <sup>33</sup>That very hour the word was fulfilled concerning Nebuchadnezzar; he was driven from men and ate grass like oxen; his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair had grown like eagles’ <i>feathers</i> and his nails like birds’ <i>claws.</i><br/></span>
