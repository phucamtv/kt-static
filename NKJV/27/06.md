<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>The Plot Against Daniel</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred and twenty satraps, to be over the whole kingdom; </span>
<span class="verse da_6_2"><sup>2</sup>and over these, three governors, of whom Daniel <i>was</i> one, that the satraps might give account to them, so that the king would suffer no loss. </span>
<span class="verse da_6_3"><sup>3</sup>Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the governors and satraps, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 5:12">⚓</a>because an excellent spirit <i>was</i> in him; and the king gave thought to setting him over the whole realm. </span>
<span class="verse da_6_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 4:4">⚓</a>So the governors and satraps sought to find <i>some</i> charge against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find no charge or fault, because he <i>was</i> faithful; nor was there any error or fault found in him. </span>
<span class="verse da_6_5"><sup>5</sup>Then these men said, “We shall not find any charge against this Daniel unless we find <i>it</i> against him concerning the law of his God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_6_6"> <sup>6</sup>So these governors and satraps thronged before the king, and said thus to him: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 2:3; Dan. 2:4; 6:21">⚓</a>“King Darius, live forever! </span>
<span class="verse da_6_7"><sup>7</sup>All the governors of the kingdom, the administrators and satraps, the counselors and advisors, have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 59:3; 62:4; 64:2–6">⚓</a>consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree, that whoever petitions any god or man for thirty days, except you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions. </span>
<span class="verse da_6_8"><sup>8</sup>Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the writing, so that it cannot be changed, according to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 1:19; 8:8; Dan. 6:12, 15">⚓</a>law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter.” </span>
<span class="verse da_6_9"><sup>9</sup>Therefore King Darius signed the written decree.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Daniel in the Lions’ Den</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_6_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went home. And in his upper room, with his windows open <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:29, 30, 46–48; Ps. 5:7; Jon. 2:4">⚓</a>toward Jerusalem, he knelt down on his knees <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 55:17; Acts 2:1, 2, 15; (Phil. 4:6); 1 Thess. 5:17, 18">⚓</a>three times that day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as was his custom since early days.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_6_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God. </span>
<span class="verse da_6_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 3:8–12; Acts 16:19–21">⚓</a>And they went before the king, and spoke concerning the king’s decree: “Have you not signed a decree that every man who petitions any god or man within thirty days, except you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?”<br/> The king answered and said, “The thing <i>is</i> true, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 1:19; Dan. 6:8, 15">⚓</a>according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which does not alter.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_6_13"> <sup>13</sup>So they answered and said before the king, “That Daniel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 1:6; 5:13">⚓</a>who is one of the captives from Judah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 3:8; Dan. 3:12; Acts 5:29">⚓</a>does not show due regard for you, O king, or for the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_6_14"> <sup>14</sup>And the king, when he heard <i>these</i> words, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:26">⚓</a>was greatly displeased with himself, and set <i>his</i> heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him. </span>
<span class="verse da_6_15"><sup>15</sup>Then these men approached the king, and said to the king, “Know, O king, that <i>it</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 8:8; Ps. 94:20, 21; Dan. 6:8, 12">⚓</a>the law of the Medes and Persians that no decree or statute which the king establishes may be changed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_6_16"> <sup>16</sup>So the king gave the command, and they brought Daniel and cast <i>him</i> into the den of lions. <i>But</i> the king spoke, saying to Daniel, “Your God, whom you serve continually, He will deliver you.” </span>
<span class="verse da_6_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lam. 3:53">⚓</a>Then a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:66">⚓</a>and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signets of his lords, that the purpose concerning Daniel might not be changed.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Daniel Saved from the Lions</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_6_18"> <sup>18</sup>Now the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; and no musicians were brought before him. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 6:1; Ps. 77:4; Dan. 2:1">⚓</a>Also his sleep went from him. </span>
<span class="verse da_6_19"><sup>19</sup>Then the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 3:24">⚓</a>king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions. </span>
<span class="verse da_6_20"><sup>20</sup>And when he came to the den, he cried out with a lamenting voice to Daniel. The king spoke, saying to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:14; Num. 11:23; Jer. 32:17; Dan. 3:17; (Luke 1:37)">⚓</a>has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_6_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Daniel said to the king, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:4; 6:6">⚓</a>“O king, live forever! </span>
<span class="verse da_6_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 20:16; Is. 63:9; Dan. 3:28; Acts 12:11; (Heb. 1:14)">⚓</a>My God sent His angel and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 91:11–13; 2 Tim. 4:17; Heb. 11:33">⚓</a>shut the lions’ mouths, so that they have not hurt me, because I was found innocent before Him; and also, O king, I have done no wrong before you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_6_23"> <sup>23</sup>Now the king was exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no injury whatever was found on him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 11:33">⚓</a>because he believed in his God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Darius Honors God</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_6_24"> <sup>24</sup>And the king gave the command, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 19:18, 19; Esth. 7:10">⚓</a>and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast <i>them</i> into the den of lions—them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 24:16; 2 Kin. 14:6; Esth. 9:10">⚓</a>their children, and their wives; and the lions overpowered them, and broke all their bones in pieces before they ever came to the bottom of the den.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_6_25"> <sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 1:1, 2; Esth. 3:12; 8:9; Dan. 4:1">⚓</a>Then King Darius wrote:<br/> To all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth:<br/> Peace be multiplied to you.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_6_26"> <sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 6:8–12; 7:13; Dan. 3:29">⚓</a>I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom <i>men</i> <i>must</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 99:1">⚓</a>tremble and fear before the God of Daniel.<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 4:34; 6:20; Hos. 1:10; Rom. 9:26">⚓</a>For He <i>is</i> the living God,<br/>   And steadfast forever;<br/>   His kingdom <i>is</i> <i>the</i> <i>one</i> which shall not be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:44; 4:3; 7:14, 27; (Luke 1:33)">⚓</a>destroyed,<br/>   And His dominion <i>shall</i> <i>endure</i> to the end.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_6_27">   <sup>27</sup>He delivers and rescues,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 4:2, 3">⚓</a>And He works signs and wonders<br/>   In heaven and on earth,<br/>   Who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_6_28"> <sup>28</sup>So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 1:21">⚓</a>and in the reign of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 1:1, 2">⚓</a>Cyrus the Persian.<br/></span>
