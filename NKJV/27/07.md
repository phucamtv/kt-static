<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>Vision of the Four Beasts</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 12:6; (Amos 3:7)">⚓</a>Daniel had a dream and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 2:28)">⚓</a>visions of his head <i>while</i> on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream, telling the main facts.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_7_2"> <sup>2</sup>Daniel spoke, saying, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the Great Sea. </span>
<span class="verse da_7_3"><sup>3</sup>And four great beasts <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:17; Rev. 13:1; 17:8">⚓</a>came up from the sea, each different from the other. </span>
<span class="verse da_7_4"><sup>4</sup>The first <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 28:49; 2 Sam. 1:23; Jer. 48:40; Ezek. 17:3; Hab. 1:8">⚓</a>like a lion, and had eagle’s wings. I watched till its wings were plucked off; and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 4:16, 34">⚓</a>man’s heart was given to it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_7_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:39">⚓</a>“And suddenly another beast, a second, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and <i>had</i> three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And they said thus to it: ‘Arise, devour much flesh!’<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_7_6"> <sup>6</sup>“After this I looked, and there was another, like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird. The beast also had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 8:8, 22">⚓</a>four heads, and dominion was given to it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_7_7"> <sup>7</sup>“After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:40">⚓</a>a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, exceedingly strong. It had huge iron teeth; it was devouring, breaking in pieces, and trampling the residue with its feet. It <i>was</i> different from all the beasts that <i>were</i> before it, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:41; Rev. 12:3; 13:1">⚓</a>and it had ten horns. </span>
<span class="verse da_7_8"><sup>8</sup>I was considering the horns, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 8:9">⚓</a>there was another horn, a little one, coming up among them, before whom three of the first horns were plucked out by the roots. And there, in this horn, <i>were</i> eyes like the eyes <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 9:7">⚓</a>of a man, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 12:3; Rev. 13:5, 6">⚓</a>and a mouth speaking pompous words.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Vision of the Ancient of Days</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_7_9">  <sup>9</sup>“I<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rev. 20:4)">⚓</a> watched till thrones were put in place,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 90:2">⚓</a>the Ancient of Days was seated;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 104:2; Rev. 1:14">⚓</a>His garment <i>was</i> white as snow,<br/>   And the hair of His head <i>was</i> like pure wool.<br/>   His throne <i>was</i> a fiery flame,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:15">⚓</a>Its wheels a burning fire;<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_7_10">   <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 50:3; Is. 30:33; 66:15">⚓</a>A fiery stream issued<br/>   And came forth from before Him.<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:2; 1 Kin. 22:19; Ps. 68:17; Rev. 5:11">⚓</a>A thousand thousands ministered to Him;<br/>   Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him.<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 12:1; (Rev. 20:11–15)">⚓</a>The court was seated,<br/>   And the books were opened.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_7_11"> <sup>11</sup>“I watched then because of the sound of the pompous words which the horn was speaking; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rev. 19:20; 20:10)">⚓</a>I watched till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed and given to the burning flame. </span>
<span class="verse da_7_12"><sup>12</sup>As for the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.<br/></span>

<div class="title"><h3>Daniel’s Visions Interpreted</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_7_15"> <sup>15</sup>“I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit within <i>my</i> body, and the visions of my head troubled me. </span>
<span class="verse da_7_16"><sup>16</sup>I came near to one of those who stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of these things: </span>
<span class="verse da_7_17"><sup>17</sup>‘Those great beasts, which are four, <i>are</i> four kings <i>which</i> arise out of the earth. </span>
<span class="verse da_7_18"><sup>18</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 149:5–9; Is. 60:12–14; Dan. 7:14; (2 Tim. 2:11; Rev. 2:26, 27; 20:4; 22:5)">⚓</a>the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_7_19"> <sup>19</sup>“Then I wished to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the others, exceedingly dreadful, <i>with</i> its teeth of iron and its nails of bronze, <i>which</i> devoured, broke in pieces, and trampled the residue with its feet; </span>
<span class="verse da_7_20"><sup>20</sup>and the ten horns that <i>were</i> on its head, and the other <i>horn</i> which came up, before which three fell, namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth which spoke pompous words, whose appearance <i>was</i> greater than his fellows.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_7_21"> <sup>21</sup>“I was watching; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 11:7; 13:7; 17:14">⚓</a>and the same horn was making war against the saints, and prevailing against them, </span>
<span class="verse da_7_22"><sup>22</sup>until the Ancient of Days came, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rev. 1:6)">⚓</a>and a judgment was made <i>in</i> <i>favor</i> of the saints of the Most High, and the time came for the saints to possess the kingdom.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_7_23"> <sup>23</sup>“Thus he said:<br/>  ‘The fourth beast shall be<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:40">⚓</a>A fourth kingdom on earth,<br/>   Which shall be different from all <i>other</i> kingdoms,<br/>   And shall devour the whole earth,<br/>   Trample it and break it in pieces.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_7_24">   <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:7; Rev. 13:1; 17:12">⚓</a>The ten horns <i>are</i> ten kings<br/>   <i>Who</i> shall arise from this kingdom.<br/>   And another shall rise after them;<br/>   He shall be different from the first <i>ones,</i><br/>   And shall subdue three kings.<br/></span>

<span class="verse da_7_27">   <sup>27</sup>Then the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 54:3; Dan. 7:14, 18, 22; Rev. 20:4">⚓</a>kingdom and dominion,<br/>   And the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven,<br/>   Shall be given to the people, the saints of the Most High.<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:16; Ps. 89:35–37; Is. 9:7; Dan. 2:44; 4:34; 7:14; (Luke 1:33, 34); John 12:34; (Rev. 11:15; 22:5)">⚓</a>His kingdom <i>is</i> an everlasting kingdom,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:6–12; 22:27; 72:11; 86:9; Is. 60:12; Rev. 11:1">⚓</a>And all dominions shall serve and obey Him.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_7_28"> <sup>28</sup>“This <i>is</i> the end of the account. As for me, Daniel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 8:27">⚓</a>my thoughts greatly troubled me, and my countenance changed; but I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:19, 51">⚓</a>kept the matter in my heart.”<br/></span>
