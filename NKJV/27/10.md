<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>Vision of the Glorious Man</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel, whose <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 1:7">⚓</a>name was called Belteshazzar. The message <i>was</i> true, but the appointed time <i>was</i> long; and he understood the message, and had understanding of the vision. </span>
<span class="verse da_10_2"><sup>2</sup>In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks. </span>
<span class="verse da_10_3"><sup>3</sup>I ate no pleasant food, no meat or wine came into my mouth, nor did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_10_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now on the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, that <i>is,</i> the Tigris, </span>
<span class="verse da_10_5"><sup>5</sup>I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a certain man clothed in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 9:2; 10:2">⚓</a>linen, whose waist <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 1:13; 15:6">⚓</a>girded with gold of Uphaz! </span>
<span class="verse da_10_6"><sup>6</sup>His body <i>was</i> like beryl, his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like torches of fire, his arms and feet like burnished bronze in color, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rev. 1:15)">⚓</a>and the sound of his words like the voice of a multitude.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_10_7"> <sup>7</sup>And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great terror fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves. </span>
<span class="verse da_10_8"><sup>8</sup>Therefore I was left alone when I saw this great vision, and no strength remained in me; for my vigor was turned to frailty in me, and I retained no strength. </span>
<span class="verse da_10_9"><sup>9</sup>Yet I heard the sound of his words; and while I heard the sound of his words I was in a deep sleep on my face, with my face to the ground.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Prophecies Concerning Persia and Greece</h3></div>
<span class="verse da_10_10"> <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:21">⚓</a>Suddenly, a hand touched me, which made me tremble on my knees and <i>on</i> the palms of my hands. </span>
<span class="verse da_10_11"><sup>11</sup>And he said to me, “O Daniel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:23">⚓</a>man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you.” While he was speaking this word to me, I stood trembling.<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_10_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then he said to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 1:17">⚓</a>“Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:3, 4, 22, 23; Acts 10:4">⚓</a>your words were heard; and I have come because of your words. </span>
<span class="verse da_10_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:20">⚓</a>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; and behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:21; 12:1; Jude 9; (Rev. 12:7)">⚓</a>Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left alone there with the kings of Persia. </span>
<span class="verse da_10_14"><sup>14</sup>Now I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:1; Deut. 31:29; Dan. 2:28">⚓</a>in the latter days, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 8:26; 10:1">⚓</a>for the vision <i>refers</i> to <i>many</i> days yet <i>to</i> <i>come.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_10_15"> <sup>15</sup>When he had spoken such words to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 8:18; 10:9">⚓</a>I turned my face toward the ground and became speechless. </span>
<span class="verse da_10_16"><sup>16</sup>And suddenly, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 8:15">⚓</a><i>one</i> having the likeness of the sons of men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:9; Dan. 10:10">⚓</a>touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke, saying to him who stood before me, “My lord, because of the vision <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:8, 9">⚓</a>my sorrows have overwhelmed me, and I have retained no strength. </span>
<span class="verse da_10_17"><sup>17</sup>For how can this servant of my lord talk with you, my lord? As for me, no strength remains in me now, nor is any breath left in me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_10_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then again, <i>the</i> <i>one</i> having the likeness of a man touched me and strengthened me. </span>
<span class="verse da_10_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:11">⚓</a>And he said, “O man greatly beloved, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:23; Is. 43:1; Dan. 10:12">⚓</a>fear not! Peace <i>be</i> to you; be strong, yes, be strong!”<br/> So when he spoke to me I was strengthened, and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse da_10_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then he said, “Do you know why I have come to you? And now I must return to fight <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:13">⚓</a>with the prince of Persia; and when I have gone forth, indeed the prince of Greece will come. </span>
<span class="verse da_10_21"><sup>21</sup>But I will tell you what is noted in the Scripture of Truth. (No one upholds me against these, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:13; Jude 9; (Rev. 12:7)">⚓</a>except Michael your prince.<br/></span>
