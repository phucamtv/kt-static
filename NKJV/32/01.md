<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>Jonah’s Disobedience</h3></div>
<span class="verse gion_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the word of the Lord came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 14:25; Matt. 12:39–41; 16:4; Luke 11:29, 30, 32">⚓</a>Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gion_1_2"><sup>2</sup>“Arise, go to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 37:37">⚓</a>Nineveh, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 10:11, 12; 2 Kin. 19:36; Jon. 4:11; Nah. 1:1; Zeph. 2:13">⚓</a>great city, and cry out against it; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:20; Hos. 7:2">⚓</a>their wickedness has come up before Me.” </span>
<span class="verse gion_1_3"><sup>3</sup>But Jonah arose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. He went down to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:46; 2 Chr. 2:16; Ezra 3:7; Acts 9:36, 43">⚓</a>Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare, and went down into it, to go with them to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 23:1">⚓</a>Tarshish <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:16; Job 1:12; 2:7">⚓</a>from the presence of the Lord.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Storm at Sea</h3></div>
<span class="verse gion_1_4"> <sup>4</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 107:25">⚓</a>the Lord sent out a great wind on the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was about to be broken up.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_1_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the mariners were afraid; and every man cried out to his god, and threw the cargo that <i>was</i> in the ship into the sea, to lighten the load. But Jonah had gone down <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 24:3">⚓</a>into the lowest parts of the ship, had lain down, and was fast asleep.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_1_6"> <sup>6</sup>So the captain came to him, and said to him, “What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 107:28">⚓</a>call on your God; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Joel 2:14">⚓</a>perhaps your God will consider us, so that we may not perish.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_1_7"> <sup>7</sup>And they said to one another, “Come, let us <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:14; 1 Sam. 14:41, 42; Prov. 16:33">⚓</a>cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this trouble <i>has</i> <i>come</i> upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. </span>
<span class="verse gion_1_8"><sup>8</sup>Then they said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:19; 1 Sam. 14:43">⚓</a>“Please tell us! For whose cause <i>is</i> this trouble upon us? What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_1_9"> <sup>9</sup>So he said to them, “I <i>am</i> a Hebrew; and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Neh. 9:6); Ps. 146:6; Acts 17:24">⚓</a>who made the sea and the dry <i>land.</i>”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jonah Thrown into the Sea</h3></div>
<span class="verse gion_1_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, “Why have you done this?” For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them. </span>
<span class="verse gion_1_11"><sup>11</sup>Then they said to him, “What shall we do to you that the sea may be calm for us?”—for the sea was growing more tempestuous.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_1_12"> <sup>12</sup>And he said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:50">⚓</a>“Pick me up and throw me into the sea; then the sea will become calm for you. For I know that this great tempest <i>is</i> because of me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_1_13"> <sup>13</sup>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to return to land, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 21:30)">⚓</a>but they could not, for the sea continued to grow more tempestuous against them. </span>
<span class="verse gion_1_14"><sup>14</sup>Therefore they cried out to the Lord and said, “We pray, O Lord, please do not let us perish for this man’s life, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 21:8">⚓</a>do not charge us with innocent blood; for You, O Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 115:3; (Dan. 4:35)">⚓</a>have done as it pleased You.” </span>
<span class="verse gion_1_15"><sup>15</sup>So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 89:9; 107:29); Luke 8:24">⚓</a>and the sea ceased from its raging. </span>
<span class="verse gion_1_16"><sup>16</sup>Then the men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 4:41; Acts 5:11">⚓</a>feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the Lord and took vows.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jonah’s Prayer and Deliverance</h3></div>
<span class="verse gion_1_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 12:40; Luke 11:30)">⚓</a>Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.<br/></span>
