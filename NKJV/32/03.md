<span class="verse gion_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time, saying, </span>
<span class="verse gion_3_2"><sup>2</sup>“Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the message that I tell you.” </span>
<span class="verse gion_3_3"><sup>3</sup>So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city, a three-day journey <i>in</i> <i>extent.</i></span>
<span class="verse gion_3_4"><sup>4</sup>And Jonah began to enter the city on the first day’s walk. Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 18:22)">⚓</a>he cried out and said, “Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The People of Nineveh Believe</h3></div>
<span class="verse gion_3_5"> <sup>5</sup>So the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 12:41; Luke 11:32)">⚓</a>people of Nineveh believed God, proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them. </span>
<span class="verse gion_3_6"><sup>6</sup>Then word came to the king of Nineveh; and he arose from his throne and laid aside his robe, covered <i>himself</i> with sackcloth <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 2:8">⚓</a>and sat in ashes. </span>
<span class="verse gion_3_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 20:3; Dan. 3:29; Joel 2:15">⚓</a>And he caused <i>it</i> to be proclaimed and published throughout Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying,<br/>  Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; do not let them eat, or drink water. </span>
<span class="verse gion_3_8">  <sup>8</sup>But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily to God; yes, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 58:6">⚓</a>let every one turn from his evil way and from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 59:6">⚓</a>the violence that is in his hands. </span>
<span class="verse gion_3_9">  <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:22; Joel 2:14; Amos 5:15">⚓</a>Who can tell <i>if</i> God will turn and relent, and turn away from His fierce anger, so that we may not perish?<br/></span>
