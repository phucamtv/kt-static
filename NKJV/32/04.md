<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Jonah’s Anger and God’s Kindness</h3></div>
<span class="verse gion_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he became angry. </span>
<span class="verse gion_4_2"><sup>2</sup>So he prayed to the Lord, and said, “Ah, Lord, was not this what I said when I was still in my country? Therefore I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jon. 1:3">⚓</a>fled previously to Tarshish; for I know that You <i>are</i> a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:6; Num. 14:18; Ps. 86:5, 15; Joel 2:13">⚓</a>gracious and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, One who relents from doing harm. </span>
<span class="verse gion_4_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:4; Job 6:8, 9">⚓</a>Therefore now, O Lord, please take my life from me, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jon. 4:8">⚓</a><i>it</i> <i>is</i> better for me to die than to live!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_4_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then the Lord said, “<i>Is</i> <i>it</i> right for you to be angry?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_4_5"> <sup>5</sup>So Jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city. There he made himself a shelter and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city. </span>
<span class="verse gion_4_6"><sup>6</sup>And the Lord God prepared a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be shade for his head to deliver him from his misery. So Jonah was very grateful for the plant. </span>
<span class="verse gion_4_7"><sup>7</sup>But as morning dawned the next day God prepared a worm, and it <i>so</i> damaged the plant that it withered. </span>
<span class="verse gion_4_8"><sup>8</sup>And it happened, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah’s head, so that he grew faint. Then he wished death for himself, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jon. 4:3">⚓</a>“<i>It</i> <i>is</i> better for me to die than to live.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_4_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then God said to Jonah, “<i>Is</i> <i>it</i> right for you to be angry about the plant?”<br/> And he said, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> right for me to be angry, even to death!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gion_4_10"> <sup>10</sup>But the Lord said, “You have had pity on the plant for which you have not labored, nor made it grow, which came up in a night and perished in a night. </span>
<span class="verse gion_4_11"><sup>11</sup>And should I not pity Nineveh, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jon. 1:2; 3:2, 3">⚓</a>that great city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:39; Is. 7:16">⚓</a>who cannot discern between their right hand and their left—and much livestock?”<br/></span>
