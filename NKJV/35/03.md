<span class="verse ha_3_2">  <sup>2</sup>O Lord, I have heard Your speech <i>and</i> was afraid;<br/>   O Lord, revive Your work in the midst of the years!<br/>   In the midst of the years make <i>it</i> known;<br/>   In wrath remember mercy.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_3">  <sup>3</sup>God came from Teman,<br/>   The Holy One from Mount Paran.<br/> <i>Selah</i><br/>  His glory covered the heavens,<br/>   And the earth was full of His praise.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_4">   <sup>4</sup><i>His</i> brightness was like the light;<br/>   He had rays <i>flashing</i> from His hand,<br/>   And there His power <i>was</i> hidden.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_5">   <sup>5</sup>Before Him went pestilence,<br/>   And fever followed at His feet.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_6">  <sup>6</sup>He stood and measured the earth;<br/>   He looked and startled the nations.<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Nah. 1:5">⚓</a>And the everlasting mountains were scattered,<br/>   The perpetual hills bowed.<br/>   His ways <i>are</i> everlasting.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_7">   <sup>7</sup>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;<br/>   The curtains of the land of Midian trembled.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_8">  <sup>8</sup>O Lord, were <i>You</i> displeased with the rivers,<br/>   <i>Was</i> Your anger against the rivers,<br/>   <i>Was</i> Your wrath against the sea,<br/>   That You rode on Your horses,<br/>   Your chariots of salvation?<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_9">   <sup>9</sup>Your bow was made quite ready;<br/>   Oaths were sworn over <i>Your</i> arrows.<br/> <i>Selah</i><br/>  You divided the earth with rivers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_10">   <sup>10</sup>The mountains saw You <i>and</i> trembled;<br/>   The overflowing of the water passed by.<br/>   The deep uttered its voice,<br/>   <i>And</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:22">⚓</a>lifted its hands on high.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_11">   <sup>11</sup>The <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 10:12–14">⚓</a>sun and moon stood still in their habitation;<br/>   At the light of Your arrows they went,<br/>   At the shining of Your glittering spear.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_12">   <sup>12</sup>You marched through the land in indignation;<br/>   You trampled the nations in anger.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_13">   <sup>13</sup>You went forth for the salvation of Your people,<br/>   For salvation with Your Anointed.<br/>   You struck the head from the house of the wicked,<br/>   By laying bare from foundation to neck.<br/> <i>Selah</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_14">  <sup>14</sup>You thrust through with his own arrows<br/>   The head of his villages.<br/>   They came out like a whirlwind to scatter me;<br/>   Their rejoicing was like feasting on the poor in secret.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_15">   <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 77:19; Hab. 3:8">⚓</a>You walked through the sea with Your horses,<br/>   Through the heap of great waters.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_16">  <sup>16</sup>When I heard, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 119:120">⚓</a>my body trembled;<br/>   My lips quivered at <i>the</i> voice;<br/>   Rottenness entered my bones;<br/>   And I trembled in myself,<br/>   That I might rest in the day of trouble.<br/>   When he comes up to the people,<br/>   He will invade them with his troops.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Hymn of Faith</h3></div>
<span class="verse ha_3_17">  <sup>17</sup>Though the fig tree may not blossom,<br/>   Nor fruit be on the vines;<br/>   Though the labor of the olive may fail,<br/>   And the fields yield no food;<br/>   Though the flock may be cut off from the fold,<br/>   And there be no herd in the stalls—<br/></span>
<span class="verse ha_3_18">   <sup>18</sup>Yet I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 41:16; 61:10">⚓</a>rejoice in the Lord,<br/>   I will joy in the God of my salvation.<br/></span>

With my stringed instruments.<br/></span>
