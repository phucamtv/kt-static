<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Vision of the Flying Scroll</h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then I turned and raised my eyes, and saw there a flying <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 36:2; Ezek. 2:9; Rev. 5:1">⚓</a>scroll.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_5_2"> <sup>2</sup>And he said to me, “What do you see?”<br/> So I answered, “I see a flying scroll. Its length <i>is</i> twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_5_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then he said to me, “This <i>is</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 4:6">⚓</a>curse that goes out over the face of the whole earth: ‘Every thief shall be expelled,’ according <i>to</i> this side of <i>the</i> <i>scroll;</i> and, ‘Every perjurer shall be expelled,’ according <i>to</i> that side of it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_5_4">  <sup>4</sup>“I will send out <i>the</i> <i>curse,</i>” says the Lord of hosts;<br/>   “It shall enter the house of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:15; Lev. 19:11">⚓</a>thief<br/>   And the house of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:7; Lev. 19:12; Is. 48:1; Jer. 5:2; Zech. 8:17; Mal. 3:5">⚓</a>the one who swears falsely by My name.<br/>   It shall remain in the midst of his house<br/>   And consume <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 14:34, 35; Job 18:15">⚓</a>it, with its timber and stones.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Vision of the Woman in a Basket</h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_5_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the angel who talked with me came out and said to me, “Lift your eyes now, and see what this <i>is</i> that goes forth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_5_6"> <sup>6</sup>So I asked, “What <i>is</i> it?” And he said, “It <i>is</i> a basket that is going forth.”<br/> He also said, “This <i>is</i> their resemblance throughout the earth: </span>
<span class="verse xa_5_7"><sup>7</sup>Here <i>is</i> a lead disc lifted up, and this <i>is</i> a woman sitting inside the basket”; </span>
<span class="verse xa_5_8"><sup>8</sup>then he said, “This <i>is</i> Wickedness!” And he thrust her down into the basket, and threw the lead cover over its mouth. </span>
<span class="verse xa_5_9"><sup>9</sup>Then I raised my eyes and looked, and there <i>were</i> two women, coming with the wind in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:13, 19; Ps. 104:17; Jer. 8:7">⚓</a>stork, and they lifted up the basket between earth and heaven.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_5_10"> <sup>10</sup>So I said to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 5:5">⚓</a>angel who talked with me, “Where are they carrying the basket?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_5_11"> <sup>11</sup>And he said to me, “To <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 29:5, 28">⚓</a>build a house for it in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 10:10; Is. 11:11; Dan. 1:2">⚓</a>the land of Shinar; when it is ready, <i>the</i> <i>basket</i> will be set there on its base.”<br/></span>
