<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Vision of the Four Chariots</h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then I turned and raised my eyes and looked, and behold, four chariots <i>were</i> coming from between two mountains, and the mountains <i>were</i> mountains of bronze. </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_2"><sup>2</sup>With the first chariot <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 1:8; Rev. 6:4">⚓</a>red horses, with the second chariot <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 6:5">⚓</a>black horses, </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_3"><sup>3</sup>with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot dappled horses—strong <i>steeds.</i></span>
<span class="verse xa_6_4"><sup>4</sup>Then I answered <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 5:10">⚓</a>and said to the angel who talked with me, “What <i>are</i> these, my lord?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_6_5"> <sup>5</sup>And the angel answered and said to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 104:4; Heb. 1:7, 14)">⚓</a>“These <i>are</i> four spirits of heaven, who go out from <i>their</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:19; Dan. 7:10; Zech. 4:14; Luke 1:19">⚓</a>station before the Lord of all the earth. </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_6"><sup>6</sup>The one with the black horses is going to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:14; Ezek. 1:4">⚓</a>the north country, the white are going after them, and the dappled are going toward the south country.” </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_7"><sup>7</sup>Then the strong <i>steeds</i> went out, eager to go, that they might <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 13:17; Zech. 1:10">⚓</a>walk to and fro throughout the earth. And He said, “Go, walk to and fro throughout the earth.” So they walked to and fro throughout the earth. </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_8"><sup>8</sup>And He called to me, and spoke to me, saying, “See, those who go toward the north country have given rest to My <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 10:4">⚓</a>Spirit in the north country.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Command to Crown Joshua</h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_6_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_10"><sup>10</sup>“Receive <i>the</i> <i>gift</i> from the captives—from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have come from Babylon—and go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah. </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_11"><sup>11</sup>Take the silver and gold, make <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:6">⚓</a>an elaborate crown, and set <i>it</i> on the head of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 3:2; Hag. 1:1; Zech. 3:1">⚓</a>Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_12"><sup>12</sup>Then speak to him, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord of hosts, saying:<br/>  “Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:45">⚓</a>the Man whose name <i>is</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 4:2; 11:1; Jer. 23:5; 33:15; Zech. 3:8">⚓</a>BRANCH!<br/>   From His place He shall branch out,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:20; Heb. 3:3)">⚓</a>And He shall build the temple of the Lord;<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_6_13">   <sup>13</sup>Yes, He shall build the temple of the Lord.<br/>   He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 22:24">⚓</a>shall bear the glory,<br/>   And shall sit and rule on His throne;<br/>   So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 110:4; (Heb. 3:1)">⚓</a>He shall be a priest on His throne,<br/>   And the counsel of peace shall be between them both.” ’<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_6_14"> <sup>14</sup>“Now the elaborate crown shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:14; Mark 14:9">⚓</a>for a memorial in the temple of the Lord for Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen the son of Zephaniah. </span>
<span class="verse xa_6_15"><sup>15</sup>Even <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 57:19; (Eph. 2:13)">⚓</a>those from afar shall come and build the temple of the Lord. Then you shall know that the Lord of hosts has sent Me to you. And <i>this</i> shall come to pass if you diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God.”<br/></span>
