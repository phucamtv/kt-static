<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>Obedience Better than Fasting</h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now in the fourth year of King Darius it came to pass <i>that</i> the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, on the fourth <i>day</i> of the ninth month, Chislev, </span>
<span class="verse xa_7_2"><sup>2</sup>when <i>the</i> <i>people</i> sent Sherezer, with Regem-Melech and his men, <i>to</i> the house of God, to pray before the Lord, </span>
<span class="verse xa_7_3"><sup>3</sup><i>and</i> to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:9; Mal. 2:7">⚓</a>ask the priests who <i>were</i> in the house of the Lord of hosts, and the prophets, saying, “Should I weep in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 8:19">⚓</a>the fifth month and fast as I have done for so many years?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_7_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying, </span>
<span class="verse xa_7_5"><sup>5</sup>“Say to all the people of the land, and to the priests: ‘When you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 58:1–9)">⚓</a>fasted and mourned in the fifth <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 41:1">⚓</a>and seventh <i>months</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 1:12">⚓</a>during those seventy years, did you really fast <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 14:6)">⚓</a>for Me—for Me? </span>
<span class="verse xa_7_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:7; 14:26; 1 Chr. 29:22">⚓</a>When you eat and when you drink, do you not eat and drink <i>for</i> <i>yourselves?</i></span>
<span class="verse xa_7_7"><sup>7</sup><i>Should</i> <i>you</i> not <i>have</i> <i>obeyed</i> the words which the Lord proclaimed through the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 1:16–20; Jer. 7:5, 23; Zech. 1:4">⚓</a>former prophets when Jerusalem and the cities around it were inhabited and prosperous, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 17:26">⚓</a>the South and the Lowland were inhabited?’ ”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Disobedience Resulted in Captivity</h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_7_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, saying, </span>
<span class="verse xa_7_9"><sup>9</sup>“Thus says the Lord of hosts:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 58:6, 7; Jer. 7:28">⚓</a>‘Execute true justice,<br/>   Show mercy and compassion<br/>   Everyone to his brother.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_7_10">   <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:22; Ps. 72:4; Is. 1:17; Jer. 5:28">⚓</a>Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless,<br/>   The alien or the poor.<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 36:4; Ezek. 38:10; 45:9; Mic. 2:1; Zech. 8:16, 17">⚓</a>Let none of you plan evil in his heart<br/>   Against his brother.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_7_11"> <sup>11</sup>“But they refused to heed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:29">⚓</a>shrugged their shoulders, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 17:23; Acts 7:57">⚓</a>stopped their ears so that they could not hear. </span>
<span class="verse xa_7_12"><sup>12</sup>Yes, they made their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 11:19">⚓</a>hearts like flint, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:29, 30">⚓</a>refusing to hear the law and the words which the Lord of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:16; Dan. 9:11, 12">⚓</a>Thus great wrath came from the Lord of hosts. </span>
<span class="verse xa_7_13"><sup>13</sup>Therefore it happened, <i>that</i> just as He proclaimed and they would not hear, so <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 1:24–28; Is. 1:15; Jer. 11:11; Mic. 3:4">⚓</a>they called out and I would not listen,” says the Lord of hosts. </span>
<span class="verse xa_7_14"><sup>14</sup>“But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:33; Deut. 4:27; 28:64; Neh. 1:8">⚓</a>I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they had not known. Thus the land became desolate after them, so that no one passed through or returned; for they made the pleasant land desolate.”<br/></span>
