<div class="title"><h3>Prophecy of the Shepherds</h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_11_4"> <sup>4</sup>Thus says the Lord my God, “Feed the flock for slaughter, </span>
<span class="verse xa_11_5"><sup>5</sup>whose owners slaughter them and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 2:3); 50:7">⚓</a>feel no guilt; those who sell them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:19; Hos. 12:8; 1 Tim. 6:9">⚓</a>say, ‘Blessed be the Lord, for I am rich’; and their shepherds do <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 34:2, 3">⚓</a>not pity them. </span>
<span class="verse xa_11_6"><sup>6</sup>For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land,” says the Lord. “But indeed I will give everyone into his neighbor’s hand and into the hand of his king. They shall attack the land, and I will not deliver <i>them</i> from their hand.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_11_7"> <sup>7</sup>So I fed the flock for slaughter, in particular <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 39:10; Zeph. 3:12; Matt. 11:5">⚓</a>the poor of the flock. I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bonds; and I fed the flock. </span>
<span class="verse xa_11_8"><sup>8</sup>I dismissed the three shepherds <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 5:7">⚓</a>in one month. My soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me. </span>
<span class="verse xa_11_9"><sup>9</sup>Then I said, “I will not feed you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 15:2">⚓</a>Let what is dying die, and what is perishing perish. Let those that are left eat each other’s flesh.” </span>
<span class="verse xa_11_10"><sup>10</sup>And I took my staff, Beauty, and cut it in two, that I might break the covenant which I had made with all the peoples. </span>
<span class="verse xa_11_11"><sup>11</sup>So it was broken on that day. Thus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zeph. 3:12; Matt. 27:50; Mark 15:37; Luke 23:46; Acts 8:32">⚓</a>the poor of the flock, who were watching me, knew that it <i>was</i> the word of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse xa_11_12"><sup>12</sup>Then I said to them, “If it is agreeable to you, give <i>me</i> my wages; and if not, refrain.” So they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:28; Ex. 21:32; Matt. 26:15; 27:9, 10">⚓</a>weighed out for my wages thirty <i>pieces</i> of silver.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_11_13"> <sup>13</sup>And the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:3–10; Acts 1:18, 19">⚓</a>potter”—that princely price they set on me. So I took the thirty <i>pieces</i> of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord for the potter. </span>
<span class="verse xa_11_14"><sup>14</sup>Then I cut in two my other staff, Bonds, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_11_15"> <sup>15</sup>And the Lord said to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 56:11; Ezek. 34:2">⚓</a>“Next, take for yourself the implements of a foolish shepherd. </span>
<span class="verse xa_11_16"><sup>16</sup>For indeed I will raise up a shepherd in the land <i>who</i> will not care for those who are cut off, nor seek the young, nor heal those that are broken, nor feed those that still stand. But he will eat the flesh of the fat and tear their hooves in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 34:1–10; Mic. 3:1–3">⚓</a>pieces.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_11_17">  <sup>17</sup>“Woe<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 23:1; Ezek. 34:2; Zech. 10:2; 11:15; John 10:12, 13">⚓</a> to the worthless shepherd,<br/>   Who leaves the flock!<br/>   A sword <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> against his arm<br/>   And against his right eye;<br/>   His arm shall completely wither,<br/>   And his right eye shall be totally blinded.”<br/></span>
