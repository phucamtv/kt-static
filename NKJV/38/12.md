<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>The Coming Deliverance of Judah</h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>The burden of the word of the Lord against Israel. Thus says the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 42:5; 44:24">⚓</a>who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:22; (Eccl. 12:7; Is. 57:16); Heb. 12:9">⚓</a>forms the spirit of man within him: </span>
<span class="verse xa_12_2"><sup>2</sup>“Behold, I will make Jerusalem <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 51:17">⚓</a>a cup of drunkenness to all the surrounding peoples, when they lay siege against Judah and Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse xa_12_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 12:4, 6, 8; 13:1">⚓</a>And it shall happen in that day that I will make Jerusalem <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:44">⚓</a>a very heavy stone for all peoples; all who would heave it away will surely be cut in pieces, though all nations of the earth are gathered against it. </span>
<span class="verse xa_12_4"><sup>4</sup>In that day,” says the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 76:6; Ezek. 38:4">⚓</a>“I will strike every horse with confusion, and its rider with madness; I will open My eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. </span>
<span class="verse xa_12_5"><sup>5</sup>And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem <i>are</i> my strength in the Lord of hosts, their God.’ </span>
<span class="verse xa_12_6"><sup>6</sup>In that day I will make the governors of Judah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 10:17, 18; Obad. 18; Zech. 11:1">⚓</a>like a firepan in the woodpile, and like a fiery torch in the sheaves; they shall devour all the surrounding peoples on the right hand and on the left, but Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place—Jerusalem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse xa_12_7"> <sup>7</sup>“The Lord will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall not become greater than that of Judah. </span>
<span class="verse xa_12_8"><sup>8</sup>In that day the Lord will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the one who is feeble among them in that day shall be like David, and the house of David <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> like God, like the Angel of the Lord before them. </span>
<span class="verse xa_12_9"><sup>9</sup>It shall be in that day <i>that</i> I will seek to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hag. 2:22">⚓</a>destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Mourning for the Pierced One</h3></div>
<span class="verse xa_12_10"> <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 31:9; 50:4; Ezek. 39:29; (Joel 2:28, 29)">⚓</a>“And I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 19:34, 37; 20:27; (Rev. 1:7)">⚓</a>look on Me whom they pierced. Yes, they will mourn for Him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 6:26; Amos 8:10">⚓</a>as one mourns for <i>his</i> only <i>son,</i> and grieve for Him as one grieves for a firstborn. </span>
<span class="verse xa_12_11"><sup>11</sup>In that day there shall be a great <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 24:30); Acts 2:37; (Rev. 1:7)">⚓</a>mourning in Jerusalem, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 23:29">⚓</a>like the mourning at Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. </span>
<span class="verse xa_12_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 24:30; Rev. 1:7)">⚓</a>And the land shall mourn, every family by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 3:31">⚓</a>Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves; </span>
<span class="verse xa_12_13"><sup>13</sup>the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of Shimei by itself, and their wives by themselves; </span>
<span class="verse xa_12_14"><sup>14</sup>all the families that remain, every family by itself, and their wives by themselves.<br/></span>
