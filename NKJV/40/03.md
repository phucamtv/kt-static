<span class="verse mat_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>In those days <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:1–12; Mark 1:3–8; Luke 3:2–17; John 1:6–8, 19–28">⚓</a>John the Baptist came preaching <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 14:10">⚓</a>in the wilderness of Judea, </span>
<span class="verse mat_3_2"><sup>2</sup>and saying, “Repent, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:44; Mal. 4:6; Matt. 4:17; Mark 1:15; Luke 1:17; 10:9; 11:20; 21:31">⚓</a>the kingdom of heaven is at hand!” </span>
<span class="verse mat_3_3"><sup>3</sup>For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 40:3; Luke 3:4; John 1:23">⚓</a>“The voice of one crying in the wilderness:<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:76">⚓</a>‘Prepare the way of the LORD;<br/>   Make His paths straight.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_3_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 1:8; Zech. 13:4; Matt. 11:8; Mark 1:6">⚓</a>John himself was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and his food was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:22">⚓</a>locusts and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 14:25, 26">⚓</a>wild honey. </span>
<span class="verse mat_3_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:5">⚓</a>Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him </span>
<span class="verse mat_3_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:4, 18">⚓</a>and were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_3_7"> <sup>7</sup>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:34; Luke 3:7–9">⚓</a>“Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 5:9; 1 Thess. 1:10)">⚓</a>the wrath to come? </span>
<span class="verse mat_3_8"><sup>8</sup>Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, </span>
<span class="verse mat_3_9"><sup>9</sup>and do not think to say to yourselves, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:33; Acts 13:26; (Rom. 4:1, 11, 16; Gal. 3:29)">⚓</a>‘We have Abraham as <i>our</i> father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. </span>
<span class="verse mat_3_10"><sup>10</sup>And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 92:12–14); Matt. 7:19; Luke 13:7, 9; (John 15:6)">⚓</a>Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. </span>
<span class="verse mat_3_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:4, 8; Luke 3:16; John 1:26; Acts 1:5">⚓</a>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 4:4; John 20:22; Acts 2:3, 4; 1 Cor. 12:13)">⚓</a>He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. </span>
<span class="verse mat_3_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 3:3">⚓</a>His winnowing fan <i>is</i> in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 4:1; Matt. 13:30">⚓</a>burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>John Baptizes Jesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_3_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:13–17; Mark 1:9–11; Luke 3:21, 22; John 1:31–34">⚓</a>Then Jesus came <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 2:22">⚓</a>from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_3_14"><sup>14</sup>And John <i>tried</i> <i>to</i> prevent Him, saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_3_15"> <sup>15</sup>But Jesus answered and said to him, <font color="red">“Permit <i>it to be so</i> now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.”</font> Then he allowed Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_3_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:10">⚓</a>When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 11:2); Luke 3:22; John 1:32; Acts 7:56">⚓</a>the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_3_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:28">⚓</a>And suddenly a voice <i>came</i> from heaven, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:7; Is. 42:1; Mark 1:11; Luke 1:35; 9:35; Col. 1:13">⚓</a>“This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”<br/></span>
