<span class="verse mat_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>When He had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:2–4; Mark 1:40–45; Luke 5:12–14">⚓</a>And behold, a leper came and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 2:11; 9:18; 15:25; John 9:38; Acts 10:25">⚓</a>worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_3"> <sup>3</sup>Then Jesus put out <i>His</i> hand and touched him, saying, <font color="red">“I am willing; be cleansed.”</font> Immediately his leprosy <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:5; Luke 4:27">⚓</a>was cleansed.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_4"> <sup>4</sup>And Jesus said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:30; Mark 5:43; Luke 4:41; 8:56; 9:21">⚓</a><font color="red">“See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 14:3, 4, 10; Mark 1:44; Luke 5:14">⚓</a><font color="red">Moses </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 14:4–32; Deut. 24:8">⚓</a><font color="red">commanded, as a testimony to them.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Heals a Centurion’s Servant</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_8_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:1–3">⚓</a>Now when Jesus had entered Capernaum, a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:54; Acts 10:1">⚓</a>centurion came to Him, pleading with Him, </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_6"><sup>6</sup>saying, “Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_7"> <sup>7</sup>And Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“I will come and heal him.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_8"> <sup>8</sup>The centurion answered and said, “Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 15:19, 21">⚓</a>I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 107:20">⚓</a>speak a word, and my servant will be healed. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_9"><sup>9</sup>For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this <i>one,</i> ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does <i>it.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_10"> <sup>10</sup>When Jesus heard <i>it,</i> He marveled, and said to those who followed, <font color="red">“Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">And I say to you that </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 12:3; Is. 2:2, 3; 11:10); Mal. 1:11; Luke 13:29; (Acts 10:45; 11:18; 14:27; Rom. 15:9–13; Eph. 3:6)">⚓</a><font color="red">many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">But </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 21:43)">⚓</a><font color="red">the sons of the kingdom </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:42, 50; 22:13; 24:51; 25:30; Luke 13:28; 2 Pet. 2:17; Jude 13">⚓</a><font color="red">will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_13"><sup>13</sup>Then Jesus said to the centurion, <font color="red">“Go your way; and as you have believed, <i>so</i> let it be done for you.”</font> And his servant was healed that same hour.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter’s Mother-in-Law Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_8_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:14–16; Mark 1:29–31; Luke 4:38, 39">⚓</a>Now when Jesus had come into Peter’s house, He saw <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 9:5">⚓</a>his wife’s mother lying sick with a fever. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_15"><sup>15</sup>So He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Many Healed in the Evening</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_8_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:32–34; Luke 4:40, 41">⚓</a>When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick, </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_17"><sup>17</sup>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:4; 1 Pet. 2:24">⚓</a>“He Himself took our infirmities<br/>   And bore our sicknesses.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Cost of Discipleship</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_8_18"> <sup>18</sup>And when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave a command to depart to the other side. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:19–22; Luke 9:57, 58">⚓</a>Then a certain scribe came and said to Him, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_20"> <sup>20</sup>And Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Foxes have holes and birds of the air <i>have</i> nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay <i>His</i> head.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 9:59, 60">⚓</a>Then another of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:20">⚓</a>let me first go and bury my father.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_22"> <sup>22</sup>But Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Wind and Wave Obey Jesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_8_23"> <sup>23</sup>Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 4:37; Luke 8:23–25">⚓</a>And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_25"><sup>25</sup>Then His disciples came to <i>Him</i> and awoke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_26"> <sup>26</sup>But He said to them, <font color="red">“Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?”</font> Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 65:7; 89:9; 107:29">⚓</a>He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_27"><sup>27</sup>So the men marveled, saying, “Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Two Demon-Possessed Men Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_8_28"> <sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:1–4; Luke 8:26–33">⚓</a>When He had come to the other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demon-possessed <i>men,</i> coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_29"><sup>29</sup>And suddenly they cried out, saying, “What have we to do with You, Jesus, You Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_30"> <sup>30</sup>Now a good way off from them there was a herd of many swine feeding. </span>
<span class="verse mat_8_31"><sup>31</sup>So the demons begged Him, saying, “If You cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_32"> <sup>32</sup>And He said to them, “Go.” So when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine. And suddenly the whole herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and perished in the water.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_33"> <sup>33</sup>Then those who kept <i>them</i> fled; and they went away into the city and told everything, including what <i>had</i> <i>happened</i> to the demon-possessed <i>men.</i></span>
<span class="verse mat_8_34"><sup>34</sup>And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 5:25; 1 Kin. 17:18; Amos 7:12; Luke 5:8; Acts 16:39">⚓</a>they begged <i>Him</i> to depart from their region.<br/></span>
