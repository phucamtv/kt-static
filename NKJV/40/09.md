<span class="verse mat_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>So He got into a boat, crossed over, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:13; 11:23; Mark 5:21">⚓</a>and came to His own city. </span>
<span class="verse mat_9_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 2:3–12; Luke 5:18–26">⚓</a>Then behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:10">⚓</a>When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, <font color="red">“Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_3"> <sup>3</sup>And at once some of the scribes said within themselves, “This Man blasphemes!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_4"> <sup>4</sup>But Jesus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 139:2; Matt. 12:25; Mark 12:15; Luke 5:22; 6:8; 9:47; 11:17">⚓</a>knowing their thoughts, said, <font color="red">“Why do you think evil in your hearts?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">For which is easier, to say, ‘<i>Your</i> sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk’?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins”</font>—then He said to the paralytic, <font color="red">“Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_7"><sup>7</sup>And he arose and departed to his house.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now when the multitudes saw <i>it,</i> they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:27; John 7:15">⚓</a>marveled and glorified God, who had given such power to men.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Matthew the Tax Collector</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_9_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 2:14; Luke 5:27">⚓</a>As Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, <font color="red">“Follow Me.”</font> So he arose and followed Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_10"> <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 2:15; Luke 5:29">⚓</a>Now it happened, as Jesus sat at the table in the house, <i>that</i> behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Him and His disciples. </span>
<span class="verse mat_9_11"><sup>11</sup>And when the Pharisees saw <i>it,</i> they said to His disciples, “Why does your Teacher eat with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:19; Mark 2:16; Luke 5:30; 15:2">⚓</a>tax collectors and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gal. 2:15)">⚓</a>sinners?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_12"> <sup>12</sup>When Jesus heard <i>that,</i> He said to them, <font color="red">“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">But go and learn what <i>this</i> means: </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 6:6; (Mic. 6:6–8); Matt. 12:7">⚓</a><font color="red">‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice.’ For I did not come to call the righteous, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 2:17; Luke 5:32; 1 Tim. 1:15">⚓</a><font color="red">but sinners, to repentance.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Is Questioned About Fasting</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_9_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 2:18; Luke 5:33–35; 18:12">⚓</a>“Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_15"> <sup>15</sup>And Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Can </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:29">⚓</a><font color="red">the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:2, 3; 14:23">⚓</a><font color="red">then they will fast.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins break, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_9_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:22–43; Luke 8:41–56">⚓</a>While He spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped Him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her and she will live.” </span>
<span class="verse mat_9_19"><sup>19</sup>So Jesus arose and followed him, and so <i>did</i> His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:2–4">⚓</a>disciples.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:25; Luke 8:43">⚓</a>And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 15:38; Deut. 22:12; Matt. 14:36; 23:5; Mark 6:56">⚓</a>touched the hem of His garment. </span>
<span class="verse mat_9_21"><sup>21</sup>For she said to herself, “If only I may touch His garment, I shall be made well.” </span>
<span class="verse mat_9_22"><sup>22</sup>But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, <font color="red">“Be of good cheer, daughter; </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:29; 15:28; Mark 5:34; 10:52; Luke 7:50; 8:48; 17:19; 18:42">⚓</a><font color="red">your faith has made you well.”</font> And the woman was made well from that hour.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_23"> <sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:38; Luke 8:51">⚓</a>When Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 35:25; Jer. 9:17; 16:6; Ezek. 24:17">⚓</a>the flute players and the noisy crowd wailing, </span>
<span class="verse mat_9_24"><sup>24</sup>He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:3; Acts 20:10">⚓</a><font color="red">“Make room, for the girl is not dead, but sleeping.”</font> And they ridiculed Him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_9_25"><sup>25</sup>But when the crowd was put outside, He went in and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:3, 15; Mark 1:31">⚓</a>took her by the hand, and the girl arose. </span>
<span class="verse mat_9_26"><sup>26</sup>And the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:24; Mark 1:28, 45; Luke 4:14, 37; 5:15; 7:17">⚓</a>report of this went out into all that land.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Two Blind Men Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_9_27"> <sup>27</sup>When Jesus departed from there, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:29–34">⚓</a>two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:22; Mark 10:47; Luke 18:38, 39">⚓</a>“Son of David, have mercy on us!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_28"> <sup>28</sup>And when He had come into the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Do you believe that I am able to do this?”</font><br/> They said to Him, “Yes, Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then He touched their eyes, saying, <font color="red">“According to your faith let it be to you.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_30"><sup>30</sup>And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:4; Luke 5:14">⚓</a><font color="red">“See <i>that</i> no one knows <i>it</i>.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_31"><sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:36">⚓</a>But when they had departed, they spread the news about Him in all that country.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Mute Man Speaks</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_9_32"> <sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:22, 24; Luke 11:14">⚓</a>As they went out, behold, they brought to Him a man, mute and demon-possessed. </span>
<span class="verse mat_9_33"><sup>33</sup>And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, “It was never seen like this in Israel!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_9_34"> <sup>34</sup>But the Pharisees said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15; John 7:20">⚓</a>“He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Compassion of Jesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_9_35"> <sup>35</sup>Then Jesus went about all the cities and villages, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:23">⚓</a>teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. </span>
<span class="verse mat_9_36"><sup>36</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:34">⚓</a>But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:17; 1 Kin. 22:17; Ezek. 34:5; Zech. 10:2; Mark 6:34">⚓</a>like sheep having no shepherd. </span>
<span class="verse mat_9_37"><sup>37</sup>Then He said to His disciples, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:2; John 4:35">⚓</a><font color="red">“The harvest truly <i>is</i> plentiful, but the laborers <i>are</i> few.</font></span>
