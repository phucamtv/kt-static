<span class="verse mat_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>On the same day Jesus went out of the house <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:1–15; Mark 4:1–12; Luke 8:4–10">⚓</a>and sat by the sea. </span>

<span class="verse mat_13_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">Some fell on stony places, where they did not have much earth; and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of earth.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">But when the sun was up they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered away.</font></span>

<div class="title"><h3>The Purpose of Parables</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_13_10"> <sup>10</sup>And the disciples came and said to Him, “Why do You speak to them in parables?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_11"> <sup>11</sup>He answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Because </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 11:25; 16:17); Mark 4:10, 11; (John 6:65; 1 Cor. 2:10; Col. 1:27; 1 John 2:20, 27)">⚓</a><font color="red">it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.</font></span>

<span class="verse mat_13_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.</font></span>

<span class="verse mat_13_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">So the servants of the owner came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The servants said to him, ‘Do you want us then to go and gather them up?’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">But he said, ‘No, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_13_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, “First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:12">⚓</a><font color="red">gather the wheat into my barn.” ’ ”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Mustard Seed</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_13_31"> <sup>31</sup>Another parable He put forth to them, saying: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 2:2, 3; Mic. 4:1); Mark 4:30; Luke 13:18, 19">⚓</a><font color="red">“The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,</font></span>
