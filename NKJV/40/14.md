<div class="title"><h1>14</h1><h3>John the Baptist Beheaded</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_14_1"> <sup>1</sup>At that time <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:14–29; Luke 9:7–9">⚓</a>Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_2"><sup>2</sup>and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.” </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:12; Mark 6:17; Luke 3:19, 20">⚓</a>For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him, and put <i>him</i> in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife. </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_4"><sup>4</sup>Because John had said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 18:16; 20:21">⚓</a>“It is not lawful for you to have her.” </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_5"><sup>5</sup>And although he wanted to put him to death, he feared the multitude, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:26; Luke 20:6">⚓</a>because they counted him as a prophet.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_6"> <sup>6</sup>But when Herod’s birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod. </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_7"><sup>7</sup>Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_8"> <sup>8</sup>So she, having been prompted by her mother, said, “Give me John the Baptist’s head here on a platter.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_9"> <sup>9</sup>And the king was sorry; nevertheless, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he commanded <i>it</i> to be given to <i>her.</i></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_10"><sup>10</sup>So he sent and had John beheaded in prison. </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_11"><sup>11</sup>And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought <i>it</i> to her mother. </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_12"><sup>12</sup>Then his disciples came and took away the body and buried it, and went and told Jesus.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Feeding the Five Thousand</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_14_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:23; 12:15; Mark 6:32–44; Luke 9:10–17; John 6:1, 2">⚓</a>When Jesus heard <i>it,</i> He departed from there by boat to a deserted place by Himself. But when the multitudes heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities. </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_14"><sup>14</sup>And when Jesus went out He saw a great multitude; and He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:36; Mark 6:34">⚓</a>was moved with compassion for them, and healed their sick. </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:35; Luke 9:12">⚓</a>When it was evening, His disciples came to Him, saying, “This is a deserted place, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_16"> <sup>16</sup>But Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_17"> <sup>17</sup>And they said to Him, “We have here only five loaves and two fish.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_18"> <sup>18</sup>He said, <font color="red">“Bring them here to Me.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_19"><sup>19</sup>Then He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:13; Matt. 15:36; 26:26; Mark 6:41; 8:7; 14:22; Luke 24:30; Acts 27:35; (Rom. 14:6)">⚓</a>He blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes. </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_20"><sup>20</sup>So they all ate and were filled, and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained. </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_21"><sup>21</sup>Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Walks on the Sea</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_14_22"> <sup>22</sup>Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, while He sent the multitudes away. </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:46; Luke 9:28; John 6:15">⚓</a>And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 6:16">⚓</a>Now when evening came, He was alone there. </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_24"><sup>24</sup>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_26"><sup>26</sup>And when the disciples saw Him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 9:8">⚓</a>walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It is a ghost!” And they cried out for fear.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_27"> <sup>27</sup>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <font color="red">“Be of good </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:11; 27:22, 25, 36">⚓</a><font color="red">cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_28"> <sup>28</sup>And Peter answered Him and said, “Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_29"> <sup>29</sup>So He said, <font color="red">“Come.”</font> And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_30"><sup>30</sup>But when he saw that the wind <i>was</i> boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_31"> <sup>31</sup>And immediately Jesus stretched out <i>His</i> hand and caught him, and said to him, <font color="red">“O you of </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 6:30; 8:26">⚓</a><font color="red">little faith, why did you doubt?”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_32"><sup>32</sup>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_14_33"> <sup>33</sup>Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, “Truly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:7; Matt. 16:16; 26:63; Mark 1:1; Luke 4:41; John 1:49; 6:69; 11:27; Acts 8:37; Rom. 1:4">⚓</a>You are the Son of God.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Many Touch Him and Are Made Well</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_14_34"> <sup>34</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:53; Luke 5:1">⚓</a>When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret. </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_35"><sup>35</sup>And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent out into all that surrounding region, brought to Him all who were sick, </span>
<span class="verse mat_14_36"><sup>36</sup>and begged Him that they might only <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mark 5:24–34)">⚓</a>touch the hem of His garment. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:20; Mark 3:10; (Luke 6:19); Acts 19:12">⚓</a>as many as touched <i>it</i> were made perfectly well.<br/></span>
