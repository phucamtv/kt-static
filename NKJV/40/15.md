<span class="verse mat_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:1; John 1:19; Acts 25:7">⚓</a>the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying, </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:5">⚓</a>“Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_3"> <sup>3</sup>He answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">For God commanded, saying, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:1, 12; Lev. 19:3; (Deut. 5:16); Prov. 23:22; (Eph. 6:2, 3)">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Honor your father and your mother’;  and, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 21:17; Lev. 20:9; Deut. 27:16; Prov. 20:20; 30:17">⚓</a><font color="red">‘He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:11, 12">⚓</a><font color="red">“Whatever profit you might have received from me <i>is</i> a gift <i>to God</i>”—</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">then he need not honor his father or mother.’ Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:6">⚓</a><font color="red">Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying:</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_8">  <sup>8</sup><font color="red">‘These</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 78:36; Is. 29:13; Ezek. 33:31">⚓</a> people <font color="red">draw near to Me with their mouth,</font><br/>   <font color="red">And honor Me with<i>their</i> lips,</font><br/>   <font color="red">But their heart is far from Me.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_9">   <sup>9</sup><font color="red">And in vain they worship Me,</font><br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 29:13; (Col. 2:18–22); Titus 1:14">⚓</a><font color="red">Teaching<i>as</i>doctrines the commandments of men.’”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_10"> <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:14">⚓</a>When He had called the multitude to <i>Himself,</i> He said to them, <font color="red">“Hear and understand:</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 10:15; Rom. 14:14, 17, 20; 1 Tim. 4:4; Titus 1:15)">⚓</a><font color="red">Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then His disciples came and said to Him, “Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_13"> <sup>13</sup>But He answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 60:21; 61:3; John 15:2; 1 Cor. 3:12, 13)">⚓</a><font color="red">“Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">Let them alone. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 9:16; Mal. 2:8; Matt. 23:16, 24; Luke 6:39; Rom. 2:19">⚓</a><font color="red">They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a ditch.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:17">⚓</a>Then Peter answered and said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_16"> <sup>16</sup>So Jesus said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:9; Mark 7:18">⚓</a><font color="red">“Are you also still without understanding?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">Do you not yet understand that </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 6:13)">⚓</a><font color="red">whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">But </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 12:34); Mark 7:20; (James 3:6)">⚓</a><font color="red">those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 6:5; 8:21; Prov. 6:14; Jer. 17:9; Mark 7:21; (Rom. 1:29–32; Gal. 5:19–21)">⚓</a><font color="red">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">These are <i>the things</i> which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Gentile Shows Her Faith</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_15_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:24–30">⚓</a>Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_22"><sup>22</sup>And behold, a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him, saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:1; 22:41, 42">⚓</a>Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_23"> <sup>23</sup>But He answered her not a word.<br/> And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, “Send her away, for she cries out after us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_24"> <sup>24</sup>But He answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:5, 6; (Rom. 15:8)">⚓</a><font color="red">“I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, help me!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_26"> <sup>26</sup>But He answered and said, <font color="red">“It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw <i>it</i> to the little </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 7:6; Phil. 3:2">⚓</a><font color="red">dogs.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_27"> <sup>27</sup>And she said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then Jesus answered and said to her, <font color="red">“O woman, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:9">⚓</a><font color="red">great <i>is</i> your faith! Let it be to you as you desire.”</font> And her daughter was healed from that very hour.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Heals Great Multitudes</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_15_29"> <sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:29–31; Mark 7:31–37">⚓</a>Jesus departed from there, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:18">⚓</a>skirted the Sea of Galilee, and went up on the mountain and sat down there. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 35:5, 6; Matt. 11:5; Luke 7:22">⚓</a>Then great multitudes came to Him, having with them <i>the</i> lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus’ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:25; Luke 7:38; 8:41; 10:39">⚓</a>feet, and He healed them. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_31"><sup>31</sup>So the multitude marveled when they saw <i>the</i> mute speaking, <i>the</i> maimed made whole, <i>the</i> lame walking, and <i>the</i> blind seeing; and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 5:25, 26; 19:37, 38">⚓</a>glorified the God of Israel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Feeding the Four Thousand</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_15_32"> <sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 8:1–10">⚓</a>Now Jesus called His disciples to <i>Himself</i> and said, <font color="red">“I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_33"> <sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:43">⚓</a>Then His disciples said to Him, “Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to fill such a great multitude?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_34"> <sup>34</sup>Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“How many loaves do you have?”</font><br/> And they said, “Seven, and a few little fish.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_15_35"> <sup>35</sup>So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_36"><sup>36</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:19; 26:27; Luke 22:17, 19; John 6:11, 23; Acts 27:35; (Rom. 14:6)">⚓</a>He took the seven loaves and the fish and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:13; Luke 22:19">⚓</a>gave thanks, broke <i>them</i> and gave <i>them</i> to His disciples; and the disciples <i>gave</i> to the multitude. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_37"><sup>37</sup>So they all ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets full of the fragments that were left. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_38"><sup>38</sup>Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. </span>
<span class="verse mat_15_39"><sup>39</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 8:10">⚓</a>And He sent away the multitude, got into the boat, and came to the region of Magdala.<br/></span>
