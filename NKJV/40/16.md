<span class="verse mat_16_2"><sup>2</sup>He answered and said to them, <font color="red">“When it is evening you say, ‘<i>It will be</i> fair weather, for the sky is red’;</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">and in the morning, ‘<i>It will be</i> foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot <i>discern</i> the signs of the times.</font></span>

<span class="verse mat_16_7"> <sup>7</sup>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> because we have taken no bread.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_8"> <sup>8</sup>But Jesus, being aware of <i>it,</i> said to them, <font color="red">“O you of little faith, why do you reason among yourselves because you have brought no bread?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_16_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:15–21; Mark 6:30–44; Luke 9:10–17; John 6:1–14">⚓</a><font color="red">Do you not yet understand, or remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took up?</font></span>
