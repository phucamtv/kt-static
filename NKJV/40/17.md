<span class="verse mat_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:1–8; Mark 9:2–8; Luke 9:28–36">⚓</a>after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, led them up on a high mountain by themselves; </span>
<span class="verse mat_17_2"><sup>2</sup>and He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light. </span>
<span class="verse mat_17_3"><sup>3</sup>And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_17_4"><sup>4</sup>Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 1:17">⚓</a>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:7; Matt. 3:17; Mark 1:11; Luke 1:35; 3:22; (John 12:28–30)">⚓</a>“This is My beloved Son, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 42:1; Matt. 3:17; 12:18; 2 Pet. 1:17">⚓</a>in whom I am well pleased. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 18:15, 19; Acts 3:22, 23)">⚓</a>Hear Him!” </span>
<span class="verse mat_17_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 1:18">⚓</a>And when the disciples heard <i>it,</i> they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid. </span>
<span class="verse mat_17_7"><sup>7</sup>But Jesus came and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 8:18">⚓</a>touched them and said, <font color="red">“Arise, and do not be afraid.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_8"><sup>8</sup>When they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_9"> <sup>9</sup>Now as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, <font color="red">“Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is risen from the dead.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_10"> <sup>10</sup>And His disciples asked Him, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 4:5; Matt. 11:14; 16:14; Mark 9:11">⚓</a>“Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_11"> <sup>11</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Indeed, Elijah is coming first and will </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mal. 4:6); Luke 1:17">⚓</a><font color="red">restore all things.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:14; Mark 9:12, 13">⚓</a><font color="red">But I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:3, 10">⚓</a><font color="red">did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. Likewise </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:21">⚓</a><font color="red">the Son of Man is also about to suffer at their hands.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:14">⚓</a>Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them of John the Baptist.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Boy Is Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_17_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:14–19; Mark 9:14–28; Luke 9:37–42">⚓</a>And when they had come to the multitude, a man came to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying, </span>
<span class="verse mat_17_15"><sup>15</sup>“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and suffers severely; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water. </span>
<span class="verse mat_17_16"><sup>16</sup>So I brought him to Your disciples, but they could not cure him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then Jesus answered and said, <font color="red">“O faithless and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:5; Phil. 2:15">⚓</a><font color="red">perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_18"><sup>18</sup>And Jesus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:41">⚓</a>rebuked the demon, and it came out of him; and the child was cured from that very hour.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not cast it out?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_20"> <sup>20</sup>So Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Because of your unbelief; for assuredly, I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:21; Mark 11:23; Luke 17:6; (1 Cor. 12:9)">⚓</a><font color="red">if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.”</font><br/></span>

<span class="verse mat_17_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">and they will kill Him, and the third day He will be raised up.”</font> And they were exceedingly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:22; 27:50; Luke 23:46; 24:46; John 16:6; 19:30; Acts 10:40">⚓</a>sorrowful.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter and His Master Pay Their Taxes</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_17_24"> <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 9:33">⚓</a>When they had come to Capernaum, those who received the <i>temple</i> tax came to Peter and said, “Does your Teacher not pay the <i>temple</i> tax?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_25"> <sup>25</sup>He said, “Yes.”<br/> And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, <font color="red">“What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 60:10–17)">⚓</a><font color="red">strangers?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_26"> <sup>26</sup>Peter said to Him, “From strangers.”<br/> Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Then the sons are free.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_17_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">Nevertheless, lest we offend them, go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for Me and you.”</font><br/></span>
