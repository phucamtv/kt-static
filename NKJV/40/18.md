<span class="verse mat_18_2"> <sup>2</sup>Then Jesus called a little <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:14; Mark 10:14; Luke 18:14–17">⚓</a>child to Him, set him in the midst of them, </span>

<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_18_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Peter came to Him and said, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 17:4">⚓</a>Up to seven times?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_22"> <sup>22</sup>Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“I do not say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 6:14; Mark 11:25); Col. 3:13">⚓</a><font color="red">up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">And when he had begun to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">But as he was not able to pay, his master commanded </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 21:2; Lev. 25:39; 2 Kin. 4:1; Neh. 5:5, 8">⚓</a><font color="red">that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and that payment be made.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">The servant therefore fell down before him, saying, ‘Master, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took <i>him</i> by the throat, saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">And he would not, but went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were very grieved, and came and told their master all that had been done.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:41–43">⚓</a><font color="red">all that debt because you begged me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">And his master was angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_18_35"> <sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 21:13; Matt. 6:12; Mark 11:26; James 2:13">⚓</a><font color="red">“So My heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you, from his heart, does not forgive his brother his trespasses.”</font><br/></span>
