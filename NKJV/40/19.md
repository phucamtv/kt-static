<div class="title"><h1>19</h1><h3>Marriage and Divorce</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:1–9; Mark 10:1–12; John 10:40">⚓</a>when Jesus had finished these sayings, <i>that</i> He departed from Galilee and came to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan. </span>
<span class="verse mat_19_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:15">⚓</a>And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them there.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_3"> <sup>3</sup>The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for <i>just</i> any reason?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_4"> <sup>4</sup>And He answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Have you not read that He who made<i>them</i> at the beginning </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:27; 5:2; (Mal. 2:15)">⚓</a><font color="red">‘made them male and female,’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">and said, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:24; Mark 10:5–9; Eph. 5:31">⚓</a><font color="red">‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 6:16; 7:2)">⚓</a><font color="red">the two shall become one flesh’?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_7"> <sup>7</sup>They said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 24:1–4; Matt. 5:31">⚓</a>“Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_8"> <sup>8</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“Moses, because of the </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 3:15">⚓</a><font color="red">hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 2:16">⚓</a><font color="red">wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 5:32); Mark 10:11; Luke 16:18; 1 Cor. 7:10">⚓</a><font color="red">And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_10"> <sup>10</sup>His disciples said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 21:19)">⚓</a>“If such is the case of the man with <i>his</i> wife, it is better not to marry.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Teaches on Celibacy</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_19_11"> <sup>11</sup>But He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 7:2, 7, 9, 17)">⚓</a><font color="red">“All cannot accept this saying, but only <i>those</i> to whom it has been given:</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">For there are eunuchs who were born thus from <i>their</i> mother’s womb, and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 7:32)">⚓</a><font color="red">there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He who is able to accept <i>it,</i> let him accept <i>it.”</i></font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Blesses Little Children</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_19_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:31; Mark 10:13; Luke 18:15">⚓</a>Then little children were brought to Him that He might put <i>His</i> hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them. </span>
<span class="verse mat_19_14"><sup>14</sup>But Jesus said, <font color="red">“Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:3, 4; Mark 10:15; Luke 18:17; (1 Cor. 14:20; 1 Pet. 2:2)">⚓</a><font color="red">of such is the kingdom of heaven.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_15"><sup>15</sup>And He laid <i>His</i> hands on them and departed from there.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Counsels the Rich Young Ruler</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_19_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:16–29; Mark 10:17–30; Luke 18:18–30">⚓</a>Now behold, one came and said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:25">⚓</a>“Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_17"> <sup>17</sup>So He said to him, <font color="red">“Why do you call Me good?No one <i>is</i></font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 25:8; 34:8; Nah. 1:7; (Rom. 2:4)">⚓</a><font color="red">good but One, <i>that is,</i> God. But if you want to enter into life, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 18:5; Deut. 4:40; 6:17; 7:11; 11:22; 28:9; Neh. 9:29; Ezek. 20:21; (Gal. 3:10)">⚓</a><font color="red">keep the commandments.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_18"> <sup>18</sup>He said to Him, “Which ones?”<br/> Jesus said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:13–16; Deut. 5:17–20">⚓</a><font color="red">“‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:12–16; Deut. 5:16–20; Matt. 15:4">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Honor your father and<i>your</i>mother,’ and, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:18; Matt. 22:39; (Rom. 13:9; Gal. 5:14; James 2:8)">⚓</a><font color="red">‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_20"> <sup>20</sup>The young man said to Him, “All these things I have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Phil. 3:6, 7)">⚓</a>kept from my youth. What do I still lack?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_21"> <sup>21</sup>Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“If you want to be perfect, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 6:20; Luke 12:33; Acts 2:45; 4:34, 35; 1 Tim. 6:18, 19">⚓</a><font color="red">go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_22"> <sup>22</sup>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>With God All Things Are Possible</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_19_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then Jesus said to His disciples, <font color="red">“Assuredly, I say to you that </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 13:22); Mark 10:24; 1 Cor. 1:26; (1 Tim. 6:9)">⚓</a><font color="red">it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_25"> <sup>25</sup>When His disciples heard <i>it,</i> they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_26"> <sup>26</sup>But Jesus looked at <i>them</i> and said to them, <font color="red">“With men this is impossible, but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:14; Num. 11:23; Job 42:2; Is. 59:1; Jer. 32:17; Zech. 8:6; Luke 1:37">⚓</a><font color="red">with God all things are possible.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_27"> <sup>27</sup>Then Peter answered and said to Him, “See, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:9; Matt. 4:20; Luke 5:11">⚓</a>we have left all and followed You. Therefore what shall we have?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_28"> <sup>28</sup>So Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Assuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:21; Luke 22:28–30; (1 Cor. 6:2; Rev. 2:26)">⚓</a><font color="red">you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_29"><sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 6:33); Mark 10:29, 30; Luke 18:29, 30">⚓</a><font color="red">And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_19_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 20:16; 21:31, 32); Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30">⚓</a><font color="red">But many <i>who are</i> first will be last, and the last first.</font><br/></span>
