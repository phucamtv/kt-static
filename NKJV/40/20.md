<span class="verse mat_20_1"> <sup>1</sup><font color="red">“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">and said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they went.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle all day?’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_8"> <sup>8</sup><font color="red">“So when evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the laborers and give them <i>their</i> wages, beginning with the last to the first.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">And when those came who <i>were hired</i> about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received each a denarius.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">And when they had received <i>it,</i> they complained against the landowner,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">saying, ‘These last <i>men</i> have worked <i>only</i> one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">But he answered one of them and said, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">Take <i>what is</i> yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man <i>the same</i> as to you.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_20_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 9:20, 21)">⚓</a><font color="red">Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things?
