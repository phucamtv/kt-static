<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>The Triumphal Entry</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 11:1–10; Luke 19:29–38">⚓</a>when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Zech. 14:4)">⚓</a>the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_2"><sup>2</sup>saying to them, <font color="red">“Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Loose <i>them</i> and bring <i>them</i> to Me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord has need of them,’ and immediately he will send them.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_4"> <sup>4</sup>All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying:<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_5">  <sup>5</sup>“Tell<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 62:11; Zech. 9:9; John 12:15">⚓</a> the daughter of Zion,<br/>   ‘Behold, your King is coming to you,<br/>   Lowly, and sitting on a donkey,<br/>   A colt, the foal of a donkey.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_6"> <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 11:4">⚓</a>So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_7"><sup>7</sup>They brought the donkey and the colt, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:13">⚓</a>laid their clothes on them, and set <i>Him</i> on them. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_8"><sup>8</sup>And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:40; John 12:13">⚓</a>others cut down branches from the trees and spread <i>them</i> on the road. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_9"><sup>9</sup>Then the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying:<br/>  “Hosanna to the Son of David!<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 118:26; Matt. 23:39">⚓</a>‘Blessed <i>is</i> He who comes in the name of the LORD!’<br/>   Hosanna in the highest!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_10"> <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 2:13, 15">⚓</a>And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, “Who is this?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_11"> <sup>11</sup>So the multitudes said, “This is Jesus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 18:15, 18); Matt. 2:23; 16:14; Luke 4:16–29; John 6:14; 7:40; 9:17; (Acts 3:22, 23)">⚓</a>the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_21_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 3:1; Mark 11:15–18; Luke 19:45–47; John 2:13–16">⚓</a>Then Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 14:25">⚓</a>money changers and the seats of those who sold doves. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_13"><sup>13</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“It is written, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 56:7">⚓</a><font color="red">‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:11">⚓</a><font color="red">‘den of thieves.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then <i>the</i> blind and <i>the</i> lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_15"><sup>15</sup>But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:1; John 7:42">⚓</a>Son of David!” they were indignant </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_16"><sup>16</sup>and said to Him, “Do You hear what these are saying?”<br/> And Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Yes. Have you never read,</font><br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 8:2; Matt. 11:25">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants</font><br/>   <font color="red">You have perfected praise’?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then He left them and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:6; Mark 11:1, 11, 12; 14:3; Luke 19:29; 24:50; John 11:1, 18; 12:1">⚓</a>went out of the city to Bethany, and He lodged there.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Fig Tree Withered</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_21_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 11:12–14, 20–24">⚓</a>Now in the morning, as He returned to the city, He was hungry. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 11:13">⚓</a>And seeing a fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves, and said to it, <font color="red">“Let no fruit grow on you ever again.”</font> Immediately the fig tree withered away.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Lesson of the Withered Fig Tree</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_21_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 11:20">⚓</a>And when the disciples saw <i>it,</i> they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree wither away so soon?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_21"> <sup>21</sup>So Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Assuredly, I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:20">⚓</a><font color="red">if you have faith and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="James 1:6">⚓</a><font color="red">do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 13:2">⚓</a><font color="red">but also if you say to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be cast into the sea,’ it will be done.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">And </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 7:7–11; Mark 11:24; Luke 11:9; (John 15:7; James 5:16; 1 John 3:22; 5:14)">⚓</a><font color="red">whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus’ Authority Questioned</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_21_23"> <sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 11:27–33; Luke 20:1–8">⚓</a>Now when He came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people confronted Him as He was teaching, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:14; Acts 4:7; 7:27">⚓</a>said, “By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_24"> <sup>24</sup>But Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things:</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">The </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:29–34)">⚓</a><font color="red">baptism of </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:15–28">⚓</a><font color="red">John—where was it from? From heaven or from men?”</font><br/> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_26"><sup>26</sup>But if we say, ‘From men,’ we <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:5; 21:46; Luke 20:6">⚓</a>fear the multitude, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:5; Mark 6:20">⚓</a>for all count John as a prophet.” </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_27"><sup>27</sup>So they answered Jesus and said, “We do not know.”<br/> And He said to them, <font color="red">“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Two Sons</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_21_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, ‘Son, go, work today in my </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:1; 21:33">⚓</a><font color="red">vineyard.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">He answered and said, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he regretted it and went.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">Then he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said, ‘I <i>go,</i> sir,’ but he did not go.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">Which of the two did the will of <i>his</i> father?”</font><br/> They said to Him, “The first.”<br/> Jesus said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:29, 37–50">⚓</a><font color="red">“Assuredly, I say to you that tax collectors and harlots enter the kingdom of God before you.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">For </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 3:1–12; 7:29">⚓</a><font color="red">John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 3:12, 13">⚓</a><font color="red">but tax collectors and harlots believed him; and when you saw <i>it,</i> you did not afterward relent and believe him.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Wicked Vinedressers</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_21_33"> <sup>33</sup><font color="red">“Hear another parable: There was a certain landowner </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 80:9; Mark 12:1–12; Luke 20:9–19">⚓</a><font color="red">who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a winepress in it and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 25:14">⚓</a><font color="red">went into a far country.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">Now when vintage-time drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive its fruit.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_35"><sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 24:21; 36:16; (Matt. 23:34, 37; Acts 7:52; 1 Thess. 2:15); Heb. 11:36, 37">⚓</a><font color="red">And the vinedressers took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did likewise to them.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">Then last of all he sent his </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 3:16)">⚓</a><font color="red">son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 2:8; Heb. 1:2)">⚓</a><font color="red">‘This is the heir. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 2:2); John 11:53; Acts 4:27">⚓</a><font color="red">Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.’</font></span>

<span class="verse mat_21_40"> <sup>40</sup><font color="red">“Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_41"> <sup>41</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 20:16">⚓</a>They said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 21:24)">⚓</a>“He will destroy those wicked men miserably, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 8:11; Acts 13:46; Rom. 9; 10)">⚓</a>and lease <i>his</i> vineyard to other vinedressers who will render to him the fruits in their seasons.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_21_42"> <sup>42</sup>Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Have you never read in the Scriptures:</font><br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 118:22, 23; Is. 28:16; Mark 12:10; Luke 20:17; Acts 4:11; (Rom. 9:33); Eph. 2:20; (1 Pet. 2:6, 7)">⚓</a><font color="red">‘The stone which the builders rejected</font><br/>   <font color="red">Has become the chief cornerstone.</font><br/>   <font color="red">This was the LORD’s doing,</font><br/>   <font color="red">And it is marvelous in our eyes’?</font><br/></span>

<span class="verse mat_21_45"> <sup>45</sup>Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking of them. </span>
<span class="verse mat_21_46"><sup>46</sup>But when they sought to lay hands on Him, they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:26; Mark 11:18, 32">⚓</a>feared the multitudes, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:11; Luke 7:16; John 7:40">⚓</a>they took Him for a prophet.<br/></span>
