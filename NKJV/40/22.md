<span class="verse mat_22_1"> <sup>1</sup>And Jesus answered <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 14:16; (Rev. 19:7–9)">⚓</a>and spoke to them again by parables and said: </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">“The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they were not willing to come.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">Again, he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my dinner; </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 9:2">⚓</a><font color="red">my oxen and fatted cattle <i>are</i> killed, and all things <i>are</i> ready. Come to the wedding.” ’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">And the rest seized his servants, treated <i>them</i>spitefully, and killed <i>them.</i></font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">But when the king heard <i>about it,</i> he was furious. And he sent out </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 9:26)">⚓</a><font color="red">his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:11">⚓</a><font color="red">worthy.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">So those servants went out into the highways and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:38, 47, 48; (Acts 28:28)">⚓</a><font color="red">gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. And the wedding <i>hall</i> was filled with guests.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_11"> <sup>11</sup><font color="red">“But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 5:3; Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10, 12; Rev. 3:4; 16:15; 19:8)">⚓</a><font color="red">who did not have on a wedding garment.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">So he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 3:19)">⚓</a><font color="red">speechless.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast <i>him</i></font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:12; 25:30; Luke 13:28">⚓</a><font color="red">into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:16">⚓</a><font color="red">“For many are called, but few <i>are</i> chosen.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Pharisees: Is It Lawful to Pay Taxes to Caesar?</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_22_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 12:13–17; Luke 20:20–26">⚓</a>Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle Him in <i>His</i> talk. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_16"><sup>16</sup>And they sent to Him their disciples with the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 3:6; 8:15; 12:13">⚓</a>Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that You are true, and teach the way of God in truth; nor do You care about anyone, for You do not regard the person of men. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_17"><sup>17</sup>Tell us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_18"> <sup>18</sup>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, <font color="red">“Why do you test Me, <i>you</i> hypocrites?</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">Show Me the tax money.”</font><br/> So they brought Him a denarius.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_20"> <sup>20</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“Whose image and inscription <i>is</i> this?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_21"> <sup>21</sup>They said to Him, “Caesar’s.”<br/> And He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:25">⚓</a><font color="red">“Render therefore to Caesar the things that are </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 13:1–7; 1 Pet. 2:13–15)">⚓</a><font color="red">Caesar’s, and to God the things that are </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 3:23; 6:19, 20; 12:27)">⚓</a><font color="red">God’s.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_22"><sup>22</sup>When they had heard <i>these</i> <i>words,</i> they marveled, and left Him and went their way.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Sadducees: What About the Resurrection?</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_22_23"> <sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 12:18–27; Luke 20:27–40">⚓</a>The same day the Sadducees, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:8">⚓</a>who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and asked Him, </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_24"><sup>24</sup>saying: “Teacher, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 25:5">⚓</a>Moses said that if a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_25"><sup>25</sup>Now there were with us seven brothers. The first died after he had married, and having no offspring, left his wife to his brother. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_26"><sup>26</sup>Likewise the second also, and the third, even to the seventh. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_27"><sup>27</sup>Last of all the woman died also. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_28"><sup>28</sup>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_29"> <sup>29</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“You are mistaken, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 20:9">⚓</a><font color="red">not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 John 3:2)">⚓</a><font color="red">are like angels of God in heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_32"><sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:7; 26:24; 28:21; Ex. 3:6, 15; Mark 12:26; Luke 20:37; Acts 7:32; (Heb. 11:16)">⚓</a><font color="red">‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_33"><sup>33</sup>And when the multitudes heard <i>this,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 7:28">⚓</a>they were astonished at His teaching.<br/></span>

<span class="verse mat_22_34"> <sup>34</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 12:28–31; Luke 10:25–37">⚓</a>But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_35"><sup>35</sup>Then one of them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:30; 10:25; 11:45, 46, 52; 14:3; Titus 3:13">⚓</a>a lawyer, asked <i>Him</i> <i>a</i> <i>question,</i> testing Him, and saying, </span>
<span class="verse mat_22_36"><sup>36</sup>“Teacher, which <i>is</i> the great commandment in the law?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_37"> <sup>37</sup>Jesus said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:5; 10:12; 30:6">⚓</a><font color="red">“‘You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">This is <i>the</i> first and great commandment.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_22_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">And <i>the</i> second <i>is</i> like it: </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:18; Matt. 19:19; Mark 12:31; Luke 10:27; (Rom. 13:9; Gal. 5:14; James 2:8)">⚓</a><font color="red">‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’</font></span>

<span class="verse mat_22_43"> <sup>43</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“How then does David in the Spirit call Him ‘Lord,’ saying:</font><br/></span>
