<span class="verse mat_26_10"> <sup>10</sup>But when Jesus was aware of <i>it,</i> He said to them, <font color="red">“Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work for Me.</font></span>

<span class="verse mat_26_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, “Rabbi, is it I?”<br/> He said to him, <font color="red">“You have said it.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Institutes the Lord’s Supper</h3></div>

<span class="verse mat_26_33"> <sup>33</sup>Peter answered and said to Him, “Even if all are made to stumble because of You, I will never be made to stumble.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_26_34"> <sup>34</sup>Jesus said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:74, 75; Mark 14:30; Luke 22:34; John 13:38">⚓</a><font color="red">“Assuredly, I say to you that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_26_35"> <sup>35</sup>Peter said to Him, “Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!”<br/> And so said all the disciples.<br/></span>

<span class="verse mat_26_39"> <sup>39</sup>He went a little farther and fell on His face, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 14:36; Luke 22:42; (Heb. 5:7–9)">⚓</a>prayed, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:27">⚓</a><font color="red">“O My Father, if it is possible, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:22">⚓</a><font color="red">let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 40:8; Is. 50:5; John 5:30; 6:38; Phil. 2:8">⚓</a><font color="red">not as I will, but as You <i>will.</i>”</font><br/></span>

<span class="verse mat_26_45"><sup>45</sup>Then He came to His disciples and said to them, <font color="red">“Are <i>you</i> still sleeping and resting?

<span class="verse mat_26_55"> <sup>55</sup>In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, <font color="red">“Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take Me? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me.</font></span>
