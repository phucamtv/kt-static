<span class="verse mat_27_1"> <sup>1</sup>When morning came, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:2; Mark 15:1; Luke 22:66; 23:1; John 18:28">⚓</a>all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put Him to death. </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_2"><sup>2</sup>And when they had bound Him, they led Him away and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:19; Luke 18:32; Acts 3:13">⚓</a>delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Judas Hangs Himself</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_27_3"> <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:14">⚓</a>Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that He had been condemned, was remorseful and brought back the thirty <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:15">⚓</a>pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_4"><sup>4</sup>saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.”<br/> And they said, “What <i>is</i> <i>that</i> to us? You see <i>to</i> <i>it!</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 17:23; Matt. 18:7; 26:24; John 17:12; Acts 1:18">⚓</a>departed, and went and hanged himself.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_6"> <sup>6</sup>But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.” </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_7"><sup>7</sup>And they consulted together and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in. </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_8"><sup>8</sup>Therefore that field has been called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:19">⚓</a>the Field of Blood to this day.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 11:12">⚓</a>“And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the value of Him who was priced, whom they of the children of Israel priced, </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_10"><sup>10</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 32:6–9; Zech. 11:12, 13">⚓</a>gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Faces Pilate</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_27_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now Jesus stood before the governor. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 15:2–5; Luke 23:2, 3; John 18:29–38">⚓</a>And the governor asked Him, saying, “Are You the King of the Jews?”<br/> Jesus said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 18:37; 1 Tim. 6:13">⚓</a><font color="red">“<i>It is as</i> you say.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_12"><sup>12</sup>And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 38:13, 14; Matt. 26:63; John 19:9">⚓</a>He answered nothing.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then Pilate said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:62; John 19:10">⚓</a>“Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?” </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_14"><sup>14</sup>But He answered him not one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Taking the Place of Barabbas</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_27_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 15:6–15; Luke 23:17–25; John 18:39—19:16">⚓</a>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to releasing to the multitude one prisoner whom they wished. </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_16"><sup>16</sup>And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_17"><sup>17</sup>Therefore, when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_18"><sup>18</sup>For he knew that they had handed Him over because of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:38; (John 15:22–25)">⚓</a>envy.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_19"> <sup>19</sup>While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 15:11; Luke 23:18; John 18:40; Acts 3:14">⚓</a>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_21"><sup>21</sup>The governor answered and said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”<br/> They said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:14">⚓</a>“Barabbas!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_22"> <sup>22</sup>Pilate said to them, “What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?”<br/> <i>They</i> all said to him, “Let Him be crucified!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then the governor said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:13">⚓</a>“Why, what evil has He done?”<br/> But they cried out all the more, saying, “Let Him be crucified!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_24"> <sup>24</sup>When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but rather <i>that</i> a tumult was rising, he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 21:6–8">⚓</a>took water and washed <i>his</i> hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this just Person. You see <i>to</i> <i>it.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_25"> <sup>25</sup>And all the people answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 19:10; Josh. 2:19; 2 Sam. 1:16; 1 Kin. 2:32; Acts 5:28">⚓</a>“His blood <i>be</i> on us and on our children.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then he released Barabbas to them; and when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 50:6; 53:5); Matt. 20:19; Mark 15:15; Luke 23:16, 24, 25; John 19:1, 16">⚓</a>he had scourged Jesus, he delivered <i>Him</i> to be crucified.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Soldiers Mock Jesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_27_27"> <sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 15:16–20; John 19:2">⚓</a>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around Him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_28"><sup>28</sup>And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 15:17; John 19:2">⚓</a>stripped Him and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:11">⚓</a>put a scarlet robe on Him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_29"><sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:19; Is. 53:3; Matt. 20:19; Mark 10:34; Luke 18:32">⚓</a>When they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put <i>it</i> on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_30"><sup>30</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 50:6; 52:14; Mic. 5:1; Matt. 26:67; Mark 10:34; 14:65; 15:19">⚓</a>they spat on Him, and took the reed and struck Him on the head. </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_31"><sup>31</sup>And when they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him, put His <i>own</i> clothes on Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:7; Matt. 20:19">⚓</a>and led Him away to be crucified.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The King on a Cross</h3></div>

<span class="verse mat_27_33"><sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 15:22–32; Luke 23:33–43; John 19:17">⚓</a>And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull, </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_34"><sup>34</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:21; Matt. 27:48">⚓</a>they gave Him sour wine mingled with gall to drink. But when He had tasted <i>it,</i> He would not drink.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_35"> <sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 15:24; Luke 23:34; John 19:24">⚓</a>Then they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:18">⚓</a>“They divided My garments among them,<br/>   And for My clothing they cast lots.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_36"> <sup>36</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:17; Matt. 27:54">⚓</a>Sitting down, they kept watch over Him there. </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_37"><sup>37</sup>And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 15:26; Luke 23:38; John 19:19">⚓</a>put up over His head the accusation written against Him:<br/> <aside style="text-align:center;">THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</aside><br/></span>

<span class="verse mat_27_39"> <sup>39</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 16:4; Ps. 22:7; 109:25; Lam. 2:15; Mark 15:29; Luke 23:35">⚓</a>those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_40"><sup>40</sup>and saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:61; John 2:19">⚓</a>“You who destroy the temple and build <i>it</i> in three days, save Yourself! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:63">⚓</a>If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_41"> <sup>41</sup>Likewise the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and elders, said, </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_42"><sup>42</sup>“He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 18:11; John 3:14, 15)">⚓</a>saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him. </span>

<span class="verse mat_27_46"><sup>46</sup>And about the ninth hour <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 5:7)">⚓</a>Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, <font color="red">“Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” that is, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:1">⚓</a><font color="red">“My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_47"> <sup>47</sup>Some of those who stood there, when they heard <i>that,</i> said, “This Man is calling for Elijah!” </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_48"><sup>48</sup>Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:21; Mark 15:36; Luke 23:36; John 19:29">⚓</a>filled <i>it</i> with sour wine and put <i>it</i> on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_49"> <sup>49</sup>The rest said, “Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save Him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_50"> <sup>50</sup>And Jesus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 15:37; Luke 23:46; John 19:30">⚓</a>cried out again with a loud voice, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:26; Zech. 11:10, 11; Matt. 17:23; (John 10:18; 1 Cor. 15:3)">⚓</a>yielded up His spirit.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_51"> <sup>51</sup>Then, behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 26:31; 2 Chr. 3:14; Zech. 11:10; Mark 15:38; Luke 23:45; Heb. 9:3">⚓</a>the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split, </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_52"><sup>52</sup>and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_53"><sup>53</sup>and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_54"> <sup>54</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 15:39; Luke 23:47">⚓</a>So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:33">⚓</a>“Truly this was the Son of God!”<br/></span>

<span class="verse mat_27_58"><sup>58</sup>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given to him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_59"><sup>59</sup>When Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_60"><sup>60</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:9; Matt. 26:12">⚓</a>laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, and departed. </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_61"><sup>61</sup>And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Pilate Sets a Guard</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_27_62"> <sup>62</sup>On the next day, which followed the Day of Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered together to Pilate, </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_63"><sup>63</sup>saying, “Sir, we remember, while He was still alive, how that deceiver said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:21; 17:23; 20:19; 26:61; Mark 8:31; 10:34; Luke 9:22; 13:33; 24:6, 7; John 2:19">⚓</a><font color="red">‘After three days I will rise.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_64"><sup>64</sup>Therefore command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal Him <i>away,</i> and say to the people, ‘He has risen from the dead.’ So the last deception will be worse than the first.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_27_65"> <sup>65</sup>Pilate said to them, “You have a guard; go your way, make <i>it</i> as secure as you know how.” </span>
<span class="verse mat_27_66"><sup>66</sup>So they went and made the tomb secure, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 6:17">⚓</a>sealing the stone and setting the guard.<br/></span>
