<div class="title"><h1>28</h1><h3>He Is Risen</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_28_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:1–8; Luke 24:1–10; John 20:1–8">⚓</a>after the Sabbath, as the first <i>day</i> of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:56, 61">⚓</a>and the other Mary came to see the tomb. </span>
<span class="verse mat_28_2"><sup>2</sup>And behold, there was a great earthquake; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:5; Luke 24:4; John 20:12">⚓</a>an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it. </span>
<span class="verse mat_28_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:9; 10:6; Mark 9:3; John 20:12; Acts 1:10">⚓</a>His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. </span>
<span class="verse mat_28_4"><sup>4</sup>And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 1:17">⚓</a>dead <i>men.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_28_5"> <sup>5</sup>But the angel answered and said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. </span>
<span class="verse mat_28_6"><sup>6</sup>He is not here; for He is risen, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 6:2; Ps. 16:10; 49:15; Matt. 12:40; 16:21; 17:23; 20:19">⚓</a>as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. </span>
<span class="verse mat_28_7"><sup>7</sup>And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:32; 28:10, 16; Mark 16:7">⚓</a>He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_28_8"> <sup>8</sup>So they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring His disciples word.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Women Worship the Risen Lord</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_28_9"> <sup>9</sup>And as they went to tell His disciples, behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:9; John 20:14">⚓</a>Jesus met them, saying, <font color="red">“Rejoice!”</font> So they came and held Him by the feet and worshiped Him. </span>
<span class="verse mat_28_10"><sup>10</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Do not be afraid. Go <i>and</i> tell </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:22; John 20:17; Rom. 8:29; (Heb. 2:11)">⚓</a><font color="red">My brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Soldiers Are Bribed</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_28_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened. </span>
<span class="verse mat_28_12"><sup>12</sup>When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, </span>
<span class="verse mat_28_13"><sup>13</sup>saying, “Tell them, ‘His disciples came at night and stole Him <i>away</i> while we slept.’ </span>
<span class="verse mat_28_14"><sup>14</sup>And if this comes to the governor’s ears, we will appease him and make you secure.” </span>
<span class="verse mat_28_15"><sup>15</sup>So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Great Commission</h3></div>
<span class="verse mat_28_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:32; 28:7, 10; Mark 14:28; 15:41; 16:7">⚓</a>which Jesus had appointed for them. </span>
<span class="verse mat_28_17"><sup>17</sup>When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 20:24–29">⚓</a>doubted.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mat_28_18"> <sup>18</sup>And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 7:13, 14); Matt. 11:27; Luke 1:32; 10:22; John 3:35; Acts 2:36; Rom. 14:9; 1 Cor. 15:27; (Eph. 1:10, 21); Phil. 2:9, 10; (Heb. 1:2); 1 Pet. 3:22">⚓</a><font color="red">“All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_28_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:15">⚓</a><font color="red">Go therefore and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 52:10; Luke 24:47; (Acts 2:38, 39); Rom. 10:18; Col. 1:23">⚓</a><font color="red">make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</font></span>
<span class="verse mat_28_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 2:42)">⚓</a><font color="red">teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 4:31; 18:10; 23:11)">⚓</a><font color="red">with you always, <i>even</i> to the end of the age.” Amen.</font><br/></span>
