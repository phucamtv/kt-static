<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralytic</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>And again <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:1">⚓</a>He entered Capernaum after <i>some</i> days, and it was heard that He was in the house. </span>
<span class="verse mac_2_2"><sup>2</sup>Immediately many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive <i>them,</i> not even near the door. And He preached the word to them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_2_3"><sup>3</sup>Then they came to Him, bringing a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:24; 8:6; Acts 8:7; 9:33">⚓</a>paralytic who was carried by four <i>men.</i></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_4"><sup>4</sup>And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, <font color="red">“Son, your sins are forgiven you.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_6"> <sup>6</sup>And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, </span>
<span class="verse mac_2_7"><sup>7</sup>“Why does this <i>Man</i> speak blasphemies like this? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 14:4; Is. 43:25; Dan. 9:9">⚓</a>Who can forgive sins but God alone?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_8"> <sup>8</sup>But immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, <font color="red">“Why do you reason about these things in your hearts?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:5">⚓</a><font color="red">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘<i>Your</i> sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Arise, take up your bed and walk’?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins”</font>—He said to the paralytic, </span>
<span class="verse mac_2_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">“I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_12"><sup>12</sup>Immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went out in the presence of them all, so that all were amazed and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:31; (Phil. 2:11)">⚓</a>glorified God, saying, “We never saw <i>anything</i> like this!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Matthew the Tax Collector</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_2_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:9">⚓</a>Then He went out again by the sea; and all the multitude came to Him, and He taught them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_2_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:9–13; Luke 5:27–32">⚓</a>As He passed by, He saw Levi the <i>son</i> of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:19; 8:22; 19:21; John 1:43; 12:26; 21:22">⚓</a><font color="red">“Follow Me.”</font> So he arose and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 18:28">⚓</a>followed Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:10">⚓</a>Now it happened, as He was dining in <i>Levi’s</i> house, that many tax collectors and sinners also sat together with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_2_16"><sup>16</sup>And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, “How <i>is</i> <i>it</i> that He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_17"> <sup>17</sup>When Jesus heard <i>it,</i> He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:12, 13; 18:11; Luke 5:31, 32; 19:10">⚓</a><font color="red">“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call <i>the</i> righteous, but sinners, to repentance.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Is Questioned About Fasting</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_2_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:14–17; Luke 5:33–38">⚓</a>The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting. Then they came and said to Him, “Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_19"> <sup>19</sup>And Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Can the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">But the days will come when the bridegroom will be </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:9; 13:2, 3; 14:23">⚓</a><font color="red">taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; or else the new piece pulls away from the old, and the tear is made worse.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine bursts the wineskins, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_2_23"> <sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:1–8; Luke 6:1–5">⚓</a>Now it happened that He went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; and as they went His disciples began <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 23:25">⚓</a>to pluck the heads of grain. </span>
<span class="verse mac_2_24"><sup>24</sup>And the Pharisees said to Him, “Look, why do they do what is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:10; 31:15">⚓</a>not lawful on the Sabbath?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_25"> <sup>25</sup>But He said to them, <font color="red">“Have you never read </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 21:1–6">⚓</a><font color="red">what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him:</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">how he went into the house of God <i>in the days</i> of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the showbread, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:32, 33; Lev. 24:5–9">⚓</a><font color="red">which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and also gave some to those who were with him?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_27"> <sup>27</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:3; Ex. 23:12; Deut. 5:14; Neh. 9:14; Ezek. 20:12">⚓</a><font color="red">Sabbath.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_2_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">Therefore </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:8">⚓</a><font color="red">the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.”</font><br/></span>
