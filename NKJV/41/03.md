<span class="verse mac_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:9–14; Luke 6:6–11">⚓</a>He entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_2"><sup>2</sup>So they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 37:32); Luke 14:1; 20:20">⚓</a>watched Him closely, whether He would <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 13:14">⚓</a>heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_3"><sup>3</sup>And He said to the man who had the withered hand, <font color="red">“Step forward.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_4"><sup>4</sup>Then He said to them, <font color="red">“Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?”</font> But they kept silent. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_5"><sup>5</sup>And when He had looked around at them with anger, being grieved by the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 7:12">⚓</a>hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, <font color="red">“Stretch out your hand.”</font> And he stretched <i>it</i> out, and his hand was restored as whole as the other. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:2; Mark 12:13">⚓</a>Then the Pharisees went out and immediately plotted with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:16">⚓</a>the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Great Multitude Follows Jesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_3_7"> <sup>7</sup>But Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:25; Luke 6:17">⚓</a>and from Judea </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_8"><sup>8</sup>and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan; and those from Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard how <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:19">⚓</a>many things He was doing, came to Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_9"><sup>9</sup>So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the multitude, lest they should crush Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_10"><sup>10</sup>For He healed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:29, 34; Luke 7:21">⚓</a>many, so that as many as had afflictions pressed about Him to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:21; 14:36; Mark 6:56; 8:22">⚓</a>touch Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:23, 24; Luke 4:41">⚓</a>And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, fell down before Him and cried out, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:29; 14:33; Mark 1:1; 5:7; Luke 8:28">⚓</a>“You are the Son of God.” </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_12"><sup>12</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:16; Mark 1:25, 34">⚓</a>He sternly warned them that they should not make Him known.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Twelve Apostles</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_3_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:1; Mark 6:7; Luke 9:1">⚓</a>And He went up on the mountain and called to <i>Him</i> those He Himself wanted. And they came to Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_14"><sup>14</sup>Then He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach, </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_15"><sup>15</sup>and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_16"><sup>16</sup>Simon, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:18; John 1:42">⚓</a>to whom He gave the name Peter; </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_17"><sup>17</sup>James the <i>son</i> of Zebedee and John the brother of James, to whom He gave the name Boanerges, that is, “Sons of Thunder”; </span>

<span class="verse mac_3_19"><sup>19</sup>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him. And they went into a house.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A House Divided Cannot Stand</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_3_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then the multitude came together again, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:31">⚓</a>so that they could not so much as eat bread. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_21"><sup>21</sup>But when His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:8; Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3; John 2:12">⚓</a>own people heard <i>about</i> <i>this,</i> they went out to lay hold of Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:5; 10:20; Acts 26:24; (2 Cor. 5:13)">⚓</a>for they said, “He is out of His mind.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_22"> <sup>22</sup>And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:34; 10:25; Luke 11:15; John 7:20; 8:48, 52; 10:20">⚓</a>“He has Beelzebub,” and, “By the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11; Eph. 2:2)">⚓</a>ruler of the demons He casts out demons.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_23"> <sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:25–29; Luke 11:17–22">⚓</a>So He called them to <i>Himself</i> and said to them in parables: <font color="red">“How can Satan cast out Satan?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 49:24, 25); Matt. 12:29">⚓</a><font color="red">No one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man.

<div class="title"><h3>The Unpardonable Sin</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_3_28"> <sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:31, 32; Luke 12:10; (1 John 5:16)">⚓</a><font color="red">“Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter;</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation”</font>— </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_30"><sup>30</sup>because they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:34; John 7:20; 8:48, 52; 10:20">⚓</a>said, “He has an unclean spirit.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus’ Mother and Brothers Send for Him</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_3_31"> <sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:46–50; Luke 8:19–21">⚓</a>Then His brothers and His mother came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_3_32"><sup>32</sup>And a multitude was sitting around Him; and they said to Him, “Look, Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking You.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_33"> <sup>33</sup>But He answered them, saying, <font color="red">“Who is My mother, or My brothers?”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_34"><sup>34</sup>And He looked around in a circle at those who sat about Him, and said, <font color="red">“Here are My mother and My brothers!</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_3_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">For whoever does the </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 6:6; Heb. 10:36; 1 Pet. 4:2; (1 John 2:17)">⚓</a><font color="red">will of God is My brother and My sister and mother.”</font><br/></span>
