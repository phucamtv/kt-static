<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>The Parable of the Sower</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:1–15; Luke 8:4–10">⚓</a>again He began to teach by the sea. And a great multitude was gathered to Him, so that He got into a boat and sat <i>in</i> <i>it</i> on the sea; and the whole multitude was on the land facing the sea. </span>
<span class="verse mac_4_2"><sup>2</sup>Then He taught them many things by parables, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 12:38">⚓</a>and said to them in His teaching:<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_3"> <sup>3</sup><font color="red">“Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">And it happened, as he sowed, <i>that</i> some <i>seed</i> fell by the wayside; and the birds of the air came and devoured it.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">Some fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">But when the sun was up it was scorched, and because it had no root it withered away.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">And some <i>seed</i> fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no crop.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">But other <i>seed</i> fell on good ground and yielded a crop that sprang up, increased and produced: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_9"> <sup>9</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Purpose of Parables</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_4_10"> <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:10; Luke 8:9">⚓</a>But when He was alone, those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable. </span>
<span class="verse mac_4_11"><sup>11</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“To you it has been given to </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 11:25; 1 Cor. 2:10–16; 2 Cor. 4:6)">⚓</a><font color="red">know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 5:12, 13; Col. 4:5; 1 Thess. 4:12; 1 Tim. 3:7)">⚓</a><font color="red">those who are outside, all things come in parables,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">so that</font><br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 6:9, 10; 43:8; Jer. 5:21; Ezek. 12:2; Matt. 13:14; Luke 8:10; John 12:40; Rom. 11:8">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Seeing they may see and not perceive,</font><br/>   <font color="red">And hearing they may hear and not understand;</font><br/>   <font color="red">Lest they should turn,</font><br/>   <font color="red">And<i>their</i>sins be forgiven them.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Sower Explained</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:18–23; Luke 8:11–15">⚓</a><font color="red">The sower sows the word.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">And these are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown. When they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">These likewise are the ones sown on stony ground who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">and they have no root in themselves, and so endure only for a time. Afterward, when tribulation or persecution arises for the word’s sake, immediately they stumble.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">Now these are the ones sown among thorns; <i>they are</i> the ones who hear the word,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">and the </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 21:34">⚓</a><font color="red">cares of this world, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 23:5; Eccl. 5:13; Luke 18:24; 1 Tim. 6:9, 10, 17">⚓</a><font color="red">the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">But these are the ones sown on good ground, those who hear the word, accept <i>it,</i> and bear </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 15:2, 5; Rom. 7:4)">⚓</a><font color="red">fruit: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Light Under a Basket</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_4_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 5:15; Luke 8:16; 11:33">⚓</a>Also He said to them, <font color="red">“Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 12:14; Matt. 10:26, 27; Luke 12:3; (1 Cor. 4:5)">⚓</a><font color="red">For there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:15; 13:9, 43; Mark 4:9; Luke 8:8; 14:35; Rev. 3:6, 13, 22; 13:9">⚓</a><font color="red">If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then He said to them, <font color="red">“Take heed what you hear. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 7:2; Luke 6:38; 2 Cor. 9:6">⚓</a><font color="red">With the same measure you use, it will be measured to you; and to you who hear, more will be given.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_25"><sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:12; 25:29; Luke 8:18; 19:26">⚓</a><font color="red">For whoever has, to him more will be given; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Growing Seed</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_4_26"> <sup>26</sup>And He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 13:24–30, 36–43); Luke 8:1">⚓</a><font color="red">“The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 3:18; 2 Pet. 3:18)">⚓</a><font color="red">grow, he himself does not know how.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">For the earth </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 12:24)">⚓</a><font color="red">yields crops by itself: first the blade, then the head, after that the full grain in the head.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">But when the grain ripens, immediately </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mark 13:30, 39); Rev. 14:15">⚓</a><font color="red">he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Mustard Seed</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_4_30"> <sup>30</sup>Then He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:31, 32; Luke 13:18, 19; (Acts 2:41; 4:4; 5:14; 19:20)">⚓</a><font color="red">“To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we picture it?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red"><i>It is</i> like a mustard seed which, when it is sown on the ground, is smaller than all the seeds on earth;</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out large branches, so that the birds of the air may nest under its shade.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus’ Use of Parables</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_4_33"> <sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:34, 35; (John 16:12)">⚓</a>And with many such parables He spoke the word to them as they were able to hear <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_34"><sup>34</sup>But without a parable He did not speak to them. And when they were alone, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:27, 45">⚓</a>He explained all things to His disciples.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Wind and Wave Obey Jesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_4_35"> <sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:18, 23–27; Luke 8:22, 25">⚓</a>On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, <font color="red">“Let us cross over to the other side.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_36"><sup>36</sup>Now when they had left the multitude, they took Him along in the boat as He was. And other little boats were also with Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_4_37"><sup>37</sup>And a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling. </span>
<span class="verse mac_4_38"><sup>38</sup>But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. And they awoke Him and said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 23:8–10)">⚓</a>“Teacher, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 44:23">⚓</a>do You not care that we are perishing?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_39"> <sup>39</sup>Then He arose and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 9:25; Luke 4:39">⚓</a>rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 65:7; 89:9; 93:4; 104:6, 7; Matt. 8:26; Luke 8:24">⚓</a><font color="red">“Peace, be still!”</font> And the wind ceased and there was a great calm. </span>
<span class="verse mac_4_40"><sup>40</sup>But He said to them, <font color="red">“Why are you so fearful? </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:31, 32; Luke 8:25">⚓</a><font color="red">How<i>is it</i> that you have no faith?”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_4_41"><sup>41</sup>And they feared exceedingly, and said to one another, “Who can this be, that even the wind and the sea obey Him!”<br/></span>
