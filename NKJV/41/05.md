<span class="verse mac_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:28–34; Luke 8:26–37">⚓</a>they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_2"><sup>2</sup>And when He had come out of the boat, immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:23; 7:25; (Rev. 16:13, 14)">⚓</a>unclean spirit, </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_3"><sup>3</sup>who had <i>his</i> dwelling among the tombs; and no one could bind him, not even with chains, </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_4"><sup>4</sup>because he had often been bound with shackles and chains. And the chains had been pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces; neither could anyone tame him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_5"><sup>5</sup>And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and cutting himself with stones.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_6"> <sup>6</sup>When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_7"><sup>7</sup>And he cried out with a loud voice and said, “What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:63; Mark 1:24; Acts 19:13">⚓</a>implore You by God that You do not torment me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_8"> <sup>8</sup>For He said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:25; 9:25; (Acts 16:18)">⚓</a><font color="red">“Come out of the man, unclean spirit!”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_9"><sup>9</sup>Then He asked him, <font color="red">“What <i>is</i> your name?”</font><br/> And he answered, saying, “My name <i>is</i> Legion; for we are many.” </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_10"><sup>10</sup>Also he begged Him earnestly that He would not send them out of the country.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now a large herd of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:7, 8; Deut. 14:8; Luke 15:15, 16">⚓</a>swine was feeding there near the mountains. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_12"><sup>12</sup>So all the demons begged Him, saying, “Send us to the swine, that we may enter them.” </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_13"><sup>13</sup>And at once Jesus gave them permission. Then the unclean spirits went out and entered the swine (there were about two thousand); and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and drowned in the sea.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_14"> <sup>14</sup>So those who fed the swine fled, and they told <i>it</i> in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that had happened. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_15"><sup>15</sup>Then they came to Jesus, and saw the one <i>who</i> <i>had</i> <i>been</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:24; 8:16; Mark 1:32">⚓</a>demon-possessed and had the legion, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:39">⚓</a>sitting and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 61:10)">⚓</a>clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_16"><sup>16</sup>And those who saw it told them how it happened to him <i>who</i> <i>had</i> <i>been</i> demon-possessed, and about the swine. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_17"><sup>17</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:34; Acts 16:39">⚓</a>they began to plead with Him to depart from their region.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_18"> <sup>18</sup>And when He got into the boat, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 8:38, 39">⚓</a>he who had been demon-possessed begged Him that he might be with Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_19"><sup>19</sup>However, Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, <font color="red">“Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_20"><sup>20</sup>And he departed and began to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:2; Ps. 66:16">⚓</a>proclaim in Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him; and all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:8, 33; John 5:20; 7:21; Acts 3:12; 4:13">⚓</a>marveled.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_5_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:1; Luke 8:40">⚓</a>Now when Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a great multitude gathered to Him; and He was by the sea. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:18–26; Luke 8:41–56; Acts 13:15">⚓</a>And behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue came, Jairus by name. And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_23"><sup>23</sup>and begged Him earnestly, saying, “My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:15; Mark 6:5; 7:32; 8:23, 25; 16:18; Luke 4:40; Acts 9:17; 28:8">⚓</a>lay Your hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live.” </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_24"><sup>24</sup>So <i>Jesus</i> went with him, and a great multitude followed Him and thronged Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now a certain woman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 15:19, 25; Matt. 9:20">⚓</a>had a flow of blood for twelve years, </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_26"><sup>26</sup>and had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_27"><sup>27</sup>When she heard about Jesus, she came behind <i>Him</i> in the crowd and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:35, 36; Mark 3:10; 6:56">⚓</a>touched His garment. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_28"><sup>28</sup>For she said, “If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_29"> <sup>29</sup>Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in <i>her</i> body that she was healed of the affliction. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_30"><sup>30</sup>And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 6:19; 8:46">⚓</a>power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, <font color="red">“Who touched My clothes?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_31"> <sup>31</sup>But His disciples said to Him, “You see the multitude thronging You, and You say, <font color="red">‘Who touched Me?’</font> ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_32"> <sup>32</sup>And He looked around to see her who had done this thing. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_33"><sup>33</sup>But the woman, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 89:7)">⚓</a>fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_34"><sup>34</sup>And He said to her, <font color="red">“Daughter, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:22; Mark 10:52; Acts 14:9">⚓</a><font color="red">your faith has made you well. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 1:17; 20:42; 2 Kin. 5:19; Luke 7:50; 8:48; Acts 16:36; (James 2:16)">⚓</a><font color="red">Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_35"> <sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 8:49">⚓</a>While He was still speaking, <i>some</i> came from the ruler of the synagogue’s <i>house</i> who said, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_36"> <sup>36</sup>As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue, <font color="red">“Do not be afraid; only </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mark 9:23; John 11:40)">⚓</a><font color="red">believe.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_37"><sup>37</sup>And He permitted no one to follow Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_38"><sup>38</sup>Then He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw a tumult and those who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:10; Acts 9:39">⚓</a>wept and wailed loudly. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_39"><sup>39</sup>When He came in, He said to them, <font color="red">“Why make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:4, 11">⚓</a><font color="red">sleeping.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_40"> <sup>40</sup>And they ridiculed Him. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:40">⚓</a>But when He had put them all outside, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those <i>who</i> <i>were</i> with Him, and entered where the child was lying. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_41"><sup>41</sup>Then He took the child by the hand, and said to her, <font color="red">“Talitha, cumi,”</font> which is translated, <font color="red">“Little girl, I say to you, arise.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_5_42"><sup>42</sup>Immediately the girl arose and walked, for she was twelve years <i>of</i> <i>age.</i> And they were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:27; 7:37">⚓</a>overcome with great amazement. </span>
<span class="verse mac_5_43"><sup>43</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 8:4; 12:16–19; 17:9); Mark 3:12">⚓</a>He commanded them strictly that no one should know it, and said that <i>something</i> should be given her to eat.<br/></span>
