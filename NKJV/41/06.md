<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Jesus Rejected at Nazareth</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:54; Luke 4:16">⚓</a>He went out from there and came to His own country, and His disciples followed Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_2"><sup>2</sup>And when the Sabbath had come, He began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing <i>Him</i> were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 7:28; Luke 4:32; Acts 4:13">⚓</a>astonished, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 6:42">⚓</a>“Where <i>did</i> this Man <i>get</i> these things? And what wisdom <i>is</i> this which is given to Him, that such mighty works are performed by His hands! </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_3"><sup>3</sup>Is this not the carpenter, the Son of Mary, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:46; Gal. 1:19">⚓</a>brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?” So they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 11:6)">⚓</a>were offended at Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_4"> <sup>4</sup>But Jesus said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:57; Luke 4:24; John 4:44">⚓</a><font color="red">“A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:22; 32:25; Matt. 13:58; (Mark 9:23)">⚓</a>Now He could do no mighty work there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed <i>them.</i></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_6"><sup>6</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 59:16; Matt. 17:17, 20; (Heb. 3:18, 19; 4:2)">⚓</a>He marveled because of their unbelief. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:35; Luke 13:22; Acts 10:38; Eph. 2:17">⚓</a>Then He went about the villages in a circuit, teaching.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Sending Out the Twelve</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_6_7"> <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:1; 28:19, 20; Mark 3:13, 14; Luke 9:1">⚓</a>And He called the twelve to <i>Himself,</i> and began to send them out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eccl. 4:9, 10)">⚓</a>two <i>by</i> two, and gave them power over unclean spirits. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_8"><sup>8</sup>He commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staff—no bag, no bread, no copper in <i>their</i> money belts— </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_9"><sup>9</sup>but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 6:15)">⚓</a>to wear sandals, and not to put on two tunics.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_10"> <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:11; Luke 9:4; 10:7, 8">⚓</a>Also He said to them, <font color="red">“In whatever place you enter a house, stay there till you depart from that place.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:14; Luke 10:10">⚓</a><font color="red">And whoever will not receive you nor hear you, when you depart from there, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:51; 18:6">⚓</a><font color="red">shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them.Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_12"> <sup>12</sup>So they went out and preached that <i>people</i> should repent. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_13"><sup>13</sup>And they cast out many demons, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(James 5:14)">⚓</a>and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed <i>them.</i><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>John the Baptist Beheaded</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_6_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:1–12; Mark 6:14–16; Luke 9:7–9">⚓</a>Now King Herod heard <i>of</i> <i>Him,</i> for His name had become well known. And he said, “John the Baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 19:37">⚓</a>these powers are at work in him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:14; Mark 8:28; Luke 9:19">⚓</a>Others said, “It is Elijah.”<br/> And others said, “It is the Prophet, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:11">⚓</a>or like one of the prophets.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:2; Luke 3:19">⚓</a>But when Herod heard, he said, “This is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!” </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_17"><sup>17</sup>For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife; for he had married her. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_18"><sup>18</sup>Because John had said to Herod, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 18:16; 20:21">⚓</a>“It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_19"> <sup>19</sup>Therefore Herodias held it against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not; </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_20"><sup>20</sup>for Herod <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:5; 21:26">⚓</a>feared John, knowing that he <i>was</i> a just and holy man, and he protected him. And when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:6">⚓</a>Then an opportune day came when Herod <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 40:20">⚓</a>on his birthday gave a feast for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief <i>men</i> of Galilee. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_22"><sup>22</sup>And when Herodias’ daughter herself came in and danced, and pleased Herod and those who sat with him, the king said to the girl, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will give <i>it</i> to you.” </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_23"><sup>23</sup>He also swore to her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Esth. 5:3, 6, 7:2">⚓</a>“Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half my kingdom.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_24"> <sup>24</sup>So she went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?”<br/> And she said, “The head of John the Baptist!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_25"> <sup>25</sup>Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_26"> <sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:9">⚓</a>And the king was exceedingly sorry; <i>yet,</i> because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he did not want to refuse her. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_27"><sup>27</sup>Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in prison, </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_28"><sup>28</sup>brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_29"><sup>29</sup>When his disciples heard <i>of</i> <i>it,</i> they came and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 13:29, 30; Matt. 27:58–61; Acts 8:2">⚓</a>took away his corpse and laid it in a tomb.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Feeding the Five Thousand</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_6_30"> <sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 9:10">⚓</a>Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_31"><sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:13">⚓</a>And He said to them, <font color="red">“Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.”</font> For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 3:20">⚓</a>there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_32"><sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:13–21; Luke 9:10–17; John 6:5–13">⚓</a>So they departed to a deserted place in the boat by themselves.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_33"> <sup>33</sup>But the multitudes saw them departing, and many <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Col. 1:6)">⚓</a>knew Him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_34"><sup>34</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:36; 14:14; (Heb. 5:2)">⚓</a>And Jesus, when He came out, saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 27:17; 1 Kin. 22:17; 2 Chr. 18:16; Zech. 10:2">⚓</a>sheep not having a shepherd. So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 48:17; 61:1–3); Luke 9:11">⚓</a>He began to teach them many things. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_35"><sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:15; Luke 9:12">⚓</a>When the day was now far spent, His disciples came to Him and said, “This is a deserted place, and already the hour <i>is</i> late. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_36"><sup>36</sup>Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_37"> <sup>37</sup>But He answered and said to them, <font color="red">“You give them something to eat.”</font><br/> And they said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:13, 22; 2 Kin. 4:43">⚓</a>“Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them <i>something</i> to eat?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_38"> <sup>38</sup>But He said to them, <font color="red">“How many loaves do you have? Go and see.”</font><br/> And when they found out they said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:17; Luke 9:13; John 6:9">⚓</a>“Five, and two fish.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_39"> <sup>39</sup>Then He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:35; Mark 8:6">⚓</a>commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_40"><sup>40</sup>So they sat down in ranks, in hundreds and in fifties. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_41"><sup>41</sup>And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fish, He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:41, 42">⚓</a>looked up to heaven, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:13; Matt. 15:36; 26:26; Mark 8:7; Luke 24:30">⚓</a>blessed and broke the loaves, and gave <i>them</i> to His disciples to set before them; and the two fish He divided among <i>them</i> all. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_42"><sup>42</sup>So they all ate and were filled. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_43"><sup>43</sup>And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of the fish. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_44"><sup>44</sup>Now those who had eaten the loaves were about five thousand men.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Walks on the Sea</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_6_45"> <sup>45</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:22–32; John 6:15–21">⚓</a>Immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He sent the multitude away. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_46"><sup>46</sup>And when He had sent them away, He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:35; Luke 5:16">⚓</a>departed to the mountain to pray. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_47"><sup>47</sup>Now when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He <i>was</i> alone on the land. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_48"><sup>48</sup>Then He saw them straining at rowing, for the wind was against them. Now about the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:28">⚓</a>would have passed them by. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_49"><sup>49</sup>And when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed it was a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:26; Luke 24:37">⚓</a>ghost, and cried out; </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_50"><sup>50</sup>for they all saw Him and were troubled. But immediately He talked with them and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:2; John 16:33">⚓</a><font color="red">“Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 41:10">⚓</a><font color="red">afraid.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_6_51"><sup>51</sup>Then He went up into the boat to them, and the wind <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 107:29">⚓</a>ceased. And they were greatly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:27; 2:12; 5:42; 7:37">⚓</a>amazed in themselves beyond measure, and marveled. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_52"><sup>52</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:9–11; Mark 8:17, 18">⚓</a>they had not understood about the loaves, because their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 63:17; Mark 3:5; 16:14">⚓</a>heart was hardened.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Many Touch Him and Are Made Well</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_6_53"> <sup>53</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:34–36; John 6:24, 25">⚓</a>When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and anchored there. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_54"><sup>54</sup>And when they came out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him, </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_55"><sup>55</sup>ran through that whole surrounding region, and began to carry about on beds those who were sick to wherever they heard He was. </span>
<span class="verse mac_6_56"><sup>56</sup>Wherever He entered, into villages, cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged Him that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:20; Mark 5:27, 28; (Acts 19:12)">⚓</a>they might just touch the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 15:38, 39">⚓</a>hem of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made well.<br/></span>
