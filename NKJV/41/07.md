<span class="verse mac_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:1–20">⚓</a>the Pharisees and some of the scribes came together to Him, having come from Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_2"><sup>2</sup>Now when they saw some of His disciples eat bread with defiled, that is, with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:20">⚓</a>unwashed hands, they found fault. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_3"><sup>3</sup>For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash <i>their</i> hands in a special way, holding the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:5, 8, 9, 13; Gal. 1:14; 1 Pet. 1:18">⚓</a>tradition of the elders. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_4"><sup>4</sup><i>When</i> <i>they</i> <i>come</i> from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other things which they have received and hold, <i>like</i> the washing of cups, pitchers, copper vessels, and couches.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:2">⚓</a>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_6"> <sup>6</sup>He answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Well did Isaiah prophesy of you </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 23:13–29">⚓</a><font color="red">hypocrites, as it is written:</font><br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 29:13">⚓</a><font color="red">‘This people honors Me with<i>their</i>lips,</font><br/>   <font color="red">But their heart is far from Me.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_7">   <sup>7</sup><font color="red">And in vain they worship Me,</font><br/>   <font color="red">Teaching<i>as</i>doctrines the commandments of men.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_8"> <sup>8</sup><font color="red">For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and many other such things you do.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_9"> <sup>9</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“<i>All too</i> well </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 1:25; Is. 24:5; Jer. 7:23, 24">⚓</a><font color="red">you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">For Moses said, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:12; Deut. 5:16; Matt. 15:4">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 21:17; Lev. 20:9; Prov. 20:20">⚓</a><font color="red">‘He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">But you say, ‘If a man says to his father or mother, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:5; 23:18">⚓</a><font color="red">“Whatever profit you might have received from me <i>is</i> Corban”—’ (that is, a gift <i>to God</i>),</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">then you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">making the word of God of no effect through your tradition which you have handed down. And many such things you do.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:10">⚓</a>When He had called all the multitude to <i>Himself,</i> He said to them, <font color="red">“Hear Me, everyone, and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:9, 11, 12">⚓</a><font color="red">understand:</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">There is nothing that enters a man from outside which can defile him; but the things which come out of him, those are the things that </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 59:3; (Heb. 12:15)">⚓</a><font color="red">defile a man.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:15">⚓</a><font color="red">If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:15">⚓</a>When He had entered a house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him concerning the parable. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_18"><sup>18</sup>So He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 28:9–11; 1 Cor. 3:2; Heb. 5:11–14)">⚓</a><font color="red">“Are you thus without understanding also? Do you not perceive that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">because it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and is eliminated, <i>thus</i> purifying all foods?”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_20"><sup>20</sup>And He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 39:1; (Matt. 12:34–37; James 3:6)">⚓</a><font color="red">“What comes out of a man, that defiles a man.</font></span>

<span class="verse mac_7_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">thefts, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 12:15">⚓</a><font color="red">covetousness, wickedness, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:28, 29">⚓</a><font color="red">deceit, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Pet. 4:3">⚓</a><font color="red">lewdness, an evil eye, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 2:9">⚓</a><font color="red">blasphemy, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 John 2:16">⚓</a><font color="red">pride, foolishness.</font></span>

<span class="verse mac_7_24"> <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:21">⚓</a>From there He arose and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And He entered a house and wanted no one to know <i>it,</i> but He could not be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 2:1, 2">⚓</a>hidden. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_25"><sup>25</sup>For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him, and she came and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:22; John 11:32; Rev. 1:17">⚓</a>fell at His feet. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_26"><sup>26</sup>The woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by birth, and she kept asking Him to cast the demon out of her daughter. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_27"><sup>27</sup>But Jesus said to her, <font color="red">“Let the children be filled first, for it is not good to take the children’s bread and throw <i>it</i> to the little dogs.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_28"> <sup>28</sup>And she answered and said to Him, “Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs under the table eat from the children’s crumbs.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then He said to her, <font color="red">“For this saying go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_7_30"> <sup>30</sup>And when she had come to her house, she found the demon gone out, and her daughter lying on the bed.<br/></span>

<span class="verse mac_7_32"><sup>32</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:32; Luke 11:14">⚓</a>they brought to Him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they begged Him to put His hand on him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_33"><sup>33</sup>And He took him aside from the multitude, and put His fingers in his ears, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 8:23; John 9:6">⚓</a>He spat and touched his tongue. </span>
<span class="verse mac_7_34"><sup>34</sup>Then, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:41; John 11:41; 17:1">⚓</a>looking up to heaven, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:33, 38">⚓</a>He sighed, and said to him, <font color="red">“Ephphatha,”</font> that is, <font color="red">“Be opened.”</font><br/></span>
