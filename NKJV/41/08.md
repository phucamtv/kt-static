<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>Feeding the Four Thousand</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>In those days, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:32–39; Mark 6:34–44; Luke 9:12">⚓</a>the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples <i>to</i> <i>Him</i> and said to them, </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">“I have </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:36; 14:14; Mark 1:41; 6:34">⚓</a><font color="red">compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">And if I send them away hungry to their own houses, they will faint on the way; for some of them have come from afar.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then His disciples answered Him, “How can one satisfy these people with bread here in the wilderness?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:34; Mark 6:38; John 6:9">⚓</a>He asked them, <font color="red">“How many loaves do you have?”</font><br/> And they said, “Seven.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_6"> <sup>6</sup>So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks, broke <i>them</i> and gave <i>them</i> to His disciples to set before <i>them;</i> and they set <i>them</i> before the multitude. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_7"><sup>7</sup>They also had a few small fish; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:19; Mark 6:41">⚓</a>having blessed them, He said to set them also before <i>them.</i></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_8"><sup>8</sup>So they ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets of leftover fragments. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_9"><sup>9</sup>Now those who had eaten were about four thousand. And He sent them away, </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:39">⚓</a>immediately got into the boat with His disciples, and came to the region of Dalmanutha.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Pharisees Seek a Sign</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_8_11"> <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:38; 16:1; Luke 11:16; John 2:18; 6:30; 1 Cor. 1:22">⚓</a>Then the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, testing Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_12"><sup>12</sup>But He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:34">⚓</a>sighed deeply in His spirit, and said, <font color="red">“Why does this generation seek a sign? Assuredly, I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:39">⚓</a><font color="red">no sign shall be given to this generation.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Beware of the Leaven of the Pharisees and Herod</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_8_13"> <sup>13</sup>And He left them, and getting into the boat again, departed to the other side. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:5">⚓</a>Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, and they did not have more than one loaf with them in the boat. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:6; Luke 12:1">⚓</a>Then He charged them, saying, <font color="red">“Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_16"> <sup>16</sup>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “<i>It</i> <i>is</i> because we have no bread.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_17"> <sup>17</sup>But Jesus, being aware of <i>it,</i> said to them, <font color="red">“Why do you reason because you have no bread? </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:52; 16:14">⚓</a><font color="red">Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Is your heart still hardened?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:20; Mark 6:43; Luke 9:17; John 6:13">⚓</a><font color="red">When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up?”</font><br/> They said to Him, “Twelve.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_20"> <sup>20</sup><font color="red">“Also, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:37">⚓</a><font color="red">when I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many large baskets full of fragments did you take up?”</font><br/> And they said, “Seven.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_21"> <sup>21</sup>So He said to them, <font color="red">“How <i>is it</i></font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mark 6:52)">⚓</a><font color="red">you do not understand?”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Blind Man Healed at Bethsaida</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_8_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:27; John 9:1">⚓</a>blind man to Him, and begged Him to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 18:15">⚓</a>touch him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_23"><sup>23</sup>So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:33">⚓</a>He had spit on his eyes and put His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_24"> <sup>24</sup>And he looked up and said, “I see men like trees, walking.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then He put <i>His</i> hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_26"><sup>26</sup>Then He sent him away to his house, saying, <font color="red">“Neither go into the town, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:4; Mark 5:43; 7:36">⚓</a><font color="red">nor tell anyone in the town.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter Confesses Jesus as the Christ</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_8_27"> <sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:13–16; Luke 9:18–20">⚓</a>Now Jesus and His disciples went out to the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on the road He asked His disciples, saying to them, <font color="red">“Who do men say that I am?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_28"> <sup>28</sup>So they answered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:2">⚓</a>“John the Baptist; but some <i>say,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:14, 15; Luke 9:7, 8">⚓</a>Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_29"> <sup>29</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“But who do you say that I am?”</font><br/> Peter answered and said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:41; 4:42; 6:69; 11:27; Acts 2:36; 8:37; 9:20">⚓</a>“You are the Christ.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_30"> <sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:4; 16:20; Luke 9:21">⚓</a>Then He strictly warned them that they should tell no one about Him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_8_31"> <sup>31</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 53:3–11); Matt. 16:21; 20:19; Luke 18:31–33; 1 Pet. 1:11">⚓</a>He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 10:33">⚓</a>rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 9:31; 10:34">⚓</a>killed, and after three days rise again. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_32"><sup>32</sup>He spoke this word openly. Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_8_33"><sup>33</sup>But when He had turned around and looked at His disciples, He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:14; (Rev. 3:19)">⚓</a>rebuked Peter, saying, <font color="red">“Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Take Up the Cross and Follow Him</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_8_34"> <sup>34</sup>When He had called the people to <i>Himself,</i> with His disciples also, He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 10:38); Luke 14:27">⚓</a><font color="red">“Whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">For </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:39; Luke 17:33; John 12:25">⚓</a><font color="red">whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel’s will save it.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_8_38"><sup>38</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:33; Luke 9:26; 12:9">⚓</a><font color="red">For whoever </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:16; 2 Tim. 1:8, 9; 2:12">⚓</a><font color="red">is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him the Son of Man also will be ashamed when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.”</font><br/></span>
