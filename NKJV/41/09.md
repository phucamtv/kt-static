<span class="verse mac_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>And He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:28; Mark 13:26; Luke 9:27; Acts 7:55, 56; Rev. 20:4">⚓</a><font color="red">“Assuredly, I say to you that there are some standing here who will not taste death till they see </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 24:30)">⚓</a><font color="red">the kingdom of God present with power.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Transfigured on the Mount</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_9_2"> <sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:1–8; Luke 9:28–36">⚓</a>Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up on a high mountain apart by themselves; and He was transfigured before them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_3"><sup>3</sup>His clothes became shining, exceedingly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:9; Matt. 28:3">⚓</a>white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth can whiten them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_4"><sup>4</sup>And Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_5"><sup>5</sup>Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah”— </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_6"><sup>6</sup>because he did not know what to say, for they were greatly afraid.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_7"> <sup>7</sup>And a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 40:34; 1 Kin. 8:10; Acts 1:9; Rev. 1:7">⚓</a>cloud came and overshadowed them; and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:7; (Is. 42:1); Matt. 3:17; Mark 1:11; Luke 1:35; 3:22; 2 Pet. 1:17">⚓</a>My beloved Son. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:22">⚓</a>Hear Him!” </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_8"><sup>8</sup>Suddenly, when they had looked around, they saw no one anymore, but only Jesus with themselves.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:9–13; Mark 16:6; Luke 24:6, 7, 46">⚓</a>Now as they came down from the mountain, He commanded them that they should tell no one the things they had seen, till the Son of Man had risen from the dead. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_10"><sup>10</sup>So they kept this word to themselves, questioning <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 2:19–22">⚓</a>what the rising from the dead meant.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_11"> <sup>11</sup>And they asked Him, saying, “Why do the scribes say <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 4:5; Matt. 17:10">⚓</a>that Elijah must come first?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then He answered and told them, <font color="red">“Indeed, Elijah is coming first and restores all things. And </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:6; Is. 53:3; Dan. 9:26">⚓</a><font color="red">how is it written concerning the Son of Man, that He must suffer many things and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:11; Phil. 2:7">⚓</a><font color="red">be treated with contempt?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">But I say to you that </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 4:5; Matt. 11:14; 17:12; Luke 1:17">⚓</a><font color="red">Elijah has also come, and they did to him whatever they wished, as it is written of him.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Boy Is Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_9_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:14–19; Luke 9:37–42">⚓</a>And when He came to the disciples, He saw a great multitude around them, and scribes disputing with them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_15"><sup>15</sup>Immediately, when they saw Him, all the people were greatly amazed, and running to <i>Him,</i> greeted Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_16"><sup>16</sup>And He asked the scribes, <font color="red">“What are you discussing with them?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:14; Luke 9:38">⚓</a>one of the crowd answered and said, “Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a mute spirit. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_18"><sup>18</sup>And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid. So I spoke to Your disciples, that they should cast it out, but they could not.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_19"> <sup>19</sup>He answered him and said, <font color="red">“O </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:48">⚓</a><font color="red">faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_20"><sup>20</sup>Then they brought him to Him. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:26; Luke 9:42">⚓</a>when he saw Him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming at the mouth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_21"> <sup>21</sup>So He asked his father, <font color="red">“How long has this been happening to him?”</font><br/> And he said, “From childhood. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_22"><sup>22</sup>And often he has thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_23"> <sup>23</sup>Jesus said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:20; Mark 11:23; Luke 17:6; John 11:40">⚓</a><font color="red">“If you can believe, all things <i>are</i> possible to him who believes.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_24"> <sup>24</sup>Immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, “Lord, I believe; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 17:5">⚓</a>help my unbelief!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_25"> <sup>25</sup>When Jesus saw that the people came running together, He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:25">⚓</a>rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it: <font color="red">“Deaf and dumb spirit, I command you, come out of him and enter him no more!”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_26"><sup>26</sup>Then <i>the</i> <i>spirit</i> cried out, convulsed him greatly, and came out of him. And he became as one dead, so that many said, “He is dead.” </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_27"><sup>27</sup>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_28"> <sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:19">⚓</a>And when He had come into the house, His disciples asked Him privately, “Why could we not cast it out?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_29"> <sup>29</sup>So He said to them, <font color="red">“This kind can come out by nothing but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(James 5:16)">⚓</a><font color="red">prayer and fasting.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Again Predicts His Death and Resurrection</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_9_30"> <sup>30</sup>Then they departed from there and passed through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_31"><sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:22; Luke 9:44">⚓</a>For He taught His disciples and said to them, <font color="red">“The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men, and they will </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:21; 27:50; Luke 18:33; 23:46; Acts 2:23">⚓</a><font color="red">kill Him.

<span class="verse mac_9_32"><sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:50; 18:34; John 12:16">⚓</a>But they did not understand this saying, and were afraid to ask Him.<br/></span>

And when He was in the house He asked them, <font color="red">“What was it you disputed among yourselves on the road?”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_34"><sup>34</sup>But they kept silent, for on the road they had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 13:10); Mark 15:20, 31">⚓</a>disputed among themselves who <i>would</i> <i>be</i> <i>the</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:4; (Mark 9:50); 14:65; 15:15, 37; Luke 22:24; 23:46; 24:46">⚓</a>greatest. </span>
<span class="verse mac_9_35"><sup>35</sup>And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:26, 27; 23:11; Mark 10:43, 44; Luke 22:26, 27">⚓</a><font color="red">“If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_36"><sup>36</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 10:13–16">⚓</a>He took a little child and set him in the midst of them. And when He had taken him in His arms, He said to them, </span>

<span class="verse mac_9_38"> <sup>38</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:27–29; Luke 9:49">⚓</a>Now John answered Him, saying, “Teacher, we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_9_39"> <sup>39</sup>But Jesus said, <font color="red">“Do not forbid him, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 12:3">⚓</a><font color="red">for no one who works a miracle in My name can soon afterward speak evil of Me.</font></span>
