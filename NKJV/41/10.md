And multitudes gathered to Him again, and as He was accustomed, He taught them again.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_2"> <sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:3">⚓</a>The Pharisees came and asked Him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce <i>his</i> wife?” testing Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_3"> <sup>3</sup>And He answered and said to them, <font color="red">“What did Moses command you?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_4"> <sup>4</sup>They said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 24:1–4; Matt. 5:31; 19:7">⚓</a>“Moses permitted <i>a</i> <i>man</i> to write a certificate of divorce, and to dismiss <i>her.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_5"> <sup>5</sup>And Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">But from the beginning of the creation, God </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:27; 5:2">⚓</a><font color="red">‘made them male and female.’</font></span>

<span class="verse mac_10_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_10"> <sup>10</sup>In the house His disciples also asked Him again about the same <i>matter.</i></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_11"><sup>11</sup>So He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:14; (Matt. 5:32; 19:9); Luke 16:18; (Rom. 7:3); 1 Cor. 7:10, 11">⚓</a><font color="red">“Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.</font></span>

<span class="verse mac_10_14"><sup>14</sup>But when Jesus saw <i>it,</i> He was greatly displeased and said to them, <font color="red">“Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 14:20; 1 Pet. 2:2)">⚓</a><font color="red">of such is the kingdom of God.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">Assuredly, I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:3, 4; 19:14; Luke 18:17">⚓</a><font color="red">whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 13:28">⚓</a><font color="red">by no means enter it.”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_16"><sup>16</sup>And He took them up in His arms, laid <i>His</i> hands on them, and blessed them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Counsels the Rich Young Ruler</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_10_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:16–30; Luke 18:18–30">⚓</a>Now as He was going out on the road, one came running, knelt before Him, and asked Him, “Good Teacher, what shall I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 6:28; Acts 2:37">⚓</a>do that I may inherit eternal life?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_18"> <sup>18</sup>So Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Why do you call Me good? No one <i>is</i> good but One, <i>that is,</i></font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:2">⚓</a><font color="red">God.</font></span>

<span class="verse mac_10_20"> <sup>20</sup>And he answered and said to Him, “Teacher, all these things I have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 3:6">⚓</a>kept from my youth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, <font color="red">“One thing you lack: Go your way, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 12:33; 16:9)">⚓</a><font color="red">sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 6:19, 20; 19:21">⚓</a><font color="red">treasure in heaven; and come, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mark 8:34)">⚓</a><font color="red">take up the cross, and follow Me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_22"> <sup>22</sup>But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.<br/></span>

<span class="verse mac_10_24"><sup>24</sup>And the disciples were astonished at His words. But Jesus answered again and said to them, <font color="red">“Children, how hard it is for those </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 31:24; Ps. 52:7; 62:10; (Prov. 11:28; 1 Tim. 6:17)">⚓</a><font color="red">who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God!</font></span>

<span class="verse mac_10_26"> <sup>26</sup>And they were greatly astonished, saying among themselves, “Who then can be saved?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_27"> <sup>27</sup>But Jesus looked at them and said, <font color="red">“With men <i>it is</i> impossible, but not </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 42:2; Jer. 32:17; Matt. 19:26; Luke 1:37">⚓</a><font color="red">with God; for with God all things are possible.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_28"> <sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:27; Luke 18:28">⚓</a>Then Peter began to say to Him, “See, we have left all and followed You.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_29"> <sup>29</sup>So Jesus answered and said, <font color="red">“Assuredly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My sake and the gospel’s,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 25:9; Luke 18:29, 30">⚓</a><font color="red">who shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 3:3; 2 Tim. 3:12; (1 Pet. 4:12, 13)">⚓</a><font color="red">persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life.</font></span>

<div class="title"><h3>Greatness Is Serving</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_10_35"> <sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(James 4:3)">⚓</a>Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Him, saying, “Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_36"> <sup>36</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“What do you want Me to do for you?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_10_37"> <sup>37</sup>They said to Him, “Grant us that we may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left, in Your glory.”<br/></span>
