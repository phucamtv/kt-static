<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>The Triumphal Entry</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:1–9; Luke 19:29; John 2:13">⚓</a>when they drew near Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples; </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_2"><sup>2</sup>and He said to them, <font color="red">“Go into the village opposite you; and as soon as you have entered it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has sat. Loose it and bring <i>it.</i></font></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">And if anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it,’ and immediately he will send it here.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_4"> <sup>4</sup>So they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door outside on the street, and they loosed it. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_5"><sup>5</sup>But some of those who stood there said to them, “What are you doing, loosing the colt?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_6"> <sup>6</sup>And they spoke to them just as Jesus had commanded. So they let them go. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_7"><sup>7</sup>Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes on it, and He sat on it. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:8">⚓</a>And many spread their clothes on the road, and others cut down leafy branches from the trees and spread <i>them</i> on the road. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_9"><sup>9</sup>Then those who went before and those who followed cried out, saying:<br/>  “Hosanna!<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 118:25, 26; Matt. 21:9">⚓</a>‘Blessed <i>is</i> He who comes in the name of the LORD!’<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_10">   <sup>10</sup>Blessed <i>is</i> the kingdom of our father David<br/>   That comes in the name of the Lord!<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 148:1">⚓</a>Hosanna in the highest!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_11"> <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:12">⚓</a>And Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. So when He had looked around at all things, as the hour was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Fig Tree Withered</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_11_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:18–22">⚓</a>Now the next day, when they had come out from Bethany, He was hungry. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:19">⚓</a>And seeing from afar a fig tree having leaves, He went to see if perhaps He would find something on it. When He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_14"><sup>14</sup>In response Jesus said to it, <font color="red">“Let no one eat fruit from you ever again.”</font><br/> And His disciples heard <i>it.</i><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_11_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 3:1; Matt. 21:12–16; Luke 19:45–47; John 2:13–16">⚓</a>So they came to Jerusalem. Then Jesus went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 14:22">⚓</a>doves. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_16"><sup>16</sup>And He would not allow anyone to carry wares through the temple. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_17"><sup>17</sup>Then He taught, saying to them, <font color="red">“Is it not written, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 56:7">⚓</a><font color="red">‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations’? But you have made it a </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:11">⚓</a><font color="red">‘den of thieves.’”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_18"> <sup>18</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:2; Matt. 21:45, 46; Luke 19:47">⚓</a>the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy Him; for they feared Him, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 7:28; Mark 1:22; 6:2; Luke 4:32">⚓</a>all the people were astonished at His teaching. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_19"><sup>19</sup>When evening had come, He went out of the city.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Lesson of the Withered Fig Tree</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_11_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:19–22">⚓</a>Now in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_21"><sup>21</sup>And Peter, remembering, said to Him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which You cursed has withered away.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_22"> <sup>22</sup>So Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Have faith in God.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">For </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:20; 21:21; Luke 17:6">⚓</a><font color="red">assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">Therefore I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 7:7; Luke 11:9; (John 14:13; 15:7; 16:24; James 1:5, 6)">⚓</a><font color="red">whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive <i>them,</i> and you will have <i>them.</i></font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Forgiveness and Prayer</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_11_25"> <sup>25</sup><font color="red">“And whenever you stand praying, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 6:14; 18:23–35; Eph. 4:32; (Col. 3:13)">⚓</a><font color="red">if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">But </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 6:15; 18:35">⚓</a><font color="red">if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus’ Authority Questioned</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_11_27"> <sup>27</sup>Then they came again to Jerusalem. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:23–27; Luke 20:1–8">⚓</a>And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_28"><sup>28</sup>And they said to Him, “By what <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 5:27">⚓</a>authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority to do these things?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_29"> <sup>29</sup>But Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“I also will ask you one question; then answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">The </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mark 1:4, 5, 8); Luke 7:29, 30">⚓</a><font color="red">baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men? Answer Me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_11_31"> <sup>31</sup>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_32"><sup>32</sup>But if we say, ‘From men’ ”—they feared the people, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:5; 14:5; Mark 6:20">⚓</a>all counted John to have been a prophet indeed. </span>
<span class="verse mac_11_33"><sup>33</sup>So they answered and said to Jesus, “We do not know.”<br/> And Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”</font><br/></span>
