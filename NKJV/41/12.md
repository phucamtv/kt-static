<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>The Parable of the Wicked Vinedressers</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:33–46; Luke 20:9–19">⚓</a>He began to speak to them in parables: <font color="red">“A man planted a vineyard and set a hedge around <i>it,</i> dug <i>a place for</i> the wine vat and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">Now at vintage-time he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that he might receive some of the fruit of the vineyard from the vinedressers.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">And they took <i>him</i> and beat him and sent <i>him</i> away empty-handed.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">Again he sent them another servant, and at him they threw stones, wounded <i>him</i> in the head, and sent <i>him</i> away shamefully treated.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">And again he sent another, and him they killed; and many others, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 36:16">⚓</a><font color="red">beating some and killing some.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">Therefore still having one son, his beloved, he also sent him to them last, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">But those vinedressers said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">So they took him and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 2:23)">⚓</a><font color="red">killed <i>him</i> and cast <i>him</i> out of the vineyard.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_9"> <sup>9</sup><font color="red">“Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vinedressers, and give the vineyard to others. </font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_10"><sup>10</sup>Have you not even read this Scripture:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 118:22, 23">⚓</a><font color="red">‘The stone which the builders rejected</font><br/>   <font color="red">Has become the chief cornerstone.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_11">   <sup>11</sup><font color="red">This was the </font>LORD<font color="red">’s doing,</font><br/>   <font color="red">And it is marvelous in our eyes’?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:45, 46; Mark 11:18; John 7:25, 30, 44">⚓</a>And they sought to lay hands on Him, but feared the multitude, for they knew He had spoken the parable against them. So they left Him and went away.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Pharisees: Is It Lawful to Pay Taxes to Caesar?</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:15–22; Luke 20:20–26">⚓</a>Then they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch Him in <i>His</i> words. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_14"><sup>14</sup>When they had come, they said to Him, “Teacher, we know that You are true, and care about no one; for You do not regard the person of men, but teach the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:26">⚓</a>way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_15"><sup>15</sup>Shall we pay, or shall we not pay?”<br/> But He, knowing their <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 23:28; Luke 12:1">⚓</a>hypocrisy, said to them, <font color="red">“Why do you test Me? Bring Me a denarius that I may see <i>it.</i>”</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_16"><sup>16</sup>So they brought <i>it.</i><br/> And He said to them, <font color="red">“Whose image and inscription <i>is</i> this?”</font> They said to Him, “Caesar’s.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_17"> <sup>17</sup>And Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eccl. 5:4, 5)">⚓</a><font color="red">God the things that are God’s.”</font><br/> And they marveled at Him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Sadducees: What About the Resurrection?</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:23–33; Luke 20:27–38">⚓</a>Then <i>some</i> Sadducees, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:8">⚓</a>who say there is no resurrection, came to Him; and they asked Him, saying: </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_19"><sup>19</sup>“Teacher, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 25:5">⚓</a>Moses wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies, and leaves <i>his</i> wife behind, and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_20"><sup>20</sup>Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife; and dying, he left no offspring. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_21"><sup>21</sup>And the second took her, and he died; nor did he leave any offspring. And the third likewise. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_22"><sup>22</sup>So the seven had her and left no offspring. Last of all the woman died also. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_23"><sup>23</sup>Therefore, in the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_24"> <sup>24</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Are you not therefore mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 15:42, 49, 52)">⚓</a><font color="red">are like angels in heaven.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">But concerning the dead, that they </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 5:25, 28, 29); Acts 26:8; Rom. 4:17; (Rev. 20:12, 13)">⚓</a><font color="red">rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the <i>burning</i> bush <i>passage,</i> how God spoke to him, saying, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:6, 15">⚓</a><font color="red">‘I<i>am</i>the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. You are therefore greatly mistaken.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Scribes: Which Is the First Commandment of All?</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_28"> <sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:34–40; Luke 10:25–28; 20:39">⚓</a>Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, “Which is the first commandment of all?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_29"> <sup>29</sup>Jesus answered him, <font color="red">“The first of all the commandments <i>is:</i></font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:4, 5; Is. 44:8; 45:22; 46:9; 1 Cor. 8:6">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is one.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">And you shall </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 10:12; 30:6); Luke 10:27">⚓</a><font color="red">love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’This <i>is</i> the first commandment.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">And the second, like <i>it, is</i> this: </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:18; Matt. 22:39; Gal. 5:14; James 2:8">⚓</a><font color="red">‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 13:9)">⚓</a><font color="red">these.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_32"> <sup>32</sup>So the scribe said to Him, “Well <i>said,</i> Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:39; Is. 45:6, 14; 46:9; (John 1:14, 17; 14:6)">⚓</a>and there is no other but He. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_33"><sup>33</sup>And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Sam. 15:22; Hos. 6:6; Mic. 6:6–8; Matt. 9:13; 12:7)">⚓</a>is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_34"> <sup>34</sup>Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, <font color="red">“You are not far from the kingdom of God.”</font><br/> <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:46">⚓</a>But after that no one dared question Him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus: How Can David Call His Descendant Lord?</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_35"> <sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:41–46; Luke 20:41–44">⚓</a>Then Jesus answered and said, while He taught in the temple, <font color="red">“How <i>is it</i> that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">For David himself said </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 23:2">⚓</a><font color="red">by the Holy Spirit:</font><br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 110:1">⚓</a><font color="red">‘The </font>LORD<font color="red"> said to my Lord,</font><br/>   <font color="red">“Sit at My right hand,</font><br/>   <font color="red">Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.” ’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_37"> <sup>37</sup><font color="red">Therefore David himself calls Him ‘Lord’; how is He <i>then</i> his </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 2:29–31)">⚓</a><font color="red">Son?”</font><br/> And the common people heard Him gladly.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Beware of the Scribes</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_38"> <sup>38</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 4:2">⚓</a>He said to them in His teaching, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 23:1–7; Luke 20:45–47">⚓</a><font color="red">“Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 23:7; Luke 11:43">⚓</a><font color="red"><i>love</i> greetings in the marketplaces,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">the </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 14:7">⚓</a><font color="red">best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts,</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_40"><sup>40</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 23:14">⚓</a><font color="red">who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Widow’s Two Mites</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_12_41"> <sup>41</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 21:1–4">⚓</a>Now Jesus sat opposite the treasury and saw how the people put money <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 12:9">⚓</a>into the treasury. And many <i>who</i> <i>were</i> rich put in much. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_42"><sup>42</sup>Then one poor widow came and threw in two mites, which make a quadrans. </span>
<span class="verse mac_12_43"><sup>43</sup>So He called His disciples to <i>Himself</i> and said to them, <font color="red">“Assuredly, I say to you that </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 8:12)">⚓</a><font color="red">this poor widow has put in more than all those who have given to the treasury;</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_12_44"><sup>44</sup><font color="red">for they all put in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all that she had, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 24:6; (1 John 3:17)">⚓</a><font color="red">her whole livelihood.”</font><br/></span>
