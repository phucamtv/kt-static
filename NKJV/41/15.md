<span class="verse mac_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>Immediately, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:2; Matt. 27:1; Luke 22:66; 23:1; John 18:28; Acts 3:13; 4:26">⚓</a>in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council; and they bound Jesus, led <i>Him</i> away, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 18:32; Acts 3:13">⚓</a>delivered <i>Him</i> to Pilate. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:11–14; Luke 23:2, 3; John 18:29–38">⚓</a>Then Pilate asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?”<br/> He answered and said to him, <font color="red">“<i>It is as</i> you say.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_15_3"> <sup>3</sup>And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:7; John 19:9; Acts 8:32">⚓</a>answered nothing. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:13">⚓</a>Then Pilate asked Him again, saying, “Do You answer nothing? See how many things they testify against You!” </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 38:13, 14; Is. 53:7; John 19:9">⚓</a>But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Taking the Place of Barabbas</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_15_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:15–26; Luke 23:18–25; John 18:39—19:16">⚓</a>at the feast he was accustomed to releasing one prisoner to them, whomever they requested. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_7"><sup>7</sup>And there was one named Barabbas, <i>who</i> <i>was</i> chained with his fellow rebels; they had committed murder in the rebellion. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_8"><sup>8</sup>Then the multitude, crying aloud, began to ask <i>him</i> <i>to</i> <i>do</i> just as he had always done for them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_9"><sup>9</sup>But Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_10"><sup>10</sup>For he knew that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_15_11"> <sup>11</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:20; Acts 3:14">⚓</a>the chief priests stirred up the crowd, so that he should rather release Barabbas to them. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_12"><sup>12</sup>Pilate answered and said to them again, “What then do you want me to do <i>with</i> <i>Him</i> whom you call the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:6; (Is. 9:7); Jer. 23:5; 33:15; Mic. 5:2">⚓</a>King of the Jews?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_15_13"> <sup>13</sup>So they cried out again, “Crucify Him!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_15_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then Pilate said to them, “Why, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:9; John 8:46; 1 Pet. 2:21–23">⚓</a>what evil has He done?”<br/> But they cried out all the more, “Crucify Him!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_15_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 50:6; Matt. 27:26; Mark 10:34; John 19:1, 16">⚓</a>So Pilate, wanting to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged <i>Him,</i> to be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 53:8)">⚓</a>crucified.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Soldiers Mock Jesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_15_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:27–31">⚓</a>Then the soldiers led Him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they called together the whole garrison. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_17"><sup>17</sup>And they clothed Him with purple; and they twisted a crown of thorns, put it on His <i>head,</i></span>
<span class="verse mac_15_18"><sup>18</sup>and began to salute Him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_19"><sup>19</sup>Then they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 50:6; 52:14; 53:5); Mic. 5:1; Mark 14:65">⚓</a>struck Him on the head with a reed and spat on Him; and bowing the knee, they worshiped Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_20"><sup>20</sup>And when they had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 35:16; 69:19; Is. 53:3; Matt. 20:19; Mark 10:34; Luke 22:63; 23:11">⚓</a>mocked Him, they took the purple off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The King on a Cross</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_15_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:32; Luke 23:26">⚓</a>Then they compelled a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to bear His cross. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:33–44; Luke 23:33–43; John 19:17–24; Heb. 13:12">⚓</a>And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:21; Matt. 27:34">⚓</a>Then they gave Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He did not take <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse mac_15_24"><sup>24</sup>And when they crucified Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:18; Luke 23:34; John 19:23">⚓</a>they divided His garments, casting lots for them <i>to</i> <i>determine</i> what every man should take.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_15_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:45; Luke 23:44; John 19:14">⚓</a>it was the third hour, and they crucified Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_26"><sup>26</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:37; John 19:19">⚓</a>the inscription of His accusation was written above:<br/> <aside style="text-align:center;">THE KING OF THE JEWS.</aside><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_15_27"> <sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:9, 12; Matt. 27:38; Luke 22:37">⚓</a>With Him they also crucified two robbers, one on His right and the other on His left. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_28"><sup>28</sup>So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:12; Luke 22:37">⚓</a>“And He was numbered with the transgressors.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_15_29"> <sup>29</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:6, 7; 69:7">⚓</a>those who passed by blasphemed Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 109:25">⚓</a>wagging their heads and saying, “Aha! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 14:58; John 2:19–21">⚓</a><i>You</i> who destroy the temple and build <i>it</i> in three days, </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_30"><sup>30</sup>save Yourself, and come down from the cross!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_15_31"> <sup>31</sup>Likewise the chief priests also, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 18:32">⚓</a>mocking among themselves with the scribes, said, “He saved <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:14, 15; John 11:43, 44">⚓</a>others; Himself He cannot save. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_32"><sup>32</sup>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe.”<br/> Even <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 8:9; Matt. 27:44; Luke 23:39">⚓</a>those who were crucified with Him reviled Him.<br/></span>

<span class="verse mac_15_34"><sup>34</sup>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, <font color="red">“Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?”</font> which is translated, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:1; Matt. 27:46">⚓</a><font color="red">“My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_15_35"> <sup>35</sup>Some of those who stood by, when they heard <i>that,</i> said, “Look, He is calling for Elijah!” </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_36"><sup>36</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:48; John 19:29">⚓</a>someone ran and filled a sponge full of sour wine, put <i>it</i> on a reed, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:21">⚓</a>offered <i>it</i> to Him to drink, saying, “Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to take Him down.”<br/></span>

<span class="verse mac_15_43"><sup>43</sup>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:57; Luke 2:25, 38; 23:51; John 19:38">⚓</a>was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_44"><sup>44</sup>Pilate marveled that He was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if He had been dead for some time. </span>
<span class="verse mac_15_45"><sup>45</sup>So when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. </span>
