<span class="verse mac_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:1–8; Luke 24:1–10; John 20:1–8">⚓</a>when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary <i>the</i> <i>mother</i> of James, and Salome <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:56; John 19:39">⚓</a>bought spices, that they might come and anoint Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_16_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:1; John 20:1">⚓</a>Very early in the morning, on the first <i>day</i> of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. </span>
<span class="verse mac_16_3"><sup>3</sup>And they said among themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?” </span>
<span class="verse mac_16_4"><sup>4</sup>But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away—for it was very large. </span>
<span class="verse mac_16_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:3; John 20:11, 12">⚓</a>And entering the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_16_6"> <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 16:10; 49:15; Hos. 6:2; Matt. 28:6; Mark 9:31; Luke 24:6">⚓</a>But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid Him. </span>
<span class="verse mac_16_7"><sup>7</sup>But go, tell His disciples—and Peter—that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:32; 28:16, 17; Mark 14:28">⚓</a>as He said to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse mac_16_8"> <sup>8</sup>So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb, for they trembled and were amazed. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:8">⚓</a>And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Mary Magdalene Sees the Risen Lord</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_16_9"> <sup>9</sup>Now when <i>He</i> rose early on the first <i>day</i> of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 8:2">⚓</a>out of whom He had cast seven demons. </span>
<span class="verse mac_16_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:10">⚓</a>She went and told those who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept. </span>
<span class="verse mac_16_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:17; Luke 24:11, 41; John 20:25">⚓</a>And when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Appears to Two Disciples</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_16_12"> <sup>12</sup>After that, He appeared in another form <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:13–35">⚓</a>to two of them as they walked and went into the country. </span>
<span class="verse mac_16_13"><sup>13</sup>And they went and told <i>it</i> to the rest, <i>but</i> they did not believe them either.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Great Commission</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_16_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:36; John 20:19, 26; 1 Cor. 15:5">⚓</a>Later He appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table; and He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen. </span>
<span class="verse mac_16_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:19; (John 15:16; Acts 1:8); Col. 1:6">⚓</a>And He said to them, <font color="red">“Go into all the world </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Col. 1:23)">⚓</a><font color="red">and preach the gospel to every creature.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_16_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 3:18, 36; Acts 2:38; 16:30, 31; Rom. 10:8–10)">⚓</a><font color="red">He who believes and is baptized will be saved; </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 12:48)">⚓</a><font color="red">but he who does not believe will be condemned.</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_16_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">And these </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:12">⚓</a><font color="red">signs will follow those who believe: </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 9:38; Luke 10:17; Acts 5:16; 8:7; 16:18; 19:12">⚓</a><font color="red">In My name they will cast out demons; </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 2:4; 1 Cor. 12:10)">⚓</a><font color="red">they will speak with new tongues;</font></span>
<span class="verse mac_16_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 10:19); Acts 28:3–6">⚓</a><font color="red">they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 5:15); James 5:14">⚓</a><font color="red">they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Christ Ascends to God’s Right Hand</h3></div>
<span class="verse mac_16_19"> <sup>19</sup>So then, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:2, 3">⚓</a>after the Lord had spoken to them, He was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 68:18; Luke 9:51; 24:51; John 6:62; 20:17; Acts 1:2, 9–11; (1 Tim. 3:16; Rev. 4:2)">⚓</a>received up into heaven, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 110:1); Luke 22:69; (Acts 7:55); 1 Pet. 3:22">⚓</a>sat down at the right hand of God. </span>
<span class="verse mac_16_20"><sup>20</sup>And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with <i>them</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:12; (1 Cor. 2:4, 5; Heb. 2:4)">⚓</a>and confirming the word through the accompanying signs. Amen.<br/></span>
