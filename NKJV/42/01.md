<span class="verse lu_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>Inasmuch as many have taken in hand to set in order a narrative of those <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 20:31">⚓</a>things which have been fulfilled among us, </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_2"><sup>2</sup>just as those who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:1; John 15:27; Acts 1:21, 22">⚓</a>from the beginning were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:2">⚓</a>eyewitnesses and ministers of the word <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:3; 10:39; Heb. 2:3; 1 Pet. 5:1; 2 Pet. 1:16; 1 John 1:1">⚓</a>delivered them to us, </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_3"><sup>3</sup>it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you an orderly account, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:1">⚓</a>most excellent Theophilus, </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 20:31)">⚓</a>that you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>John’s Birth Announced to Zacharias</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_1_5"> <sup>5</sup>There was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 2:1">⚓</a>in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 24:1, 10">⚓</a>of the division of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 12:4">⚓</a>Abijah. His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 21:13, 14">⚓</a>wife <i>was</i> of the daughters of Aaron, and her name <i>was</i> Elizabeth. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_6"><sup>6</sup>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_7"><sup>7</sup>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_1_8"> <sup>8</sup>So it was, that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division, </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_9"><sup>9</sup>according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot fell <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:7, 8; 1 Chr. 23:13; 2 Chr. 29:11">⚓</a>to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 16:17">⚓</a>And the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_11"><sup>11</sup>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:1">⚓</a>the altar of incense. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_12"><sup>12</sup>And when Zacharias saw <i>him,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:22; Dan. 10:8; Luke 2:9; Acts 10:4; Rev. 1:17">⚓</a>he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_1_13"> <sup>13</sup>But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:57, 60, 63">⚓</a>you shall call his name John. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_14"><sup>14</sup>And you will have joy and gladness, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:58">⚓</a>many will rejoice at his birth. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_15"><sup>15</sup>For he will be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 7:24–28)">⚓</a>great in the sight of the Lord, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 6:3; Judg. 13:4; Matt. 11:18">⚓</a>shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:5; Gal. 1:15">⚓</a>even from his mother’s womb. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_16"><sup>16</sup>And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 4:5, 6; Matt. 3:2; 11:14; Mark 1:4; 9:12">⚓</a>He will also go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_1_18"> <sup>18</sup>And Zacharias said to the angel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:17">⚓</a>“How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_1_19"> <sup>19</sup>And the angel answered and said to him, “I am <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 8:16; (Matt. 18:10); Heb. 1:4">⚓</a>Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and was sent to speak to you and bring you these glad <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:10">⚓</a>tidings. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_20"><sup>20</sup>But behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:26; 24:27">⚓</a>you will be mute and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their own time.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_1_21"> <sup>21</sup>And the people waited for Zacharias, and marveled that he lingered so long in the temple. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_22"><sup>22</sup>But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he beckoned to them and remained speechless.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_1_23"> <sup>23</sup>So it was, as soon as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 11:5; 1 Chr. 9:25">⚓</a>the days of his service were completed, that he departed to his own house. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_24"><sup>24</sup>Now after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying, </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_25"><sup>25</sup>“Thus the Lord has dealt with me, in the days when He looked on <i>me,</i> to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 30:23; Is. 4:1; 54:1, 4">⚓</a>take away my reproach among people.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Christ’s Birth Announced to Mary</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_1_26"> <sup>26</sup>Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_27"><sup>27</sup>to a virgin <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:18; Luke 2:4, 5">⚓</a>betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name <i>was</i> Mary. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_28"><sup>28</sup>And having come in, the angel said to her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:23">⚓</a>“Rejoice, highly favored <i>one,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 6:12">⚓</a>the Lord <i>is</i> with you; blessed <i>are</i> you among women!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_1_29"> <sup>29</sup>But when she saw <i>him,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:12">⚓</a>she was troubled at his saying, and considered what manner of greeting this was. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_30"><sup>30</sup>Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:52">⚓</a>favor with God. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_31"><sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 7:14; Matt. 1:21, 25; Gal. 4:4">⚓</a>And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:21; (Phil. 2:9–11)">⚓</a>shall call His name Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_32"><sup>32</sup>He will be great, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:17; 17:5; Mark 5:7; Luke 1:35, 76; 6:35; Acts 7:48">⚓</a>and will be called the Son of the Highest; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:12, 13, 16; Ps. 132:11; (Is. 9:6, 7; 16:5; Jer. 23:5)">⚓</a>the Lord God will give Him the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:14–17; Acts 2:33; 7:55">⚓</a>throne of His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:1">⚓</a>father David. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_33"><sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 2:44; Obad. 21; Mic. 4:7); John 12:34; (Heb. 1:8); 2 Pet. 1:11">⚓</a>And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_1_34"> <sup>34</sup>Then Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I do not know a man?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_1_35"> <sup>35</sup>And the angel answered and said to her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:20">⚓</a>“<i>The</i> Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:7; Matt. 3:17; 14:33; 17:5; Mark 1:1; John 1:34; 20:31; Acts 8:37; (Rom. 1:1–4; Heb. 1:2, 8)">⚓</a>the Son of God. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_36"><sup>36</sup>Now indeed, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for her who was called barren. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_37"><sup>37</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:14; Jer. 32:17; Matt. 19:26; Mark 10:27; Rom. 4:21">⚓</a>with God nothing will be impossible.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_1_38"> <sup>38</sup>Then Mary said, “Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Mary Visits Elizabeth</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_1_39"> <sup>39</sup>Now Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 21:9">⚓</a>to a city of Judah, </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_40"><sup>40</sup>and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_41"><sup>41</sup>And it happened, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:3">⚓</a>filled with the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_42"><sup>42</sup>Then she spoke out with a loud voice and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 5:24">⚓</a>“Blessed <i>are</i> you among women, and blessed <i>is</i> the fruit of your womb! </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_43"><sup>43</sup>But why <i>is</i> this <i>granted</i> to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_44"><sup>44</sup>For indeed, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_45"><sup>45</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 20:29">⚓</a>Blessed <i>is</i> she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of those things which were told her from the Lord.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Song of Mary</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_1_46"> <sup>46</sup>And Mary said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:1–10; Ps. 34:2, 3; Hab. 3:18">⚓</a>“My soul magnifies the Lord,<br/></span>

<span class="verse lu_1_56"> <sup>56</sup>And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Birth of John the Baptist</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_1_57"> <sup>57</sup>Now Elizabeth’s full time came for her to be delivered, and she brought forth a son. </span>

<div class="title"><h3>Circumcision of John the Baptist</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_1_59"> <sup>59</sup>So it was, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:12; Lev. 12:3; Luke 2:21; Phil. 3:5">⚓</a>on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him by the name of his father, Zacharias. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_60"><sup>60</sup>His mother answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:13, 63">⚓</a>“No; he shall be called John.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_1_61"> <sup>61</sup>But they said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.” </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_62"><sup>62</sup>So they made signs to his father—what he would have him called.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_1_63"> <sup>63</sup>And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, “His name is John.” So they all marveled. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_64"><sup>64</sup>Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue <i>loosed,</i> and he spoke, praising God. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_65"><sup>65</sup>Then fear came on all who dwelt around them; and all these sayings were discussed throughout all the hill country of Judea. </span>
<span class="verse lu_1_66"><sup>66</sup>And all those who heard <i>them</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:19">⚓</a>kept <i>them</i> in their hearts, saying, “What kind of child will this be?” And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 39:2; Acts 11:21">⚓</a>the hand of the Lord was with him.<br/></span>
