<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Christ Born of Mary</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>And it came to pass in those days <i>that</i> a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:25; Acts 5:37">⚓</a>This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_3"><sup>3</sup>So all went to be registered, everyone to his own city.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_2_4"> <sup>4</sup>Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:1; Mic. 5:2">⚓</a>the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:16">⚓</a>because he was of the house and lineage of David, </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_5"><sup>5</sup>to be registered with Mary, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 1:18)">⚓</a>his betrothed wife, who was with child. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_6"><sup>6</sup>So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed for her to be delivered. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_7"><sup>7</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:25; Luke 1:31">⚓</a>she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Glory in the Highest</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_2_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_9"><sup>9</sup>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:12">⚓</a>and they were greatly afraid. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_10"><sup>10</sup>Then the angel said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:13, 30">⚓</a>“Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:3; Is. 49:6; (Matt. 28:19; Mark 1:15; Col. 1:23)">⚓</a>which will be to all people. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 9:6">⚓</a>For there is born to you this day in the city of David <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:21; John 4:42; (Acts 5:31)">⚓</a>a Savior, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:16; 16:16, 20; John 11:27; Acts 2:36; Phil. 2:11">⚓</a>who is Christ the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_12"><sup>12</sup>And this <i>will</i> <i>be</i> the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_2_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:12; Ps. 103:20; 148:2; Dan. 7:10; (Heb. 1:14); Rev. 5:11">⚓</a>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_2_14">  <sup>14</sup>“Glory<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:9; Luke 19:38; Eph. 1:6">⚓</a> to God in the highest,<br/>   And on earth <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 57:19; (Rom. 5:1); Eph. 2:17; (Col. 1:20)">⚓</a>peace, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 3:16; Eph. 2:4, 7; 2 Thess. 2:16; 1 John 4:9)">⚓</a>goodwill toward men!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_2_15"> <sup>15</sup>So it was, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, “Let us now go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.” </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_16"><sup>16</sup>And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in a manger. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_17"><sup>17</sup>Now when they had seen <i>Him,</i> they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_18"><sup>18</sup>And all those who heard <i>it</i> marveled at those things which were told them by the shepherds. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 37:11; Luke 1:66">⚓</a>But Mary kept all these things and pondered <i>them</i> in her heart. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_20"><sup>20</sup>Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 19:37">⚓</a>praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Circumcision of Jesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_2_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:12; Lev. 12:3">⚓</a>And when eight days were completed for the circumcision of the Child, His name was called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 1:21)">⚓</a>Jesus, the name given by the angel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:31">⚓</a>before He was conceived in the womb.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Presented in the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_2_22"> <sup>22</sup>Now when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 12:2–8">⚓</a>the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present <i>Him</i> to the Lord </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:12; 22:29; Lev. 27:26; Deut. 18:4; Neh. 10:36">⚓</a>(as it is written in the law of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:2, 12, 15; Num. 3:13; 8:17">⚓</a>“Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the LORD”), </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_24"><sup>24</sup>and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 12:2, 8">⚓</a>“A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Simeon Sees God’s Salvation</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_2_25"> <sup>25</sup>And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name <i>was</i> Simeon, and this man <i>was</i> just and devout, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 40:1; Mark 15:43; Luke 2:38; 23:51">⚓</a>waiting for the Consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_26"><sup>26</sup>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 89:48; (John 8:51; Heb. 11:5)">⚓</a>see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_27"><sup>27</sup>So he came <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:1">⚓</a>by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for Him according to the custom of the law, </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_28"><sup>28</sup>he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_2_29">  <sup>29</sup>“Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 46:30; (Phil. 1:23)">⚓</a>now You are letting Your servant depart in peace,<br/>   According to Your word;<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_2_30">   <sup>30</sup>For my eyes <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 119:166, 174; (Is. 52:10; Luke 3:6)">⚓</a>have seen Your salvation<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_2_31">   <sup>31</sup>Which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,<br/></span>

<span class="verse lu_2_33"> <sup>33</sup>And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things which were spoken of Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_34"><sup>34</sup>Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother, “Behold, this <i>Child</i> is destined for the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 8:14; Hos. 14:9; Matt. 21:44; (Rom. 9:32); 1 Cor. 1:23; (2 Cor. 2:16; 1 Pet. 2:7, 8)">⚓</a>fall and rising of many in Israel, and for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:12–15; Acts 4:2; 17:32; 28:22; (1 Pet. 2:12; 4:14)">⚓</a>a sign which will be spoken against </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_35"><sup>35</sup>(yes, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 42:10; John 19:25">⚓</a>a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Anna Bears Witness to the Redeemer</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_2_36"> <sup>36</sup>Now there was one, Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 19:24">⚓</a>Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity; </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_37"><sup>37</sup>and this woman <i>was</i> a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but served <i>God</i> with fastings and prayers <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 26:7; 1 Tim. 5:5">⚓</a>night and day. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_38"><sup>38</sup>And coming in that instant she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of Him to all those who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lam. 3:25, 26; Mark 15:43; Luke 24:21">⚓</a>looked for redemption in Jerusalem.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Family Returns to Nazareth</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_2_39"> <sup>39</sup>So when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their <i>own</i> city, Nazareth. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_40"><sup>40</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:80; 2:52; (1 Cor. 1:24, 30)">⚓</a>And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Boy Jesus Amazes the Scholars</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_2_41"> <sup>41</sup>His parents went to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:20">⚓</a>Jerusalem <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:15, 17; 34:23; Deut. 16:1, 16; Luke 22:15">⚓</a>every year at the Feast of the Passover. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_42"><sup>42</sup>And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:14, 15">⚓</a>custom of the feast. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_43"><sup>43</sup>When they had finished the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:15">⚓</a>days, as they returned, the Boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know <i>it;</i></span>
<span class="verse lu_2_44"><sup>44</sup>but supposing Him to have been in the company, they went a day’s journey, and sought Him among <i>their</i> relatives and acquaintances. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_45"><sup>45</sup>So when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_46"><sup>46</sup>Now so it was <i>that</i> after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_47"><sup>47</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 7:28; 13:54; 22:33; Mark 1:22; 6:2; 11:18; Luke 4:32; John 7:15">⚓</a>all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_48"><sup>48</sup>So when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, “Son, why have You done this to us? Look, Your father and I have sought You anxiously.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_2_49"> <sup>49</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“Why did you seek Me?

<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Advances in Wisdom and Favor</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_2_51"> <sup>51</sup>Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them, but His mother <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:28">⚓</a>kept all these things in her heart. </span>
<span class="verse lu_2_52"><sup>52</sup>And Jesus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 11:2, 3; Col. 2:2, 3)">⚓</a>increased in wisdom and stature, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:26; (Prov. 3:1–4)">⚓</a>and in favor with God and men.<br/></span>
