<span class="verse lu_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 11:2; 61:1); Matt. 4:1–11; Mark 1:12, 13">⚓</a>Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:12; Luke 2:27">⚓</a>was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_2"><sup>2</sup>being tempted for forty days by the devil. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 34:28; 1 Kin. 19:8">⚓</a>in those days He ate nothing, and afterward, when they had ended, He was hungry.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_3"> <sup>3</sup>And the devil said to Him, “If You are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 3:11; John 20:31">⚓</a>the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_4"> <sup>4</sup>But Jesus answered him, saying, <font color="red">“It is written, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:3">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then the devil, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_6"><sup>6</sup>And the devil said to Him, “All this authority I will give You, and their glory; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 12:31; 14:30; Rev. 13:2, 7)">⚓</a><i>this</i> has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_7"><sup>7</sup>Therefore, if You will worship before me, all will be Yours.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_8"> <sup>8</sup>And Jesus answered and said to him, <font color="red">“Get behind Me, Satan!For it is written, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:13; 10:20; Matt. 4:10">⚓</a><font color="red">‘You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve.’”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:5–7">⚓</a>Then he brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_10"><sup>10</sup>For it is written:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 91:11">⚓</a>‘He shall give His angels charge over you,<br/>   To keep you,’<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_11"> <sup>11</sup>and,<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 91:12">⚓</a>‘In <i>their</i> hands they shall bear you up,<br/>   Lest you dash your foot against a stone.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_12"> <sup>12</sup>And Jesus answered and said to him, <font color="red">“It has been said, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:16">⚓</a><font color="red">‘You shall not tempt the LORD your God.’”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from Him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 14:30; Heb. 4:15; James 4:7)">⚓</a>until an opportune time.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Begins His Galilean Ministry</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_4_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:12">⚓</a>Then Jesus returned <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:43">⚓</a>in the power of the Spirit to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:37">⚓</a>Galilee, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:24">⚓</a>news of Him went out through all the surrounding region. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_15"><sup>15</sup>And He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:22; Matt. 4:23">⚓</a>taught in their synagogues, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 52:13">⚓</a>being glorified by all.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Rejected at Nazareth</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_4_16"> <sup>16</sup>So He came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 2:23; 13:54; Mark 6:1">⚓</a>Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as His custom was, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:21; John 18:20; Acts 13:14–16; 17:2">⚓</a>He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_17"><sup>17</sup>And He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written:<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_18">  <sup>18</sup><font color="red">“The</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 49:8, 9; 61:1, 2; Matt. 11:5; 12:18; John 3:34">⚓</a><font color="red">Spirit of the LORD<i>is</i>upon Me,</font><br/>   <font color="red">Because He has anointed Me</font><br/>   <font color="red">To preach the gospel to<i>the</i>poor;</font><br/>   <font color="red">He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted,</font><br/>   <font color="red">To proclaim liberty to<i>the</i>captives</font><br/>   <font color="red">And recovery of sight to<i>the</i>blind,</font><br/>   <font color="red"><i>To</i></font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 9:24)">⚓</a><font color="red">set at liberty those who are oppressed;</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_19">   <sup>19</sup><font color="red">To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then He closed the book, and gave <i>it</i> back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were fixed on Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_21"><sup>21</sup>And He began to say to them, <font color="red">“Today this Scripture is </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:22, 23; Acts 13:29">⚓</a><font color="red">fulfilled in your hearing.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_22"><sup>22</sup>So all bore witness to Him, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 45:2); Matt. 13:54; Mark 6:2; Luke 2:47; (John 1:14, 17)">⚓</a>marveled at the gracious words which proceeded out of His mouth. And they said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 6:42">⚓</a>“Is this not Joseph’s son?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_23"> <sup>23</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“You will surely say this proverb to Me, ‘Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done in </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:13; 11:23">⚓</a><font color="red">Capernaum, do also here in </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:54; Mark 6:1">⚓</a><font color="red">Your country.’ ”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_24"><sup>24</sup>Then He said, <font color="red">“Assuredly, I say to you, no </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:57; Mark 6:4; John 4:44">⚓</a><font color="red">prophet is accepted in his own country.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">But I tell you truly, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 17:9; James 5:17">⚓</a><font color="red">many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine throughout all the land;</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">but to none of them was Elijah sent except to Zarephath,<i>in the region</i> of Sidon, to a woman <i>who was</i> a widow.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 5:1–14">⚓</a><font color="red">And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_28"> <sup>28</sup>So all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 6:11">⚓</a>filled with wrath, </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_29"><sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 17:25; John 8:37; 10:31">⚓</a>and rose up and thrust Him out of the city; and they led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw Him down over the cliff. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_30"><sup>30</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:59; 10:39">⚓</a>passing through the midst of them, He went His way.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Casts Out an Unclean Spirit</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_4_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 9:1; Matt. 4:13; Mark 1:21">⚓</a>He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbaths. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_32"><sup>32</sup>And they were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 7:28, 29">⚓</a>astonished at His teaching, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:36; (John 6:63; 7:46; 8:26, 28, 38, 47; 12:49, 50)">⚓</a>for His word was with authority. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_33"><sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:23">⚓</a>Now in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice, </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_34"><sup>34</sup>saying, “Let <i>us</i> alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:41">⚓</a>I know who You are—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 16:10; Is. 49:7; Dan. 9:24; Luke 1:35">⚓</a>the Holy One of God!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_4_35"> <sup>35</sup>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, <font color="red">“Be quiet, and come out of him!”</font> And when the demon had thrown him in <i>their</i> midst, it came out of him and did not hurt him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_36"><sup>36</sup>Then they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, “What a word this <i>is!</i> For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.” </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_37"><sup>37</sup>And the report about Him went out into every place in the surrounding region.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter’s Mother-in-Law Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_4_38"> <sup>38</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:14, 15; Mark 1:29–31">⚓</a>Now He arose from the synagogue and entered Simon’s house. But Simon’s wife’s mother was sick with a high fever, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:23">⚓</a>made request of Him concerning her. </span>
<span class="verse lu_4_39"><sup>39</sup>So He stood over her and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 8:24">⚓</a>rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she arose and served them.<br/></span>

<span class="verse lu_4_41"><sup>41</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:34; 3:11; Acts 8:7">⚓</a>And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 8:29">⚓</a>“You are the Christ, the Son of God!”<br/> And He, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:25, 34; 3:11; Luke 4:34, 35">⚓</a>rebuking <i>them,</i> did not allow them to speak, for they knew that He was the Christ.<br/></span>
