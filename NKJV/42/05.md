<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Four Fishermen Called as Disciples</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:18–22; Mark 1:16–20; John 1:40–42">⚓</a>it was, as the multitude pressed about Him to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:44">⚓</a>hear the word of God, that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret, </span>
<span class="verse lu_5_2"><sup>2</sup>and saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing <i>their</i> nets. </span>
<span class="verse lu_5_3"><sup>3</sup>Then He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:2">⚓</a>sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_4"> <sup>4</sup>When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 21:6">⚓</a><font color="red">“Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_5"> <sup>5</sup>But Simon answered and said to Him, “Master, we have toiled all night and caught <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 21:3">⚓</a>nothing; nevertheless <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 33:9">⚓</a>at Your word I will let down the net.” </span>
<span class="verse lu_5_6"><sup>6</sup>And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking. </span>
<span class="verse lu_5_7"><sup>7</sup>So they signaled to <i>their</i> partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. </span>
<span class="verse lu_5_8"><sup>8</sup>When Simon Peter saw <i>it,</i> he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 6:9; 1 Kin. 17:18">⚓</a>“Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_9"> <sup>9</sup>For he and all who were with him were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:42; 10:24, 26">⚓</a>astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken; </span>
<span class="verse lu_5_10"><sup>10</sup>and so also <i>were</i> James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, <font color="red">“Do not be afraid. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:19; Mark 1:17">⚓</a><font color="red">From now on you will catch men.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_11"><sup>11</sup>So when they had brought their boats to land, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:20; 19:27; (Mark 1:18; 8:34, 35; Luke 9:59–62); John 12:26">⚓</a>they forsook all and followed Him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Cleanses a Leper</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_5_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:2–4; Mark 1:40–44">⚓</a>And it happened when He was in a certain city, that behold, a man who was full of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 13:14">⚓</a>leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell on <i>his</i> face and implored Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then He put out <i>His</i> hand and touched him, saying, <font color="red">“I am willing; be cleansed.”</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:34; Luke 8:44; John 5:9">⚓</a>Immediately the leprosy left him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_5_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:4; Luke 17:14">⚓</a>And He charged him to tell no one, <font color="red">“But go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as a testimony to them, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 13:1–3; 14:2–32">⚓</a><font color="red">just as Moses commanded.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_15"> <sup>15</sup>However, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:45">⚓</a>the report went around concerning Him all the more; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:25; Mark 3:7; John 6:2">⚓</a>great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by Him of their infirmities. </span>
<span class="verse lu_5_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 9:10">⚓</a>So He Himself <i>often</i> withdrew into the wilderness and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:23; Mark 1:35; Luke 6:12; 9:18; 11:1">⚓</a>prayed.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralytic</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_5_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now it happened on a certain day, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was <i>present</i> to heal them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_5_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:2–8; Mark 2:3–12">⚓</a>Then behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, whom they sought to bring in and lay before Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_5_19"><sup>19</sup>And when they could not find how they might bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the housetop and let him down with <i>his</i> bed through the tiling into the midst <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:30">⚓</a>before Jesus.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_20"> <sup>20</sup>When He saw their faith, He said to him, <font color="red">“Man, your sins are forgiven you.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:3; 26:65; Mark 2:6, 7; John 10:33">⚓</a>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this who speaks blasphemies? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 32:5; 130:4; Is. 43:25">⚓</a>Who can forgive sins but God alone?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_22"> <sup>22</sup>But when Jesus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 9:47; John 2:25">⚓</a>perceived their thoughts, He answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Why are you reasoning in your hearts?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Rise up and walk’?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins”</font>—He said to the man who was paralyzed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 2:11; 5:41; Luke 7:14">⚓</a><font color="red">“I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_25"> <sup>25</sup>Immediately he rose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and departed to his own house, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 17:15, 18; Acts 3:8">⚓</a>glorifying God. </span>
<span class="verse lu_5_26"><sup>26</sup>And they were all amazed, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:65; 7:16">⚓</a>glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen strange things today!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Matthew the Tax Collector</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_5_27"> <sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:9–17; Mark 2:13–22">⚓</a>After these things He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mark 8:34); Luke 9:59; John 12:26; 21:19, 22">⚓</a><font color="red">“Follow Me.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_28"><sup>28</sup>So he left all, rose up, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:22; 19:27; Mark 10:28">⚓</a>followed Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_29"> <sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:9, 10; Mark 2:15">⚓</a>Then Levi gave Him a great feast in his own house. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 15:1">⚓</a>there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_5_30"><sup>30</sup>And their scribes and the Pharisees complained against His disciples, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:19; Luke 15:2; Acts 23:9">⚓</a>“Why do You eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_31"> <sup>31</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_32"><sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:13; 1 Tim. 1:15">⚓</a><font color="red">I have not come to call <i>the</i> righteous, but sinners, to repentance.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Is Questioned About Fasting</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_5_33"> <sup>33</sup>Then they said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:14; Mark 2:18; Luke 7:33">⚓</a>“Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_34"> <sup>34</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:29">⚓</a><font color="red">bridegroom is with them?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_36"> <sup>36</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:16, 17; Mark 2:21, 22">⚓</a>Then He spoke a parable to them: <font color="red">“No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise the new makes a tear, and also the piece that was <i>taken</i> out of the new does not match the old.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">But new wine must be put into new wineskins, and both are preserved.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_5_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">And no one, having drunk old <i>wine,</i>immediately desires new; for he says, ‘The old is better.’ ”</font><br/></span>
