<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>Jesus Heals a Centurion’s Servant</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now when He concluded all His sayings in the hearing of the people, He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:5–13">⚓</a>entered Capernaum. </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_2"><sup>2</sup>And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die. </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_3"><sup>3</sup>So when he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, pleading with Him to come and heal his servant. </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_4"><sup>4</sup>And when they came to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that the one for whom He should do this was deserving, </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_5"><sup>5</sup>“for he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, “Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof. </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_7"><sup>7</sup>Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 33:9; 107:20">⚓</a>say the word, and my servant will be healed. </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_8"><sup>8</sup>For I also am a man placed under <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mark 13:34)">⚓</a>authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does <i>it.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_9"> <sup>9</sup>When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, <font color="red">“I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_10"><sup>10</sup>And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well who had been sick.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Raises the Son of the Widow of Nain</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_7_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now it happened, the day after, <i>that</i> He went into a city called Nain; and many of His disciples went with Him, and a large crowd. </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_12"><sup>12</sup>And when He came near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her. </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_13"><sup>13</sup>When the Lord saw her, He had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lam. 3:32; John 11:35; (Heb. 4:15)">⚓</a>compassion on her and said to her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 8:52">⚓</a><font color="red">“Do not weep.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_14"><sup>14</sup>Then He came and touched the open coffin, and those who carried <i>him</i> stood still. And He said, <font color="red">“Young man, I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:41; Luke 8:54; John 11:43; Acts 9:40; (Rom. 4:17)">⚓</a><font color="red">arise.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_15"><sup>15</sup>So he who was dead <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:5; Luke 8:55; John 11:44">⚓</a>sat up and began to speak. And He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 17:23; 2 Kin. 4:36">⚓</a>presented him to his mother.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:65">⚓</a>Then fear came upon all, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 5:26">⚓</a>glorified God, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:19; John 4:19; 6:14; 9:17">⚓</a>“A great prophet has risen up among us”; and, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:68">⚓</a>“God has visited His people.” </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_17"><sup>17</sup>And this report about Him went throughout all Judea and all the surrounding region.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>John the Baptist Sends Messengers to Jesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_7_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:2–19">⚓</a>Then the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things. </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_19"><sup>19</sup>And John, calling two of his disciples to <i>him,</i> sent <i>them</i> to Jesus, saying, “Are You <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mic. 5:2; Zech. 9:9; Mal. 3:1–3)">⚓</a>the Coming One, or do we look for another?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_20"> <sup>20</sup>When the men had come to Him, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, ‘Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?’ ” </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_21"><sup>21</sup>And that very hour He cured many of infirmities, afflictions, and evil spirits; and to many blind He gave sight.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_22"> <sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:4">⚓</a>Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard: </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 35:5">⚓</a><font color="red">that <i>the</i> blind </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 9:7">⚓</a><font color="red">see, <i>the</i> lame </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:31">⚓</a><font color="red">walk, <i>the</i> lepers are </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 17:12–14">⚓</a><font color="red">cleansed, <i>the</i> deaf </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:37">⚓</a><font color="red">hear, <i>the</i> dead are raised, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 61:1–3; Luke 4:18)">⚓</a><font color="red"><i>the</i> poor have the gospel preached to them.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">And blessed is <i>he</i> who is not offended because of Me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_24"> <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:7">⚓</a>When the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John: <font color="red">“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings’ courts.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">This is <i>he</i> of whom it is written:</font><br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 40:3; Mal. 3:1; Matt. 11:10; Mark 1:2">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Behold, I send My messenger before Your face,</font><br/>   <font color="red">Who will prepare Your way before You.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">For I say to you, among those born of women there is not a </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 1:15)">⚓</a><font color="red">greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_29"> <sup>29</sup>And when all the people heard <i>Him,</i> even the tax collectors justified God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:5; Luke 3:12">⚓</a>having been baptized with the baptism of John. </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_30"><sup>30</sup>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:27">⚓</a>the will of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_31"> <sup>31</sup>And the Lord said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:16">⚓</a><font color="red">“To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and what are they like?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, saying:</font><br/>  <font color="red">‘We played the flute for you,</font><br/>   <font color="red">And you did not dance;</font><br/>   <font color="red">We mourned to you,</font><br/>   <font color="red">And you did not weep.’</font><br/></span>

<span class="verse lu_7_36"> <sup>36</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:6; Mark 14:3; John 11:2">⚓</a>Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat. </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_37"><sup>37</sup>And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that <i>Jesus</i> sat at the table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil, </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_38"><sup>38</sup>and stood at His feet behind <i>Him</i> weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped <i>them</i> with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed <i>them</i> with the fragrant oil. </span>
<span class="verse lu_7_39"><sup>39</sup>Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw <i>this,</i> he spoke to himself, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 15:2">⚓</a>“This Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman <i>this</i> <i>is</i> who is touching Him, for she is a sinner.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_40"> <sup>40</sup>And Jesus answered and said to him, <font color="red">“Simon, I have something to say to you.”</font><br/> So he said, “Teacher, say it.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_41"> <sup>41</sup><font color="red">“There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:28; Mark 6:37">⚓</a><font color="red">denarii, and the other fifty.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_43"> <sup>43</sup>Simon answered and said, “I suppose the <i>one</i> whom he forgave more.”<br/> And He said to him, <font color="red">“You have rightly judged.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_44"><sup>44</sup>Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon, <font color="red">“Do you see this woman?

<span class="verse lu_7_49"> <sup>49</sup>And those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:3; (Mark 2:7); Luke 5:21">⚓</a>“Who is this who even forgives sins?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_7_50"> <sup>50</sup>Then He said to the woman, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:22; Mark 5:34; 10:52; Luke 8:48; 18:42">⚓</a><font color="red">“Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”</font><br/></span>
