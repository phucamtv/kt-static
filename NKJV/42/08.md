<span class="verse lu_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass, afterward, that He went through every city and village, preaching and bringing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God. And the twelve <i>were</i> with Him, </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_2"><sup>2</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:55; Mark 15:40, 41; Luke 23:49, 55">⚓</a>certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities—Mary called Magdalene, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:56; Mark 16:9">⚓</a>out of whom had come seven demons, </span>

<span class="verse lu_8_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:2–9; Mark 4:1–9">⚓</a>And when a great multitude had gathered, and they had come to Him from every city, He spoke by a parable: </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">“A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">Some fell on rock; and as soon as it sprang up, it withered away because it lacked moisture.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">But others fell on good ground, sprang up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.”</font> When He had said these things He cried, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:15; Mark 7:16; Luke 14:35; Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 13:9">⚓</a><font color="red">“He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Purpose of Parables</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_8_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:10–23; Mark 4:10–20">⚓</a>Then His disciples asked Him, saying, “What does this parable mean?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_10"> <sup>10</sup>And He said, <font color="red">“To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest <i>it is given</i> in parables, that</font><br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 6:9; Matt. 13:14; Acts 28:26">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Seeing they may not see,</font><br/>   <font color="red">And hearing they may not understand.’</font><br/></span>

<span class="verse lu_8_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">But the ones on the rock <i>are those</i> who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">Now the ones <i>that</i> fell among thorns are those who, when they have heard, go out and are choked with cares, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:23; 1 Tim. 6:9, 10">⚓</a><font color="red">riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">But the ones <i>that</i> fell on the good ground are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep <i>it</i> and bear fruit with </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 2:7; Heb. 10:36–39; James 5:7, 8)">⚓</a><font color="red">patience.</font><br/></span>

<div class="title"><h3>Jesus’ Mother and Brothers Come to Him</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_8_19"> <sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:8; Matt. 12:46–50; Mark 3:31–35">⚓</a>Then His mother and brothers came to Him, and could not approach Him because of the crowd. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_20"><sup>20</sup>And it was told Him <i>by</i> <i>some,</i> who said, “Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see You.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_21"> <sup>21</sup>But He answered and said to them, <font color="red">“My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Wind and Wave Obey Jesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_8_22"> <sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:23–27; Mark 4:36–41">⚓</a>Now it happened, on a certain day, that He got into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, <font color="red">“Let us cross over to the other side of the lake.”</font> And they launched out. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_23"><sup>23</sup>But as they sailed He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling <i>with</i> <i>water,</i> and were in jeopardy. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_24"><sup>24</sup>And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!”<br/> Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_25"><sup>25</sup>But He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 9:41">⚓</a><font color="red">“Where is your faith?”</font><br/> And they were afraid, and marveled, saying to one another, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:36; 5:26">⚓</a>“Who can this be? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Demon-Possessed Man Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_8_26"> <sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:28–34; Mark 5:1–17">⚓</a>Then they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_27"><sup>27</sup>And when He stepped out on the land, there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time. And he wore no clothes, nor did he live in a house but in the tombs. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_28"><sup>28</sup>When he saw Jesus, he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:26; 9:26">⚓</a>cried out, fell down before Him, and with a loud voice said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:23, 24">⚓</a>“What have I to do with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:41">⚓</a>You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!” </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_29"><sup>29</sup>For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had often seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_30"> <sup>30</sup>Jesus asked him, saying, <font color="red">“What is your name?”</font><br/> And he said, “Legion,” because many demons had entered him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_31"><sup>31</sup>And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 10:7; (Rev. 20:1, 3)">⚓</a>into the abyss.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_32"> <sup>32</sup>Now a herd of many <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:7; Deut. 14:8">⚓</a>swine was feeding there on the mountain. So they begged Him that He would permit them to enter them. And He permitted them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_33"><sup>33</sup>Then the demons went out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake and drowned.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_34"> <sup>34</sup>When those who fed <i>them</i> saw what had happened, they fled and told <i>it</i> in the city and in the country. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_35"><sup>35</sup>Then they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had departed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 11:28)">⚓</a>sitting at the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:9; Mark 7:25; Luke 10:39; 17:16; John 11:32">⚓</a>feet of Jesus, clothed and in his <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Tim. 1:7)">⚓</a>right mind. And they were afraid. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_36"><sup>36</sup>They also who had seen <i>it</i> told them by what means he who had been demon-possessed was healed. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_37"><sup>37</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:34">⚓</a>Then the whole multitude of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34">⚓</a>asked Him to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 21:14; Acts 16:39">⚓</a>depart from them, for they were seized with great <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 5:26">⚓</a>fear. And He got into the boat and returned.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_38"> <sup>38</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:18–20">⚓</a>the man from whom the demons had departed begged Him that he might be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying, </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">“Return to your own house, and tell what great things God has done for you.”</font> And he went his way and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_8_40"> <sup>40</sup>So it was, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_41"><sup>41</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:18–26; Mark 5:22–43">⚓</a>And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell down at Jesus’ feet and begged Him to come to his house, </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_42"><sup>42</sup>for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age, and she <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:2">⚓</a>was dying.<br/> But as He went, the multitudes thronged Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_43"><sup>43</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:20">⚓</a>Now a woman, having a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 15:19–22">⚓</a>flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and could not be healed by any, </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_44"><sup>44</sup>came from behind and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:56; Luke 5:13">⚓</a>touched the border of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_45"> <sup>45</sup>And Jesus said, <font color="red">“Who touched Me?”</font><br/> When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes throng and press You, and You say, <font color="red">‘Who touched Me?’</font> ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_46"> <sup>46</sup>But Jesus said, <font color="red">“Somebody touched Me, for I perceived </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:30; Luke 6:19">⚓</a><font color="red">power going out from Me.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_47"><sup>47</sup>Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_48"> <sup>48</sup>And He said to her, <font color="red">“Daughter, be of good cheer;</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:34; Luke 7:50">⚓</a><font color="red">your faith has made you well. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:11">⚓</a><font color="red">Go in peace.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_49"> <sup>49</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:35">⚓</a>While He was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue’s <i>house,</i> saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the Teacher.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_50"> <sup>50</sup>But when Jesus heard <i>it,</i> He answered him, saying, <font color="red">“Do not be afraid; </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mark 11:22–24)">⚓</a><font color="red">only believe, and she will be made well.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_51"><sup>51</sup>When He came into the house, He permitted no one to go in except Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_52"><sup>52</sup>Now all wept and mourned for her; but He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:13">⚓</a><font color="red">“Do not weep; she is not dead, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 11:11, 13)">⚓</a><font color="red">but sleeping.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_53"><sup>53</sup>And they ridiculed Him, knowing that she was dead.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_54"> <sup>54</sup>But He put them all outside, took her by the hand and called, saying, <font color="red">“Little girl, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:14; John 11:43">⚓</a><font color="red">arise.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_8_55"><sup>55</sup>Then her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And He commanded that she be given <i>something</i> to eat. </span>
<span class="verse lu_8_56"><sup>56</sup>And her parents were astonished, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:4; 9:30; Mark 5:43">⚓</a>He charged them to tell no one what had happened.<br/></span>
