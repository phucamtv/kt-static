<span class="verse lu_9_8"><sup>8</sup>and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again. </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_9"><sup>9</sup>Herod said, “John I have beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear such things?” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:8">⚓</a>So he sought to see Him.<br/></span>

<span class="verse lu_9_10"> <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:30">⚓</a>And the apostles, when they had returned, told Him all that they had done. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:13">⚓</a>Then He took them and went aside privately into a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida. </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_11"><sup>11</sup>But when the multitudes knew <i>it,</i> they followed Him; and He received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing. </span>

<span class="verse lu_9_14"><sup>14</sup>For there were about five thousand men.<br/> Then He said to His disciples, <font color="red">“Make them sit down in groups of fifty.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_9_15"><sup>15</sup>And they did so, and made them all sit down.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_9_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 22:19; 24:30">⚓</a>blessed and broke them, and gave <i>them</i> to the disciples to set before the multitude. </span>

<span class="verse lu_9_19"> <sup>19</sup>So they answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:2">⚓</a>“John the Baptist, but some <i>say</i> Elijah; and others <i>say</i> that one of the old prophets has risen again.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_9_20"> <sup>20</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“But who do you say that I am?”</font><br/> <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:16; John 6:68, 69">⚓</a>Peter answered and said, “The Christ of God.”<br/></span>

<span class="verse lu_9_28"> <sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:1–8; Mark 9:2–8">⚓</a>Now it came to pass, about eight days after these sayings, that He took Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray. </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_29"><sup>29</sup>As He prayed, the appearance of His face was altered, and His robe <i>became</i> white <i>and</i> glistening. </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_30"><sup>30</sup>And behold, two men talked with Him, who were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 11:23–29">⚓</a>Moses and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 2:1–11">⚓</a>Elijah, </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_31"><sup>31</sup>who appeared in glory and spoke of His decease which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_32"><sup>32</sup>But Peter and those with him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 8:18; 10:9; Matt. 26:40, 43; Mark 14:40">⚓</a>were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_33"><sup>33</sup>Then it happened, as they were parting from Him, <i>that</i> Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah”—not knowing what he said.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_9_34"> <sup>34</sup>While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were fearful as they entered the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 13:21; Acts 1:9">⚓</a>cloud. </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_35"><sup>35</sup>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:7; (Is. 42:1; Matt. 3:17; 12:18); Mark 1:11; Luke 3:22">⚓</a>“This is My beloved Son. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:22">⚓</a>Hear Him!” </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_36"><sup>36</sup>When the voice had ceased, Jesus was found alone. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:9; Mark 9:9">⚓</a>But they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Boy Is Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_9_37"> <sup>37</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:14–18; Mark 9:14–27">⚓</a>Now it happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_38"><sup>38</sup>Suddenly a man from the multitude cried out, saying, “Teacher, I implore You, look on my son, for he is my only child. </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_39"><sup>39</sup>And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him so that he foams <i>at</i> <i>the</i> <i>mouth;</i> and it departs from him with great difficulty, bruising him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_40"><sup>40</sup>So I implored Your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_9_41"> <sup>41</sup>Then Jesus answered and said, <font color="red">“O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_9_42"><sup>42</sup>And as he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed <i>him.</i> Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Again Predicts His Death</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_9_43"> <sup>43</sup>And they were all amazed at the majesty of God.<br/> But while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples, </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_44"><sup>44</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:22; Mark 10:33; 14:53; Luke 22:54; John 18:12">⚓</a><font color="red">“Let these words sink down into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_9_45"><sup>45</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 9:32; Luke 2:50; 18:34">⚓</a>But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this saying.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Who Is the Greatest?</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_9_46"> <sup>46</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:1–5; Mark 9:33–37; Luke 22:24">⚓</a>Then a dispute arose among them as to which of them would be greatest. </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_47"><sup>47</sup>And Jesus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:4; John 2:24, 25">⚓</a>perceiving the thought of their heart, took a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 18:17">⚓</a>little child and set him by Him, </span>
<span class="verse lu_9_48"><sup>48</sup>and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:5">⚓</a><font color="red">“Whoever receives this little child in My name receives Me; and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:40; Mark 9:37; John 12:44">⚓</a><font color="red">whoever receives Me </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 13:20">⚓</a><font color="red">receives Him who sent Me. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 23:11, 12); 1 Cor. 15:9; Eph. 3:8">⚓</a><font color="red">For he who is least among you all will be great.”</font><br/></span>

<span class="verse lu_9_49"> <sup>49</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 9:38–40">⚓</a>Now John answered and said, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_9_50"> <sup>50</sup>But Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Do not forbid <i>him,</i> for </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:30; Luke 11:23">⚓</a><font color="red">he who is not against us is on our side.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Samaritan Village Rejects the Savior</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_9_51"> <sup>51</sup>Now it came to pass, when the time had come for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 50:7; Mark 16:19; Acts 1:2">⚓</a>Him to be received up, that He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem, </span>

<span class="verse lu_9_53"><sup>53</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:4, 9">⚓</a>they did not receive Him, because His face was <i>set</i> for the journey to Jerusalem. </span>

<span class="verse lu_9_55"> <sup>55</sup>But He turned and rebuked them, and said, <font color="red">“You do not know what manner of </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 8:15; 2 Tim. 1:7)">⚓</a><font color="red">spirit you are of.</font></span>
