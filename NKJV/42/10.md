<span class="verse lu_10_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">But whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,</font></span>

<div class="title"><h3>Woe to the Impenitent Cities</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_10_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:21–23">⚓</a><font color="red">“Woe to you, Chorazin!

<div class="title"><h3>The Seventy Return with Joy</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_10_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:1">⚓</a>the seventy returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_18"> <sup>18</sup>And He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:31; Rev. 9:1; 12:8, 9">⚓</a><font color="red">“I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</font></span>

<span class="verse lu_10_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 32:32, 33); Ps. 69:28; Is. 4:3; Dan. 12:1; Phil. 4:3; Heb. 12:23; Rev. 13:8">⚓</a><font color="red">your names are written in heaven.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Rejoices in the Spirit</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_10_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:25–27">⚓</a>In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, <font color="red">“I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from <i>the</i> wise and prudent and revealed them to babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:18; John 3:35; 5:27; 17:2">⚓</a><font color="red">All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:18; 6:44, 46)">⚓</a><font color="red">no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and <i>the one</i> to whom the Son wills to reveal <i>Him.</i>”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then He turned to <i>His</i> disciples and said privately, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:16, 17">⚓</a><font color="red">“Blessed <i>are</i> the eyes which see the things you see;</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">for I tell you </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Pet. 1:10, 11">⚓</a><font color="red">that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not seen <i>it,</i> and to hear what you hear, and have not heard <i>it.</i>”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Good Samaritan</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_10_25"> <sup>25</sup>And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:16–19; 22:35">⚓</a>“Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_26"> <sup>26</sup>He said to him, <font color="red">“What is written in the law? What is your reading <i>of it?</i>”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_27"> <sup>27</sup>So he answered and said, “ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 6:5">⚓</a>‘You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,’ and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:18; Matt. 19:19">⚓</a>‘your neighbor as yourself.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_28"> <sup>28</sup>And He said to him, <font color="red">“You have answered rightly; do this and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 18:5; Neh. 9:29; Ezek. 20:11, 13, 21; Matt. 19:17; Rom. 10:5">⚓</a><font color="red">you will live.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_29"> <sup>29</sup>But he, wanting to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 16:15">⚓</a>justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_30"> <sup>30</sup>Then Jesus answered and said: <font color="red">“A certain <i>man</i> went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, who stripped him of his clothing, wounded <i>him,</i> and departed, leaving <i>him</i> half dead.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">Now by chance a certain priest came down that road. And when he saw him, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 38:11">⚓</a><font color="red">he passed by on the other side.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">Likewise a Levite, when he arrived at the place, came and looked, and passed by on the other side.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">But a certain </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:9">⚓</a><font color="red">Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was. And when he saw him, he had </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 15:20">⚓</a><font color="red">compassion.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_34"><sup>34</sup><font color="red">So he went to <i>him</i> and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and he set him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">On the next day, when he departed, he took out two </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:2">⚓</a><font color="red">denarii, gave <i>them</i> to the innkeeper, and said to him, ‘Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, when I come again, I will repay you.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">So which of these three do you think was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_37"> <sup>37</sup>And he said, “He who showed mercy on him.”<br/> Then Jesus said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 14:21; (Matt. 9:13; 12:7)">⚓</a><font color="red">“Go and do likewise.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Mary and Martha Worship and Serve</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_10_38"> <sup>38</sup>Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:1; 12:2, 3">⚓</a>Martha welcomed Him into her house. </span>
<span class="verse lu_10_39"><sup>39</sup>And she had a sister called Mary, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 7:32–40)">⚓</a>who also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 8:35; Acts 22:3">⚓</a>sat at Jesus’ feet and heard His word. </span>
<span class="verse lu_10_40"><sup>40</sup>But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she approached Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_41"> <sup>41</sup>And Jesus answered and said to her, <font color="red">“Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_10_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">But </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 27:4; John 6:27)">⚓</a><font color="red">one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.”</font><br/></span>
