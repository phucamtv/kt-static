<span class="verse lu_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>There were present at that season some who told Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. </span>
<span class="verse lu_13_2"><sup>2</sup>And Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Do you suppose that these Galileans were worse sinners than all <i>other</i> Galileans, because they suffered such things?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they were worse sinners than all <i>other</i> men who dwelt in Jerusalem?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_13_6"> <sup>6</sup>He also spoke this parable: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 5:2; Matt. 21:19">⚓</a><font color="red">“A certain <i>man</i> had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard, ‘Look, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why does it use up the ground?’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">But he answered and said to him, ‘Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize <i>it.</i></font></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">And if it bears fruit, <i>well.</i> But if not, after that you can </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 15:2)">⚓</a><font color="red">cut it down.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Spirit of Infirmity</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_13_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath. </span>
<span class="verse lu_13_11"><sup>11</sup>And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bent over and could in no way raise <i>herself</i> up. </span>
<span class="verse lu_13_12"><sup>12</sup>But when Jesus saw her, He called <i>her</i> to <i>Him</i> and said to her, <font color="red">“Woman, you are loosed from your </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:21; 8:2">⚓</a><font color="red">infirmity.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:18; Acts 9:17">⚓</a>And He laid <i>His</i> hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_14"> <sup>14</sup>But the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 6:6–11; 14:1–6); John 5:16">⚓</a>healed on the Sabbath; and he said to the crowd, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:9; 23:12">⚓</a>“There are six days on which men ought to work; therefore come and be healed on them, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:10; Mark 3:2; Luke 6:7; 14:3">⚓</a>not on the Sabbath day.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_15"> <sup>15</sup>The Lord then answered him and said, <font color="red">“Hypocrite!</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 7:5; 23:13); Luke 14:5">⚓</a><font color="red">Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or donkey from the stall, and lead <i>it</i> away to water it?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">So ought not this woman, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 19:9">⚓</a><font color="red">being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound—think of it—for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_17"><sup>17</sup>And when He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:19, 20">⚓</a>done by Him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Mustard Seed</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_13_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:31, 32; Mark 4:30–32">⚓</a>Then He said, <font color="red">“What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and put in his garden; and it grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Leaven</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_13_20"> <sup>20</sup>And again He said, <font color="red">“To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:33">⚓</a><font color="red">measures of meal till it was all leavened.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Narrow Way</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_13_22"> <sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:35; Mark 6:6">⚓</a>And He went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse lu_13_23"><sup>23</sup>Then one said to Him, “Lord, are there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 7:14; 20:16)">⚓</a>few who are saved?”<br/> And He said to them, </span>

<span class="verse lu_13_31"> <sup>31</sup>On that very day some Pharisees came, saying to Him, “Get out and depart from here, for Herod wants to kill You.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_13_32"> <sup>32</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“Go, tell that fox, ‘Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third <i>day</i></font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:46; Acts 10:40; 1 Cor. 15:4; (Heb. 2:10; 5:9; 7:28)">⚓</a><font color="red">I shall be perfected.’</font></span>
