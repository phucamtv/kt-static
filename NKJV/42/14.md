<div class="title"><h1>14</h1><h3>A Man with Dropsy Healed on the Sabbath</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_14_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it happened, as He went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees to eat bread on the Sabbath, that they watched Him closely. </span>
<span class="verse lu_14_2"><sup>2</sup>And behold, there was a certain man before Him who had dropsy. </span>
<span class="verse lu_14_3"><sup>3</sup>And Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:10">⚓</a><font color="red">“Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_4"> <sup>4</sup>But they kept silent. And He took <i>him</i> and healed him, and let him go. </span>
<span class="verse lu_14_5"><sup>5</sup>Then He answered them, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 23:5; Deut. 22:4); Luke 13:15">⚓</a><font color="red">“Which of you, having a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_6"><sup>6</sup>And they could not answer Him regarding these things.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Take the Lowly Place</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_14_7"> <sup>7</sup>So He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose the best places, saying to them: </span>
<span class="verse lu_14_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">“When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in the best place, lest one more honorable than you be invited by him;</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">and he who invited you and him come and say to you, ‘Give place to this man,’ and then you begin with shame to take the lowest place.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 25:6, 7">⚓</a><font color="red">But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place, so that when he who invited you comes he may say to you, ‘Friend, go up higher.’ Then you will have glory in the presence of those who sit at the table with you.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 22:29; Ps. 18:27; Prov. 29:23; Matt. 23:12; Luke 18:14; James 4:6; (1 Pet. 5:5)">⚓</a><font color="red">For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then He also said to him who invited Him, <font color="red">“When you give a dinner or a supper, do not ask your friends, your brothers, your relatives, nor rich neighbors, lest they also invite you back, and you be repaid.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">But when you give a feast, invite </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 8:10, 12">⚓</a><font color="red"><i>the</i> poor, <i>the</i>maimed, <i>the</i> lame, <i>the</i> blind.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">And you will be </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 25:34–40)">⚓</a><font color="red">blessed, because they cannot repay you; for you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Great Supper</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_14_15"> <sup>15</sup>Now when one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 19:9">⚓</a>“Blessed <i>is</i> he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:2–14">⚓</a>Then He said to him, <font color="red">“A certain man gave a great supper and invited many,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 9:2, 5">⚓</a><font color="red">sent his servant at supper time to say to those who were invited, ‘Come, for all things are now ready.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">But they all with one <i>accord</i> began to make excuses. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a piece of ground, and I must go and see it. I ask you to have me excused.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">And another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I ask you to have me excused.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">Still another said, ‘I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">So that servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here <i>the</i> poor and <i>the</i>maimed and <i>the</i> lame and <i>the</i> blind.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">And the servant said, ‘Master, it is done as you commanded, and still there is room.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">Then the master said to the servant, ‘Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel <i>them</i> to come in, that my house may be filled.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">For I say to you </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 21:43; 22:8; Acts 13:46)">⚓</a><font color="red">that none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Leaving All to Follow Christ</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_14_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now great multitudes went with Him. And He turned and said to them, </span>
<span class="verse lu_14_26"><sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:6; 33:9; Matt. 10:37">⚓</a><font color="red">“If anyone comes to Me </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 9:13">⚓</a><font color="red">and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 12:11">⚓</a><font color="red">yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">And </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:24; Mark 8:34; Luke 9:23; (2 Tim. 3:12)">⚓</a><font color="red">whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">For </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 24:27">⚓</a><font color="red">which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has <i>enough</i> to finish <i>it</i>—</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">lest, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see <i>it</i> begin to mock him,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish’?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">So likewise, whoever of you </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:27">⚓</a><font color="red">does not forsake all that he has cannot be My disciple.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Tasteless Salt Is Worthless</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_14_34"> <sup>34</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 5:13; (Mark 9:50)">⚓</a><font color="red">“Salt <i>is</i> good; but if the salt has lost its flavor, how shall it be seasoned?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_14_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill, <i>but</i> men throw it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”</font><br/></span>
