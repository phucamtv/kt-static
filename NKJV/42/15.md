<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>The Parable of the Lost Sheep</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 9:10–13)">⚓</a>all the tax collectors and the sinners drew near to Him to hear Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_15_2"><sup>2</sup>And the Pharisees and scribes complained, saying, “This Man receives sinners <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:3; Gal. 2:12">⚓</a>and eats with them.” </span>
<span class="verse lu_15_3"><sup>3</sup>So He spoke this parable to them, saying:<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:12–14; 1 Pet. 2:25">⚓</a><font color="red">“What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">And when he has found <i>it,</i> he lays <i>it</i> on his shoulders, rejoicing.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">And when he comes home, he calls together <i>his</i> friends and neighbors, saying to them, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 12:15)">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 19:10; 1 Pet. 2:10, 25)">⚓</a><font color="red">which was lost!’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 5:32)">⚓</a><font color="red">than over ninety-nine just persons who </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mark 2:17)">⚓</a><font color="red">need no repentance.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Lost Coin</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_15_8"> <sup>8</sup><font color="red">“Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds <i>it?</i></font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">And when she has found <i>it,</i> she calls <i>her</i> friends and neighbors together, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost!’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Lost Son</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_15_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then He said: <font color="red">“A certain man had two sons.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">And the younger of them said to <i>his</i> father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods that falls <i>to me.</i>’ So he divided to them </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 12:44">⚓</a><font color="red"><i>his</i> livelihood.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">But when he had spent all, there arose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be in want.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods that the swine ate, and no one gave him <i>anything.</i></font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_17"> <sup>17</sup><font color="red">“But when he came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:27; 10:16; Num. 22:34; Josh. 7:20; 1 Sam. 15:24, 30; 26:21; 2 Sam. 12:13; 24:10, 17; Ps. 51:4; Matt. 27:4">⚓</a><font color="red">I have sinned against heaven and before you,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.” ’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_20"> <sup>20</sup><font color="red">“And he arose and came to his father. But </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Jer. 3:12); Matt. 9:36; (Acts 2:39; Eph. 2:13, 17)">⚓</a><font color="red">when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 51:4">⚓</a><font color="red">and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_22"> <sup>22</sup><font color="red">“But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe and put <i>it</i> on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on <i>his</i> feet.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">And bring the fatted calf here and kill <i>it,</i> and let us eat and be merry;</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:22; Luke 9:60; 15:32; Rom. 11:15; (Eph. 2:1, 5; 5:14; Col. 2:13; 1 Tim. 5:6)">⚓</a><font color="red">for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ And they began to be merry.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_25"> <sup>25</sup><font color="red">“Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and because he has received him safe and sound, your father has killed the fatted calf.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_28"> <sup>28</sup><font color="red">“But he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and pleaded with him.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_29"><sup>29</sup><font color="red">So he answered and said to <i>his</i> father, ‘Lo, these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_31"> <sup>31</sup><font color="red">“And he said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_15_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">It was right that we should make merry and be glad, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 15:24">⚓</a><font color="red">for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.’ ”</font><br/></span>
