<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>The Parable of the Unjust Steward</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>He also said to His disciples: <font color="red">“There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and an accusation was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">So he called him and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 14:12; 2 Cor. 5:10; 1 Pet. 4:5, 6)">⚓</a><font color="red">account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_3"> <sup>3</sup><font color="red">“Then the steward said within himself, ‘What shall I do? For my master is taking the stewardship away from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">I have resolved what to do, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_5"> <sup>5</sup><font color="red">“So he called every one of his master’s debtors to <i>him,</i> and said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_6"><sup>6</sup><font color="red">And he said, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ So he said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ So he said, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ And he said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">So the master commended the unjust steward because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in their generation than </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 12:36; Eph. 5:8); 1 Thess. 5:5">⚓</a><font color="red">the sons of light.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_9"> <sup>9</sup><font color="red">“And I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 4:27; (Matt. 6:19; 19:21); Luke 11:41; (1 Tim. 6:17–19)">⚓</a><font color="red">make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon, that when you fail, they may receive you into an everlasting home.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 25:21; Luke 19:17">⚓</a><font color="red">He who <i>is</i> faithful in <i>what is</i> least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in <i>what is</i> least is unjust also in much.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <i>riches?</i></font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">And if you have not been faithful in what is another man’s, who will give you what is your </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Pet. 1:3, 4)">⚓</a><font color="red">own?</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 6:24; Gal. 1:10">⚓</a><font color="red">“No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.”</font><br/></span>

<span class="verse lu_16_14"> <sup>14</sup>Now the Pharisees, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 23:14">⚓</a>who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they derided Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_16_15"><sup>15</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“You are those who </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:29">⚓</a><font color="red">justify yourselves </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 6:2, 5, 16)">⚓</a><font color="red">before men, but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 28:9; 2 Chr. 6:30; Ps. 7:9; Prov. 15:11; Jer. 17:10">⚓</a><font color="red">God knows your hearts.

<span class="verse lu_16_19"> <sup>19</sup><font color="red">“There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">But there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, full of sores, who was laid at his gate,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">So it was that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:11">⚓</a><font color="red">Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_16_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">And being in torments in Hades, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</font><br/></span>
