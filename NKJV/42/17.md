<div class="title"><h1>17</h1><h3>Jesus Warns of Offenses</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then He said to the disciples, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 11:19)">⚓</a><font color="red">“It is impossible that no offenses should come, but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:6, 7; 26:24; Mark 9:42; (2 Thess. 1:6); Jude 11">⚓</a><font color="red">woe <i>to him</i> through whom they do come!</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_2"><sup>2</sup><font color="red">It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">Take heed to yourselves. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 18:15, 21)">⚓</a><font color="red">If your brother sins against you,</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:17; (Prov. 17:10; Gal. 6:1; James 5:19, 20)">⚓</a><font color="red">rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day returns to you, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Faith and Duty</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_17_5"> <sup>5</sup>And the apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_6"> <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:20; 21:21; (Mark 9:23; 11:23); Luke 13:19">⚓</a>So the Lord said, <font color="red">“If you have faith as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">And which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, ‘Come at once and sit down to eat’?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">But will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare something for my supper, and gird yourself </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 12:37)">⚓</a><font color="red">and serve me till I have eaten and drunk, and afterward you will eat and drink’?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_9"><sup>9</sup><font color="red">Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">So likewise you, when you have done all those things which you are commanded, say, ‘We are </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 22:3; 35:7; Ps. 16:2; Matt. 25:30; Rom. 3:12; 11:35; (1 Cor. 9:16, 17); Philem. 11">⚓</a><font color="red">unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ten Lepers Cleansed</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_17_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now it happened <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 9:51, 52; John 4:4">⚓</a>as He went to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. </span>
<span class="verse lu_17_12"><sup>12</sup>Then as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 13:46; Num. 5:2">⚓</a>who stood afar off. </span>
<span class="verse lu_17_13"><sup>13</sup>And they lifted up <i>their</i> voices and said, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_14"> <sup>14</sup>So when He saw <i>them,</i> He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 13:1–59; 14:1–32; Matt. 8:4; Luke 5:14">⚓</a><font color="red">“Go, show yourselves to the priests.”</font> And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_15"> <sup>15</sup>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 5:25; 18:43">⚓</a>glorified God, </span>
<span class="verse lu_17_16"><sup>16</sup>and fell down on <i>his</i> face at His feet, giving Him thanks. And he was a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:24; Luke 9:52, 53; John 4:9">⚓</a>Samaritan.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_17"> <sup>17</sup>So Jesus answered and said, <font color="red">“Were there not ten cleansed? But where <i>are</i> the nine?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:22; Mark 5:34; 10:52; Luke 7:50; 8:48; 18:42">⚓</a>And He said to him, <font color="red">“Arise, go your way. Your faith has made you well.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Coming of the Kingdom</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_17_20"> <sup>20</sup>Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, <font color="red">“The kingdom of God does not come with observation;</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 17:23">⚓</a><font color="red">nor will they say, ‘See here!’ or ‘See there!’ For indeed, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 14:17)">⚓</a><font color="red">the kingdom of God is within you.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then He said to the disciples, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:15; Mark 2:20; Luke 5:35; (John 17:12)">⚓</a><font color="red">“The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see <i>it.</i></font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 24:23; Mark 13:21; (Luke 21:8)">⚓</a><font color="red">And they will say to you, ‘Look here!’ or ‘Look there!’ Do not go after <i>them</i> or follow <i>them.</i></font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 24:27">⚓</a><font color="red">For as the lightning that flashes out of one <i>part</i> under heaven shines to the other <i>part</i> under heaven, so also the Son of Man will be in His day.</font></span>

<span class="verse lu_17_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 7:1–16">⚓</a><font color="red">day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 7:19–23">⚓</a><font color="red">destroyed them all.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_17_28"><sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19">⚓</a><font color="red">Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot: They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;</font></span>
