<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>The Parable of the Persistent Widow</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then He spoke a parable to them, that men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 11:5–10; Rom. 12:12; (Eph. 6:18); Col. 4:2; 1 Thess. 5:17">⚓</a>always ought to pray and not lose heart, </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_2"><sup>2</sup>saying: <font color="red">“There was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God nor regard man.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_3"><sup>3</sup><font color="red">Now there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, ‘Get justice for me from my adversary.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">And he would not for a while; but afterward he said within himself, ‘Though I do not fear God nor regard man,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 11:8">⚓</a><font color="red">yet because this widow troubles me I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then the Lord said, <font color="red">“Hear what the unjust judge said.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_7"><sup>7</sup><font color="red">And </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 6:10">⚓</a><font color="red">shall God not avenge His own elect who cry out day and night to Him, though He bears long with them?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">I tell you </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 10:37; (2 Pet. 3:8, 9)">⚓</a><font color="red">that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He really find faith on the earth?”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_18_9"> <sup>9</sup>Also He spoke this parable to some <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 30:12; Luke 10:29; 16:15">⚓</a>who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">The Pharisee </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 135:2">⚓</a><font color="red">stood and prayed thus with himself, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 1:15; 58:2; Rev. 3:17">⚓</a><font color="red">‘God, I thank You that I am not like other men—extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise <i>his</i> eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me a sinner!’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified <i>rather</i> than the other; </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 22:29; Matt. 23:12; Luke 14:11; (James 4:6; 1 Pet. 5:5)">⚓</a><font color="red">for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Blesses Little Children</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_18_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:13–15; Mark 10:13–16">⚓</a>Then they also brought infants to Him that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw <i>it,</i> they rebuked them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_16"><sup>16</sup>But Jesus called them to <i>Him</i> and said, <font color="red">“Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:3; 1 Cor. 14:20; 1 Pet. 2:2">⚓</a><font color="red">of such is the kingdom of God.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:3; 19:14; Mark 10:15">⚓</a><font color="red">Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Counsels the Rich Young Ruler</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_18_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:16–29; Mark 10:17–30">⚓</a>Now a certain ruler asked Him, saying, “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_19"> <sup>19</sup>So Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Why do you call Me good? No one <i>is</i> good but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 86:5; 119:68">⚓</a><font color="red">One, <i>that is,</i> God.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_20"><sup>20</sup><font color="red">You know the commandments: </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:12–16; Deut. 5:16–20; Mark 10:19; Rom. 13:9">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not bear false witness,’ </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 6:2; Col. 3:20">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Honor your father and your mother.’”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_21"> <sup>21</sup>And he said, “All <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 3:6">⚓</a>these things I have kept from my youth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_22"> <sup>22</sup>So when Jesus heard these things, He said to him, <font color="red">“You still lack one thing. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 6:19, 20; 19:21; (1 Tim. 6:19)">⚓</a><font color="red">Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_23"> <sup>23</sup>But when he heard this, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>With God All Things Are Possible</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_18_24"> <sup>24</sup>And when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 11:28; Matt. 19:23; Mark 10:23">⚓</a><font color="red">“How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_26"> <sup>26</sup>And those who heard it said, “Who then can be saved?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_27"> <sup>27</sup>But He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 42:2; Jer. 32:17; Zech. 8:6; Matt. 19:26; Luke 1:37">⚓</a><font color="red">“The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_28"> <sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 19:27">⚓</a>Then Peter said, “See, we have left all and followed You.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_29"> <sup>29</sup>So He said to them, <font color="red">“Assuredly, I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:9">⚓</a><font color="red">there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 42:10">⚓</a><font color="red">who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the age to come eternal life.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus a Third Time Predicts His Death and Resurrection</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_18_31"> <sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:21; 17:22; 20:17; Mark 10:32; Luke 9:51">⚓</a>Then He took the twelve aside and said to them, <font color="red">“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22; (Is. 53)">⚓</a><font color="red">that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">For </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:67; 27:2, 29, 41; Mark 14:65; 15:1, 19, 20, 31; Luke 23:1; John 18:28; Acts 3:13">⚓</a><font color="red">He will be delivered to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">They will scourge <i>Him</i> and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_34"> <sup>34</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 9:32; Luke 2:50; 9:45; (John 10:6; 12:16)">⚓</a>But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know the things which were spoken.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Blind Man Receives His Sight</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_18_35"> <sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:29–34; Mark 10:46–52">⚓</a>Then it happened, as He was coming near Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the road begging. </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_36"><sup>36</sup>And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what it meant. </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_37"><sup>37</sup>So they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_38"><sup>38</sup>And he cried out, saying, “Jesus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:27">⚓</a>Son of David, have mercy on me!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_39"> <sup>39</sup>Then those who went before warned him that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_40"> <sup>40</sup>So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He asked him, </span>
<span class="verse lu_18_41"><sup>41</sup>saying, <font color="red">“What do you want Me to do for you?”</font><br/> He said, “Lord, that I may receive my sight.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_42"> <sup>42</sup>Then Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Receive your sight; </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 17:19">⚓</a><font color="red">your faith has made you well.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_18_43"><sup>43</sup>And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 5:26; Acts 4:21; 11:18">⚓</a>glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw <i>it,</i> gave praise to God.<br/></span>
