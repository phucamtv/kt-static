<div class="title"><h1>19</h1><h3>Jesus Comes to Zacchaeus’ House</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <i>Jesus</i> entered and passed through <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 6:26; 1 Kin. 16:34">⚓</a>Jericho. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_2"><sup>2</sup>Now behold, <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_3"><sup>3</sup>And he sought to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:21">⚓</a>see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_4"><sup>4</sup>So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that <i>way.</i></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_5"><sup>5</sup>And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, <font color="red">“Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_6"><sup>6</sup>So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_7"><sup>7</sup>But when they saw <i>it,</i> they all complained, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:11; Luke 5:30; 15:2">⚓</a>“He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 41:1)">⚓</a>poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 3:14">⚓</a>false accusation, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:1; Lev. 6:5; Num. 5:7; 1 Sam. 12:3; 2 Sam. 12:6">⚓</a>I restore fourfold.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_9"> <sup>9</sup>And Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Today salvation has come to this house, because </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 3:8; 13:16; (Rom. 4:16; Gal. 3:7)">⚓</a><font color="red">he also is </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 13:16)">⚓</a><font color="red">a son of Abraham;</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:11; (Luke 5:32; Rom. 5:8)">⚓</a><font color="red">for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Minas</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_19_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now as they heard these things, He spoke another parable, because He was near Jerusalem and because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:6">⚓</a>they thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 25:14–30; Mark 13:34">⚓</a>Therefore He said: <font color="red">“A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_13"><sup>13</sup><font color="red">So he called ten of his servants, delivered to them ten minas, and said to them, ‘Do business till I come.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:11)">⚓</a><font color="red">But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We will not have this <i>man</i> to reign over us.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_15"> <sup>15</sup><font color="red">“And so it was that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he then commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">Then came the first, saying, ‘Master, your mina has earned ten minas.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">And he said to him, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 25:21, 23">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Well <i>done,</i> good servant; because you were </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 16:10">⚓</a><font color="red">faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">And the second came, saying, ‘Master, your mina has earned five minas.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_19"><sup>19</sup><font color="red">Likewise he said to him, ‘You also be over five cities.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_20"> <sup>20</sup>“Then another came, saying, <font color="red">‘Master, here is your mina, which I have kept put away in a handkerchief.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 25:24">⚓</a><font color="red">For I feared you, because you are an austere man. You collect what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">And he said to him, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 1:16; Job 15:6; (Matt. 12:37)">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Out of your own mouth I will judge you, <i>you</i> wicked servant. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 25:26">⚓</a><font color="red">You knew that I was an austere man, collecting what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_24"> <sup>24</sup><font color="red">“And he said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina from him, and give <i>it</i> to him who has ten minas.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_25"><sup>25</sup><font color="red">(But they said to him, ‘Master, he has ten minas.’)</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">‘For I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:12; 25:29; Mark 4:25; Luke 8:18">⚓</a><font color="red">that to everyone who has will be given; and from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_27"><sup>27</sup><font color="red">But bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, and slay <i>them</i> before me.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Triumphal Entry</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_19_28"> <sup>28</sup>When He had said this, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 10:32">⚓</a>He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_29"><sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:1; Mark 11:1">⚓</a>And it came to pass, when He drew near to Bethphage and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:6; John 12:1">⚓</a>Bethany, at the mountain called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:1; Acts 1:12">⚓</a>Olivet, <i>that</i> He sent two of His disciples, </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_30"><sup>30</sup>saying, <font color="red">“Go into the village opposite <i>you,</i> where as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Loose it and bring <i>it here.</i></font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">And if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you loosing <i>it?</i>’ thus you shall say to him, ‘Because the Lord has need of it.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_32"> <sup>32</sup>So those who were sent went their way and found <i>it</i> just <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 22:13">⚓</a>as He had said to them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_33"><sup>33</sup>But as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, “Why are you loosing the colt?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_34"> <sup>34</sup>And they said, “The Lord has need of him.” </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_35"><sup>35</sup>Then they brought him to Jesus. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:13; Matt. 21:7; Mark 11:7">⚓</a>And they threw their own clothes on the colt, and they set Jesus on him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_36"><sup>36</sup>And as He went, <i>many</i> spread their clothes on the road.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_37"> <sup>37</sup>Then, as He was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 13:17; 18:43">⚓</a>rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen, </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_38"><sup>38</sup>saying:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 118:26; Luke 13:35">⚓</a>“ ‘Blessed <i>is</i> the King who comes in the name of the LORD!’<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:14; (Eph. 2:14)">⚓</a>Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_39"> <sup>39</sup>And some of the Pharisees called to Him from the crowd, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_40"> <sup>40</sup>But He answered and said to them, <font color="red">“I tell you that if these should keep silent, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hab. 2:11">⚓</a><font color="red">the stones would immediately cry out.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Weeps over Jerusalem</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_19_41"> <sup>41</sup>Now as He drew near, He saw the city and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:3; John 11:35">⚓</a>wept over it, </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_42"><sup>42</sup>saying, <font color="red">“If you had known, even you, especially in this </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 95:7, 8; Heb. 3:13">⚓</a><font color="red">your day, the things <i>that</i> </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 1:77–79; Acts 10:36)">⚓</a><font color="red"><i>make</i> for your </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 5:1)">⚓</a><font color="red">peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_43"><sup>43</sup><font color="red">For days will come upon you when your enemies will </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 29:3, 4; Jer. 6:3, 6; Luke 21:20">⚓</a><font color="red">build an embankment around you, surround you and close you in on every side,</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_44"><sup>44</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 9:7, 8; Mic. 3:12">⚓</a><font color="red">and level you, and your children within you, to the ground; and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 24:2; Mark 13:2; Luke 21:6">⚓</a><font color="red">they will not leave in you one stone upon another, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 9:24; Luke 1:68, 78; 1 Pet. 2:12)">⚓</a><font color="red">because you did not know the time of your visitation.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_19_45"> <sup>45</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 3:1; Matt. 21:12, 13; Mark 11:11, 15–17; John 2:13–16">⚓</a>Then He went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it, </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_46"><sup>46</sup>saying to them, <font color="red">“It is written, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 56:7">⚓</a><font color="red">‘My house isa house of prayer,’but you have made it a</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 7:11">⚓</a><font color="red">‘den of thieves.’ ”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_19_47"> <sup>47</sup>And He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 21:37; 22:53">⚓</a>was teaching daily in the temple. But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 11:18; Luke 20:19; John 7:19; 8:37">⚓</a>the chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people sought to destroy Him, </span>
<span class="verse lu_19_48"><sup>48</sup>and were unable to do anything; for all the people were very attentive to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 21:38">⚓</a>hear Him.<br/></span>
