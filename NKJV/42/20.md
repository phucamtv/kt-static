<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>Jesus’ Authority Questioned</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:23–27; Mark 11:27–33">⚓</a>it happened on one of those days, as He taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel, <i>that</i> the chief priests and the scribes, together with the elders, confronted <i>Him</i></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_2"><sup>2</sup>and spoke to Him, saying, “Tell us, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:7; 7:27">⚓</a>by what authority are You doing these things? Or who is he who gave You this authority?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_3"> <sup>3</sup>But He answered and said to them, <font color="red">“I also will ask you one thing, and answer Me:</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_4"><sup>4</sup><font color="red">The </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:26, 31">⚓</a><font color="red">baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_5"> <sup>5</sup>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_6"><sup>6</sup>But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:5; 21:26; Mark 6:20; Luke 7:24–30">⚓</a>for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.” </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_7"><sup>7</sup>So they answered that they did not know where <i>it</i> <i>was</i> from.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_8"> <sup>8</sup>And Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Parable of the Wicked Vinedressers</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_20_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then He began to tell the people this parable: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 80:8; Matt. 21:33–46; Mark 12:1–12">⚓</a><font color="red">“A certain man planted a vineyard, leased it to vinedressers, and went into a far country for a long time.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">Now at vintage-time he </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:13, 14; 2 Chr. 36:15, 16; (Acts 7:52; 1 Thess. 2:15)">⚓</a><font color="red">sent a servant to the vinedressers, that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the vinedressers beat him and sent <i>him</i> away empty-handed.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_11"><sup>11</sup><font color="red">Again he sent another servant; and they beat him also, treated <i>him</i> shamefully, and sent <i>him</i> away empty-handed.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and cast <i>him</i> out.</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_13"> <sup>13</sup>“Then the owner of the vineyard said, <font color="red">‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Probably they will respect <i>him</i> when they see him.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 1:1–3)">⚓</a><font color="red">heir. Come, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:21–23">⚓</a><font color="red">let us kill him, that the inheritance may be </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:47, 48">⚓</a><font color="red">ours.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">So they cast him out of the vineyard and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:33; Acts 2:22, 23; 3:15">⚓</a><font color="red">killed <i>him.</i> Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">He will come and destroy those vinedressers and give the vineyard to </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:11–13); Rom. 11:1, 11; 1 Cor. 6:15; Gal. 2:17; 3:21; 6:14">⚓</a><font color="red">others.”</font><br/> And when they heard <i>it</i> they said, “Certainly not!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then He looked at them and said, <font color="red">“What then is this that is written:</font><br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 118:22; Matt. 21:42; 1 Pet. 2:7, 8">⚓</a><font color="red">‘The stone which the builders rejected</font><br/>   <font color="red">Has become the chief cornerstone’?</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_18"> <sup>18</sup><font color="red">Whoever falls on that stone will be </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 8:14, 15">⚓</a><font color="red">broken; but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 2:34, 35, 44, 45); Matt. 21:44">⚓</a><font color="red">on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_19"> <sup>19</sup>And the chief priests and the scribes that very hour sought to lay hands on Him, but they feared the people —for they knew He had spoken this parable against them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Pharisees: Is It Lawful to Pay Taxes to Caesar?</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_20_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:15">⚓</a>So they watched <i>Him,</i> and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might seize on His words, in order to deliver Him to the power and the authority of the governor.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then they asked Him, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:16; Mark 12:14">⚓</a>“Teacher, we know that You say and teach rightly, and You do not show personal favoritism, but teach the way of God in truth: </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_22"><sup>22</sup>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_23"> <sup>23</sup>But He perceived their craftiness, and said to them, <font color="red">“Why do you test Me?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?”</font><br/> They answered and said, “Caesar’s.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_25"> <sup>25</sup>And He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:24–27; Rom. 13:7; (1 Pet. 2:13–17)">⚓</a><font color="red">“Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_26"> <sup>26</sup>But they could not catch Him in His words in the presence of the people. And they marveled at His answer and kept silent.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Sadducees: What About the Resurrection?</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_20_27"> <sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:23–33; Mark 12:18–27">⚓</a>Then some of the Sadducees, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:6, 8">⚓</a>who deny that there is a resurrection, came to <i>Him</i> and asked Him, </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_28"><sup>28</sup>saying: “Teacher, Moses wrote to us <i>that</i> if a man’s brother dies, having a wife, and he dies without children, his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother. </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_29"><sup>29</sup>Now there were seven brothers. And the first took a wife, and died without children. </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_30"><sup>30</sup>And the second took her as wife, and he died childless. </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_31"><sup>31</sup>Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven also; and they left no children, and died. </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_32"><sup>32</sup>Last of all the woman died also. </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_33"><sup>33</sup>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife does she become? For all seven had her as wife.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_34"> <sup>34</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">But those who are </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 3:11">⚓</a><font color="red">counted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_36"><sup>36</sup><font color="red">nor can they die anymore, for </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 15:42, 49, 52; 1 John 3:2)">⚓</a><font color="red">they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 8:23">⚓</a><font color="red">being sons of the resurrection.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">But even Moses showed in the <i>burning</i> bush <i>passage</i> that the dead are raised, when he called the Lord </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:1–6, 15; Acts 7:30–32">⚓</a><font color="red">‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">For He is not the God of the dead but of the living, for </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 6:10, 11; 14:8, 9; Heb. 11:16)">⚓</a><font color="red">all live to Him.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_39"> <sup>39</sup>Then some of the scribes answered and said, “Teacher, You have spoken well.” </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_40"><sup>40</sup>But after that they dared not question Him anymore.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus: How Can David Call His Descendant Lord?</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_20_41"> <sup>41</sup>And He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:41–46; Mark 12:35–37">⚓</a><font color="red">“How can they say that the Christ is the Son of David?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_20_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">Now David himself said in the Book of Psalms:</font><br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 110:1; Acts 2:34, 35">⚓</a><font color="red">‘The </font>LORD<font color="red"> said to my Lord,</font><br/>   <font color="red">“Sit at My right hand,</font><br/></span>

<span class="verse lu_20_44"> <sup>44</sup><font color="red">Therefore David calls Him ‘Lord’; </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:22, 23; Rom. 1:3; 9:4, 5">⚓</a><font color="red">how is He then his Son?”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Beware of the Scribes</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_20_45"> <sup>45</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 23:1–7; Mark 12:38–40">⚓</a>Then, in the hearing of all the people, He said to His disciples, </span>
<span class="verse lu_20_46"><sup>46</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 23:5">⚓</a><font color="red">“Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 11:43; 14:7">⚓</a><font color="red">love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts,</font></span>
