<span class="verse lu_22_4"><sup>4</sup>So he went his way and conferred with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray Him to them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_22_5"><sup>5</sup>And they were glad, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 11:12">⚓</a>agreed to give him money. </span>
