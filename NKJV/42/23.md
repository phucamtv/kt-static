<div class="title"><h1>23</h1><h3>Jesus Handed Over to Pontius Pilate</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_23_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:2; Mark 15:1; Luke 18:32; John 18:28">⚓</a>the whole multitude of them arose and led Him to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 3:1; 13:1">⚓</a>Pilate. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_2"><sup>2</sup>And they began to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 24:2">⚓</a>accuse Him, saying, “We found this <i>fellow</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 17:7">⚓</a>perverting the nation, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:27; Mark 12:17">⚓</a>forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 19:12">⚓</a>that He Himself is Christ, a King.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_3"> <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:11; 1 Tim. 6:13">⚓</a>Then Pilate asked Him, saying, “Are You the King of the Jews?”<br/> He answered him and said, <font color="red">“<i>It is as</i> you say.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_4"> <sup>4</sup>So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:19; (1 Pet. 2:22)">⚓</a>“I find no fault in this Man.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_5"> <sup>5</sup>But they were the more fierce, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:41">⚓</a>Galilee to this place.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Faces Herod</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_23_6"> <sup>6</sup>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the Man were a Galilean. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_7"><sup>7</sup>And as soon as he knew that He belonged to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:1; Mark 6:14; Luke 3:1; 9:7; 13:31">⚓</a>Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_8"><sup>8</sup>Now when Herod saw Jesus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 9:9">⚓</a>he was exceedingly glad; for he had desired for a long <i>time</i> to see Him, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:1; Mark 6:14">⚓</a>he had heard many things about Him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_9"><sup>9</sup>Then he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:7; Matt. 27:12, 14; Mark 15:5; John 19:9">⚓</a>nothing. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_10"><sup>10</sup>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:3">⚓</a>Then Herod, with his men of war, treated Him with contempt and mocked <i>Him,</i> arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_12"><sup>12</sup>That very day <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:26, 27">⚓</a>Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity with each other.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Taking the Place of Barabbas</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_23_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:23; Mark 15:14; John 18:38">⚓</a>Then Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_14"><sup>14</sup>said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:1, 2">⚓</a>“You have brought this Man to me, as one who misleads the people. And indeed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:4">⚓</a>having examined <i>Him</i> in your presence, I have found no fault in this Man concerning those things of which you accuse Him; </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_15"><sup>15</sup>no, neither did Herod, for I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing deserving of death has been done by Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:26; Mark 15:15; Luke 23:22; John 19:1; Acts 16:37">⚓</a>I will therefore chastise Him and release <i>Him</i>” </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:15; Mark 15:6; John 18:39">⚓</a>(for it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast).<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_18"> <sup>18</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:3; Acts 3:13–15">⚓</a>they all cried out at once, saying, “Away with this <i>Man,</i> and release to us Barabbas”— </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_19"><sup>19</sup>who had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion made in the city, and for murder.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_20"> <sup>20</sup>Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_21"><sup>21</sup>But they shouted, saying, “Crucify <i>Him,</i> crucify Him!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then he said to them the third time, “Why, what evil has He done? I have found no reason for death in Him. I will therefore chastise Him and let <i>Him</i> go.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_23"> <sup>23</sup>But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And the voices of these men and of the chief priests prevailed. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_24"><sup>24</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:26; Mark 15:15; John 19:16">⚓</a>Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they requested. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_25"><sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:8">⚓</a>And he released to them the one they requested, who for rebellion and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The King on a Cross</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_23_26"> <sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:32; Mark 15:21; John 19:17">⚓</a>Now as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross that he might bear <i>it</i> after Jesus.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_27"> <sup>27</sup>And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also mourned and lamented Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_28"><sup>28</sup>But Jesus, turning to them, said, <font color="red">“Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_29"><sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 24:19; Luke 21:23">⚓</a><font color="red">For indeed the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed <i>are</i> the barren, wombs that never bore, and breasts which never nursed!’</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_30"><sup>30</sup><font color="red">Then they will begin </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 2:19; Hos. 10:8; Rev. 6:16, 17; 9:6">⚓</a><font color="red">‘to say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” and to the hills, “Cover us!” ’</font></span>

<span class="verse lu_23_32"> <sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:9, 12; Matt. 27:38; Mark 15:27; John 19:18">⚓</a>There were also two others, criminals, led with Him to be put to death. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_33"><sup>33</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:16–18; Matt. 27:33–44; Mark 15:22–32; John 19:17–24">⚓</a>when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_34"><sup>34</sup>Then Jesus said, <font color="red">“Father, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 109:4; (Matt. 5:44); Acts 7:60; 1 Cor. 4:12">⚓</a><font color="red">forgive them, for </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:17">⚓</a><font color="red">they do not know what they do.”</font><br/> And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:18; Matt. 27:35; Mark 15:24; John 19:23">⚓</a>they divided His garments and cast lots. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_35"><sup>35</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:17; (Zech. 12:10)">⚓</a>the people stood looking on. But even the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:8; Matt. 27:39; Mark 15:29">⚓</a>rulers with them sneered, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_36"> <sup>36</sup>The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:21">⚓</a>sour wine, </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_37"><sup>37</sup>and saying, “If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_38"> <sup>38</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:37; Mark 15:26; John 19:19">⚓</a>And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew:<br/> <aside style="text-align:center;">THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</aside><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_39"> <sup>39</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:44; Mark 15:32">⚓</a>Then one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, “If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_40"> <sup>40</sup>But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_41"><sup>41</sup>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 7:26; 1 Pet. 2:21–24)">⚓</a>nothing wrong.” </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_42"><sup>42</sup>Then he said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_23_43"> <sup>43</sup>And Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 12:4; Eph. 4:8–10; Rev. 2:7)">⚓</a><font color="red">Paradise.”</font><br/></span>

<span class="verse lu_23_45"><sup>45</sup>Then the sun was darkened, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 26:31–33; Zech. 11:10; Matt. 27:51; Mark 15:38; (Heb. 9:3; 10:19, 20)">⚓</a>the veil of the temple was torn in two. </span>
<span class="verse lu_23_46"><sup>46</sup>And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said, <font color="red">“Father, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 31:5; 1 Pet. 2:23">⚓</a><font color="red">‘into Your hands I commit My spirit.’ ”</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:26; Zech. 11:10, 11; Matt. 27:50; Mark 15:37; Luke 9:22; 18:33; John 19:30">⚓</a>Having said this, He breathed His last.<br/></span>
