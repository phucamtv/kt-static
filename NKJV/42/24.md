<span class="verse lu_24_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:1–8; Mark 16:1–8; John 20:1–8">⚓</a>on the first <i>day</i> of the week, very early in the morning, they, and certain <i>other</i> <i>women</i> with them, came to the tomb <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:56">⚓</a>bringing the spices which they had prepared. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:2; Mark 16:4">⚓</a>But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:5">⚓</a>Then they went in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_4"><sup>4</sup>And it happened, as they were greatly perplexed about this, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 20:12; Acts 1:10">⚓</a>behold, two men stood by them in shining garments. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_5"><sup>5</sup>Then, as they were afraid and bowed <i>their</i> faces to the earth, they said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_6"><sup>6</sup>He is not here, but is risen! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:21; Mark 8:31; Luke 9:22">⚓</a>Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee, </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_7"><sup>7</sup>saying, <font color="red">‘The Son of Man must be </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 6:1, 2; Luke 9:44; 11:29, 30; 18:31–33">⚓</a><font color="red">delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.’</font> ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_8"> <sup>8</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 9:22, 44; John 2:19–22">⚓</a>they remembered His words. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:8; Mark 16:10">⚓</a>Then they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_10"><sup>10</sup>It was Mary Magdalene, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 8:3">⚓</a>Joanna, Mary <i>the</i> <i>mother</i> of James, and the other <i>women</i> with them, who told these things to the apostles. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:25">⚓</a>And their words seemed to them like idle tales, and they did not believe them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 20:3–6">⚓</a>But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying by themselves; and he departed, marveling to himself at what had happened.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Road to Emmaus</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_24_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:12">⚓</a>Now behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was seven miles from Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_14"><sup>14</sup>And they talked together of all these things which had happened. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_15"><sup>15</sup>So it was, while they conversed and reasoned, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 18:20)">⚓</a>Jesus Himself drew near and went with them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_16"><sup>16</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 20:14; 21:4">⚓</a>their eyes were restrained, so that they did not know Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_17"> <sup>17</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“What kind of conversation <i>is</i> this that you have with one another as you walk and are sad?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then the one <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 19:25">⚓</a>whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, “Are You the only stranger in Jerusalem, and have You not known the things which happened there in these days?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_19"> <sup>19</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“What things?”</font><br/> So they said to Him, “The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:11; Luke 7:16; John 3:2; Acts 2:22">⚓</a>who was a Prophet <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:22">⚓</a>mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:1; Acts 13:27, 28">⚓</a>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and crucified Him. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_21"><sup>21</sup>But we were hoping <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:68; 2:38; (Acts 1:6)">⚓</a>that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_22"><sup>22</sup>Yes, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:8; Mark 16:10; Luke 24:9, 10">⚓</a>certain women of our company, who arrived at the tomb early, astonished us. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_23"><sup>23</sup>When they did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He was alive. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_24"><sup>24</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:12">⚓</a>certain of those <i>who</i> <i>were</i> with us went to the tomb and found <i>it</i> just as the women had said; but Him they did not see.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then He said to them, <font color="red">“O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_26"><sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 17:2, 3; (Heb. 2:9, 10)">⚓</a><font color="red">Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Pet. 1:10–12)">⚓</a><font color="red">glory?”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_27"><sup>27</sup>And beginning at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 3:15; 12:3; Num. 21:9; Deut. 18:15); John 5:46">⚓</a>Moses and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 16:9, 10; 22; 132:11; Is. 7:14; 9:6; Jer. 23:5; 33:14, 15; Ezek. 34:23; 37:25; Dan. 9:24); Mic. 7:20; (Mal. 3:1; 4:2); John 1:45; 5:39; (Rom. 1:1–6)">⚓</a>all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Disciples’ Eyes Opened</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_24_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then they drew near to the village where they were going, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 32:26; 42:7; Mark 6:48">⚓</a>He indicated that He would have gone farther. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_29"><sup>29</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:2, 3; Acts 16:15">⚓</a>they constrained Him, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 14:23)">⚓</a>“Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.” And He went in to stay with them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_30"> <sup>30</sup>Now it came to pass, as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:19; Mark 8:6; Luke 9:16">⚓</a>He sat at the table with them, that He took bread, blessed and broke <i>it,</i> and gave it to them. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_31"><sup>31</sup>Then their eyes were opened and they knew Him; and He vanished from their sight.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_32"> <sup>32</sup>And they said to one another, “Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us on the road, and while He opened the Scriptures to us?” </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_33"><sup>33</sup>So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven and those <i>who</i> <i>were</i> with them gathered together, </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_34"><sup>34</sup>saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:5">⚓</a>has appeared to Simon!” </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_35"><sup>35</sup>And they told about the things <i>that</i> <i>had</i> <i>happened</i> on the road, and how He was known to them in the breaking of bread.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Appears to His Disciples</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_24_36"> <sup>36</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:14; John 20:19; 1 Cor. 15:5">⚓</a>Now as they said these things, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, <font color="red">“Peace to you.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_37"><sup>37</sup>But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed they had seen <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:26; Mark 6:49">⚓</a>a spirit. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_38"><sup>38</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_39"><sup>39</sup><font color="red">Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 20:20, 27; 1 John 1:1">⚓</a><font color="red">Handle Me and see, for a </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 15:50)">⚓</a><font color="red">spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_40"> <sup>40</sup>When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_41"><sup>41</sup>But while they still did not believe <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:26">⚓</a>for joy, and marveled, He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 21:5">⚓</a><font color="red">“Have you any food here?”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_42"><sup>42</sup>So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb. </span>
<span class="verse lu_24_43"><sup>43</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:39–41">⚓</a>And He took <i>it</i> and ate in their presence.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Scriptures Opened</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_24_44"> <sup>44</sup>Then He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:21; 17:22; 20:18; Mark 8:31; Luke 9:22; 18:31">⚓</a><font color="red">“These <i>are</i> the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and <i>the</i> Prophets and <i>the</i> Psalms concerning Me.”</font></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_45"><sup>45</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:14; 1 John 5:20">⚓</a>He opened their understanding, that they might comprehend the Scriptures.<br/></span>
<span class="verse lu_24_46"> <sup>46</sup>Then He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22; Hos. 6:2; Luke 11:29, 30; Acts 17:3">⚓</a><font color="red">“Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,</font></span>

<div class="title"><h3>The Ascension</h3></div>
<span class="verse lu_24_50"> <sup>50</sup>And He led them out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:17; Acts 1:12">⚓</a>as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them. </span>
