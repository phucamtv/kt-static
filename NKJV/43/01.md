<div class="title"><h3>John’s Witness: The True Light</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_1_6"> <sup>6</sup>There was a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 3:1; Matt. 3:1–17; Mark 1:1–11; Luke 3:1–22">⚓</a>man sent from God, whose name <i>was</i> John. </span>

<span class="verse gi_1_8"><sup>8</sup>He was not that Light, but <i>was</i> <i>sent</i> to bear witness of that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 9:2; 49:6">⚓</a>Light. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 49:6">⚓</a>That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_10"> <sup>10</sup>He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:27; 1 Cor. 8:6; Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:2">⚓</a>the world did not know Him. </span>

<div class="title"><h3>The Word Becomes Flesh</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_1_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:16; Rev. 19:13">⚓</a>And the Word <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:3; Gal. 4:4; Phil. 2:7; 1 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 2:14; 1 John 1:1; 4:2; 2 John 7">⚓</a>became <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 2:11">⚓</a>flesh and dwelt among us, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 40:5; 2 Pet. 1:16–18">⚓</a>we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 8:32; 14:6; 18:37); Col. 1:19">⚓</a>full of grace and truth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 3:1; John 3:32">⚓</a>John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 3:11)">⚓</a>‘He who comes after me is preferred before me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Col. 1:17)">⚓</a>for He was before me.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_16"> <sup>16</sup>And of His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 1:23; 3:19; 4:13; Col. 1:19; 2:9)">⚓</a>fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. </span>

<div class="title"><h3>A Voice in the Wilderness</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_1_19"> <sup>19</sup>Now this is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 5:33">⚓</a>the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_20"> <sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 3:15; John 3:28; Acts 13:25">⚓</a>He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_21"> <sup>21</sup>And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?”<br/> He said, “I am not.”<br/> “Are you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 18:15, 18; Matt. 21:11; John 6:14; 7:40">⚓</a>the Prophet?”<br/> And he answered, “No.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then they said to him, “Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_23"> <sup>23</sup>He said: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:3">⚓</a>“I <i>am</i><br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 40:3; Mal. 3:1">⚓</a>‘The voice of one crying in the wilderness:<br/>   “Make straight the way of the LORD,” ’<br/> as the prophet Isaiah said.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_24"> <sup>24</sup>Now those who were sent were from the Pharisees. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_25"><sup>25</sup>And they asked him, saying, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_26"> <sup>26</sup>John answered them, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:11; (Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16; Acts 1:5)">⚓</a>“I baptize with water, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 3:1; John 4:10; 8:19; 9:30; Acts 13:27">⚓</a>but there stands One among you whom you do not know. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 3:31); Acts 19:4; (Col. 1:17)">⚓</a>It is He who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_28"> <sup>28</sup>These things were done <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 7:24">⚓</a>in Bethabara beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Lamb of God</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_1_29"> <sup>29</sup>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 12:3); Acts 8:32; (1 Pet. 1:19); Rev. 5:6–14">⚓</a>The Lamb of God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 53:11; 1 Cor. 15:3; Gal. 1:4; 1 Pet. 2:24; 1 John 2:2; Rev. 1:5)">⚓</a>who takes away the sin of the world! </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_30"><sup>30</sup>This is He of whom I said, ‘After me comes a Man who is preferred before me, for He was before me.’ </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_31"><sup>31</sup>I did not know Him; but that He should be revealed to Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 3:1; Matt. 3:6">⚓</a>therefore I came baptizing with water.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_32"> <sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 42:1; 61:1; Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22">⚓</a>And John bore witness, saying, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and He remained upon Him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_33"><sup>33</sup>I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘Upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:11; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16; Acts 1:5">⚓</a>this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_34"><sup>34</sup>And I have seen and testified that this is the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:7; Luke 1:35; John 11:27">⚓</a>Son of God.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The First Disciples</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_1_35"> <sup>35</sup>Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_36"><sup>36</sup>And looking at Jesus as He walked, he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:29">⚓</a>“Behold the Lamb of God!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_37"> <sup>37</sup>The two disciples heard him speak, and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:20, 22">⚓</a>followed Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_38"><sup>38</sup>Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, <font color="red">“What do you seek?”</font><br/> They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, when translated, Teacher), “where are You staying?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_39"> <sup>39</sup>He said to them, <font color="red">“Come and see.”</font> They came and saw where He was staying, and remained with Him that day (now it was about the tenth hour).<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_40"> <sup>40</sup>One of the two who heard John <i>speak,</i> and followed Him, was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:18; Mark 1:29; 13:3; John 6:8; 12:22">⚓</a>Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_41"><sup>41</sup>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated, the Christ). </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_42"><sup>42</sup>And he brought him to Jesus.<br/> Now when Jesus looked at him, He said, <font color="red">“You are Simon the son of Jonah.</font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:18">⚓</a><font color="red">You shall be called Cephas”</font> (which is translated, A Stone).<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Philip and Nathanael</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_1_43"> <sup>43</sup>The following day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee, and He found <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:3; John 6:5; 12:21, 22; 14:8, 9">⚓</a>Philip and said to him, <font color="red">“Follow Me.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_44"><sup>44</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:21">⚓</a>Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. </span>
<span class="verse gi_1_45"><sup>45</sup>Philip found <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 21:2">⚓</a>Nathanael and said to him, “We have found Him of whom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 3:15; Deut. 18:18); Luke 24:27">⚓</a>Moses in the law, and also the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 4:2; 7:14; 9:6; Mic. 5:2; Zech. 6:12); Luke 24:27">⚓</a>prophets, wrote—Jesus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 2:23); Luke 2:4">⚓</a>of Nazareth, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 3:23">⚓</a>son of Joseph.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_46"> <sup>46</sup>And Nathanael said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:41, 42, 52">⚓</a>“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?”<br/> Philip said to him, “Come and see.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_47"> <sup>47</sup>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said of him, <font color="red">“Behold, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 32:2; 73:1">⚓</a><font color="red">an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_48"> <sup>48</sup>Nathanael said to Him, “How do You know me?”<br/> Jesus answered and said to him, <font color="red">“Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_49"> <sup>49</sup>Nathanael answered and said to Him, “Rabbi, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:7; Matt. 14:33; Luke 1:35">⚓</a>You are the Son of God! You are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:5">⚓</a>the King of Israel!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_50"> <sup>50</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, <font color="red">“Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_1_51"><sup>51</sup>And He said to him, <font color="red">“Most assuredly, I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 28:12; (Luke 2:9, 13); Acts 1:10; 7:55, 56">⚓</a><font color="red">hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”</font><br/></span>
