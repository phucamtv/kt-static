<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Water Turned to Wine</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>On the third day there was a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 13:4)">⚓</a>wedding in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:46">⚓</a>Cana of Galilee, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 19:25">⚓</a>mother of Jesus was there. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_2"><sup>2</sup>Now both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_3"><sup>3</sup>And when they ran out of wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, “They have no wine.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_4"> <sup>4</sup>Jesus said to her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 19:26">⚓</a><font color="red">“Woman, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 16:10">⚓</a><font color="red">what does your concern have to do with Me? </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:6, 8, 30; 8:20">⚓</a><font color="red">My hour has not yet come.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>His mother said to the servants, “Whatever He says to you, do <i>it.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now there were set there six waterpots of stone, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:2; (Mark 7:3; Luke 11:39); John 3:25">⚓</a>according to the manner of purification of the Jews, containing twenty or thirty gallons apiece. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_7"><sup>7</sup>Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Fill the waterpots with water.”</font> And they filled them up to the brim. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_8"><sup>8</sup>And He said to them, <font color="red">“Draw <i>some</i> out now, and take <i>it</i> to the master of the feast.”</font> And they took <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_9"><sup>9</sup>When the master of the feast had tasted <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:46">⚓</a>the water that was made wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_10"><sup>10</sup>And he said to him, “Every man at the beginning sets out the good wine, and when the <i>guests</i> have well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_11"> <sup>11</sup>This <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:54">⚓</a>beginning of signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:14)">⚓</a>and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_12"> <sup>12</sup>After this He went down to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:13; John 4:46">⚓</a>Capernaum, He, His mother, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:46; 13:55">⚓</a>His brothers, and His disciples; and they did not stay there many days.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Cleanses the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_2_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:14; Deut. 16:1–6; John 5:1; 6:4; 11:55">⚓</a>Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 3:1; Matt. 21:12; Mark 11:15, 17; Luke 19:45">⚓</a>And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers doing business. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_15"><sup>15</sup>When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money and overturned the tables. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_16"><sup>16</sup>And He said to those who sold doves, <font color="red">“Take these things away! Do not make </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:49">⚓</a><font color="red">My Father’s house a house of merchandise!”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_17"><sup>17</sup>Then His disciples remembered that it was written, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:9">⚓</a>“Zeal for Your house has eaten Me up.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_18"> <sup>18</sup>So the Jews answered and said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:38; John 6:30">⚓</a>“What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_19"> <sup>19</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:61; 27:40; (Mark 14:58; 15:29); Luke 24:46; Acts 6:14; 10:40; 1 Cor. 15:4">⚓</a><font color="red">“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then the Jews said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_21"> <sup>21</sup>But He was speaking <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16; Col. 2:9; Heb. 8:2)">⚓</a>of the temple of His body. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_22"><sup>22</sup>Therefore, when He had risen from the dead, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:8; John 2:17; 12:16; 14:26">⚓</a>His disciples remembered that He had said this to them; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Discerner of Hearts</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_2_23"> <sup>23</sup>Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name when they saw the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 5:36; Acts 2:22)">⚓</a>signs which He did. </span>
<span class="verse gi_2_24"><sup>24</sup>But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:4; John 16:30; Rev. 2:23">⚓</a>knew all <i>men,</i></span>
<span class="verse gi_2_25"><sup>25</sup>and had no need that anyone should testify of man, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:7; 1 Chr. 28:9; Matt. 9:4; (Mark 2:8); John 6:64; 16:30; Acts 1:24; Rev. 2:23">⚓</a>He knew what was in man.<br/></span>
