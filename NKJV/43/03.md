<span class="verse gi_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. </span>
<span class="verse gi_3_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:50; 19:39">⚓</a>This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 9:16, 33; Acts 2:22">⚓</a>no one can do these signs that You do unless <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 10:38)">⚓</a>God is with him.”<br/></span>

<span class="verse gi_3_4"> <sup>4</sup>Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_3_5"> <sup>5</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“Most assuredly, I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:16; (Acts 2:38)">⚓</a><font color="red">unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</font></span>
