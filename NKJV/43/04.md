<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>A Samaritan Woman Meets Her Messiah</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:22, 26; 1 Cor. 1:17">⚓</a>baptized more disciples than John </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_2"><sup>2</sup>(though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples), </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_3"><sup>3</sup>He left Judea and departed again to Galilee. </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_4"><sup>4</sup>But He needed to go through Samaria.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_5"> <sup>5</sup>So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 33:19; Josh. 24:32">⚓</a>Jacob <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:22; Josh. 4:12">⚓</a>gave to his son Joseph. </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_6"><sup>6</sup>Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from <i>His</i> journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_7"> <sup>7</sup>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, <font color="red">“Give Me a drink.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_8"><sup>8</sup>For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, “How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:28">⚓</a>Jews have no dealings with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:24; Matt. 10:5, 6; Luke 9:52; 10:33; 17:16; John 8:48">⚓</a>Samaritans.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_10"> <sup>10</sup>Jesus answered and said to her, <font color="red">“If you knew the </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 5:15)">⚓</a><font color="red">gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 12:3; 44:3; Jer. 2:13; Zech. 13:1; 14:8; John 7:38">⚓</a><font color="red">living water.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_11"> <sup>11</sup>The woman said to Him, “Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water? </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_12"><sup>12</sup>Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>Jesus answered and said to her, <font color="red">“Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again,</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_14"><sup>14</sup><font color="red">but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 6:35, 58)">⚓</a><font color="red">whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:37, 38">⚓</a><font color="red">will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 6:34, 35; 17:2, 3; (Rom. 6:23; 1 John 5:20)">⚓</a>The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_16"> <sup>16</sup>Jesus said to her, <font color="red">“Go, call your husband, and come here.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_17"> <sup>17</sup>The woman answered and said, “I have no husband.”<br/> Jesus said to her, <font color="red">“You have well said, ‘I have no husband,’</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_18"><sup>18</sup><font color="red">for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; in that you spoke truly.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_19"> <sup>19</sup>The woman said to Him, “Sir, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:11; Luke 7:16, 39; 24:19; John 6:14; 7:40; 9:17">⚓</a>I perceive that You are a prophet. </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_20"><sup>20</sup>Our fathers worshiped on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 12:6–8; 33:18, 20; Judg. 9:7">⚓</a>this mountain, and you <i>Jews</i> say that in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 12:5, 11; 1 Kin. 9:3; 2 Chr. 7:12; Ps. 122:1–9">⚓</a>Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_21"> <sup>21</sup>Jesus said to her, <font color="red">“Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mal. 1:11); 1 Tim. 2:8">⚓</a><font color="red">when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">You worship </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Kin. 17:28–41)">⚓</a><font color="red">what you do not know; we know what we worship, for </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 2:3; Luke 24:47; Rom. 3:1; 9:4, 5)">⚓</a><font color="red">salvation is of the Jews.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:20; (Heb. 13:10–14)">⚓</a><font color="red">worship the Father in </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 3:3">⚓</a><font color="red">spirit </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:17)">⚓</a><font color="red">and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 3:17">⚓</a><font color="red">God <i>is</i> Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_25"> <sup>25</sup>The woman said to Him, “I know that Messiah <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 18:15">⚓</a>is coming” (who is called Christ). “When He comes, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:29, 39">⚓</a>He will tell us all things.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_26"> <sup>26</sup>Jesus said to her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:25; Matt. 26:63, 64; Mark 14:61, 62">⚓</a><font color="red">“I who speak to you am <i>He.</i>”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Whitened Harvest</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_4_27"> <sup>27</sup>And at this <i>point</i> His disciples came, and they marveled that He talked with a woman; yet no one said, “What do You seek?” or, “Why are You talking with her?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_28"> <sup>28</sup>The woman then left her waterpot, went her way into the city, and said to the men, </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_29"><sup>29</sup>“Come, see a Man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:25">⚓</a>who told me all things that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?” </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_30"><sup>30</sup>Then they went out of the city and came to Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_31"> <sup>31</sup>In the meantime His disciples urged Him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_32"> <sup>32</sup>But He said to them, <font color="red">“I have food to eat of which you do not know.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_33"> <sup>33</sup>Therefore the disciples said to one another, “Has anyone brought Him <i>anything</i> to eat?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_34"> <sup>34</sup>Jesus said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 40:7, 8; Heb. 10:9">⚓</a><font color="red">“My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 23:12; (John 6:38; 17:4; 19:30)">⚓</a><font color="red">finish His work.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_35"><sup>35</sup><font color="red">Do you not say, ‘There are still four months and <i>then</i> comes </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 8:22">⚓</a><font color="red">the harvest’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:37; Luke 10:2">⚓</a><font color="red">for they are already white for harvest!</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_36"><sup>36</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 12:3; Rom. 6:22">⚓</a><font color="red">And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, that </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 2:19">⚓</a><font color="red">both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_37"><sup>37</sup><font color="red">For in this the saying is true: </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 3:5–9">⚓</a><font color="red">‘One sows and another reaps.’</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_38"><sup>38</sup><font color="red">I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 44:4; (1 Pet. 1:12)">⚓</a><font color="red">others have labored, and you have entered into their labors.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Savior of the World</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_4_39"> <sup>39</sup>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:29">⚓</a>because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me all that I <i>ever</i> did.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_40"><sup>40</sup>So when the Samaritans had come to Him, they urged Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_41"><sup>41</sup>And many more believed because of His own <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:32; (John 6:63)">⚓</a>word.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_42"> <sup>42</sup>Then they said to the woman, “Now we believe, not because of what you said, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 17:8; 1 John 4:14">⚓</a>we ourselves have heard <i>Him</i> and we know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Welcome at Galilee</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_4_43"> <sup>43</sup>Now after the two days He departed from there and went to Galilee. </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_44"><sup>44</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:57; Mark 6:4; Luke 4:24">⚓</a>Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country. </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_45"><sup>45</sup>So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 2:13, 23; 3:2">⚓</a>having seen all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 16:16">⚓</a>for they also had gone to the feast.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Nobleman’s Son Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_4_46"> <sup>46</sup>So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 2:1, 11">⚓</a>where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum. </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_47"><sup>47</sup>When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and implored Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_48"><sup>48</sup>Then Jesus said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 6:30; Rom. 15:19; 1 Cor. 1:22; 2 Cor. 12:12; (2 Thess. 2:9); Heb. 2:4">⚓</a><font color="red">“Unless you <i>people</i> see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_49"> <sup>49</sup>The nobleman said to Him, “Sir, come down before my child dies!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_50"> <sup>50</sup>Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Go your way; your son lives.”</font> So the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way. </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_51"><sup>51</sup>And as he was now going down, his servants met him and told <i>him,</i> saying, “Your son lives!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_52"> <sup>52</sup>Then he inquired of them the hour when he got better. And they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_4_53"><sup>53</sup>So the father knew that <i>it</i> <i>was</i> at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Your son lives.”</font> And he himself believed, and his whole household.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_4_54"> <sup>54</sup>This again <i>is</i> the second sign Jesus did when He had come out of Judea into Galilee.<br/></span>
