<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>A Man Healed at the Pool of Bethesda</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>After <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:2; Deut. 16:16">⚓</a>this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 2:13">⚓</a>went up to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_2"><sup>2</sup>Now there is in Jerusalem <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 3:1, 32; 12:39">⚓</a>by the Sheep <i>Gate</i> a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_3"><sup>3</sup>In these lay a great multitude of sick people, blind, lame, paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_4"><sup>4</sup>For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and stirred up the water; then whoever stepped in first, after the stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_5"><sup>5</sup>Now a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_6"><sup>6</sup>When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he already had been <i>in</i> <i>that</i> <i>condition</i> a long time, He said to him, <font color="red">“Do you want to be made well?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_7"> <sup>7</sup>The sick man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_8"> <sup>8</sup>Jesus said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:6; Mark 2:11; Luke 5:24">⚓</a><font color="red">“Rise, take up your bed and walk.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_9"><sup>9</sup>And immediately the man was made well, took up his bed, and walked.<br/> And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 9:14">⚓</a>that day was the Sabbath. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_10"><sup>10</sup>The Jews therefore said to him who was cured, “It is the Sabbath; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:10; Neh. 13:19; Jer. 17:21, 22; Matt. 12:2; Mark 2:24; Luke 6:2">⚓</a>it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_11"> <sup>11</sup>He answered them, “He who made me well said to me, <font color="red">‘Take up your bed and walk.’</font> ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then they asked him, “Who is the Man who said to you, <font color="red">‘Take up your bed and walk’</font>?” </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_13"><sup>13</sup>But the one who was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 13:14; 22:51">⚓</a>healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a multitude being in <i>that</i> place. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_14"><sup>14</sup>Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, <font color="red">“See, you have been made well. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:45; (Mark 2:5); John 8:11">⚓</a><font color="red">Sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon you.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_15"> <sup>15</sup>The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Honor the Father and the Son</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_5_16"> <sup>16</sup>For this reason the Jews <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:29; John 8:37; 10:39">⚓</a>persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_17"><sup>17</sup>But Jesus answered them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 9:4; 17:4)">⚓</a><font color="red">“My Father has been working until now, and I have been working.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_18"> <sup>18</sup>Therefore the Jews <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:1, 19">⚓</a>sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 10:30; Phil. 2:6">⚓</a>making Himself equal with God. </span>
<span class="verse gi_5_19"><sup>19</sup>Then Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“Most assuredly, I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:39; John 5:30; 6:38; 8:28; 12:49; 14:10">⚓</a><font color="red">the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner.</font></span>

<span class="verse gi_5_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to <i>them,</i></font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:14; 8:54; (John 11:25)">⚓</a><font color="red">even so the Son gives life to whom He will.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_22"><sup>22</sup><font color="red">For the Father judges no one, but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:27; 28:18; (John 3:35; 17:2; Acts 17:31; 1 Pet. 4:5)">⚓</a><font color="red">has committed all judgment to the Son,</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_5_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:16; 1 John 2:23">⚓</a><font color="red">He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.</font><br/></span>
