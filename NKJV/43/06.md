<span class="verse gi_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>After <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:13; Mark 6:32; Luke 9:10, 12">⚓</a>these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, which is <i>the</i> <i>Sea</i> of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 6:23; 21:1">⚓</a>Tiberias. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_2"><sup>2</sup>Then a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His signs which He performed on those who were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:23; 8:16; 9:35; 14:36; 15:30; 19:2">⚓</a>diseased. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_3"><sup>3</sup>And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat with His disciples.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:5, 7; Deut. 16:1; John 2:13">⚓</a>Now the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was near. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:14; Mark 6:35; Luke 9:12">⚓</a>Then Jesus lifted up <i>His</i> eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward Him, He said to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:43">⚓</a>Philip, <font color="red">“Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_6"><sup>6</sup>But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_7"> <sup>7</sup>Philip answered Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:21, 22">⚓</a>“Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may have a little.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_8"> <sup>8</sup>One of His disciples, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:40">⚓</a>Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him, </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_9"><sup>9</sup>“There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:43">⚓</a>but what are they among so many?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Jesus said, <font color="red">“Make the people sit down.”</font> Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_11"><sup>11</sup>And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks He distributed <i>them</i> to the disciples, and the disciples to those sitting down; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wanted. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_12"><sup>12</sup>So when they were filled, He said to His disciples, <font color="red">“Gather up the fragments that remain, so that nothing is lost.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_13"><sup>13</sup>Therefore they gathered <i>them</i> up, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_14"><sup>14</sup>Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, “This is truly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:10; Deut. 18:15, 18; John 1:21; 7:40; Acts 3:22; 7:37">⚓</a>the Prophet who is to come into the world.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Walks on the Sea</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_6_15"> <sup>15</sup>Therefore when Jesus perceived that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 18:36)">⚓</a>king, He departed again to the mountain by Himself alone.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:23; Mark 6:47">⚓</a>Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_17"><sup>17</sup>got into the boat, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was already dark, and Jesus had not come to them. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_18"><sup>18</sup>Then the sea arose because a great wind was blowing. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_19"><sup>19</sup>So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:6">⚓</a>afraid. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_20"><sup>20</sup>But He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 43:1, 2">⚓</a><font color="red">“It is I; do not be afraid.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_21"><sup>21</sup>Then they willingly received Him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Bread from Heaven</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_6_22"> <sup>22</sup>On the following day, when the people who were standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except that one which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone— </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_23"><sup>23</sup>however, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks— </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_24"><sup>24</sup>when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they also got into boats and came to Capernaum, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:37; Luke 4:42">⚓</a>seeking Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse gi_6_25"><sup>25</sup>And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, “Rabbi, when did You come here?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_26"> <sup>26</sup>Jesus answered them and said, <font color="red">“Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 6:19">⚓</a><font color="red">Do not labor for the food which perishes, but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:14; (Eph. 2:8, 9)">⚓</a><font color="red">for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:7; Is. 42:1; Matt. 3:17; 17:5; Mark 1:11; 9:7; Luke 3:22; 9:35; John 5:37; Acts 2:22; 2 Pet. 1:17">⚓</a><font color="red">because God the Father has set His seal on Him.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then they said to Him, “What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_29"> <sup>29</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 1:3; James 2:22; (1 John 3:23); Rev. 2:26">⚓</a><font color="red">“This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_6_30"> <sup>30</sup>Therefore they said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:38; 16:1; Mark 8:11; 1 Cor. 1:22">⚓</a>“What sign will You perform then, that we may see it and believe You? What work will You do? </span>

<span class="verse gi_6_32"> <sup>32</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Most assuredly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread from heaven, but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:13, 16">⚓</a><font color="red">My Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</font></span>

<span class="verse gi_6_34"> <sup>34</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:15">⚓</a>Then they said to Him, “Lord, give us this bread always.”<br/></span>

<div class="title"><h3>Rejected by His Own</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_6_41"> <sup>41</sup>The Jews then complained about Him, because He said, <font color="red">“I am the bread which came down from heaven.”</font></span>
