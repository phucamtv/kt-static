<span class="verse gi_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for He did not want to walk in Judea, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:38; 26:4; John 5:18; 7:19, 25; 8:37, 40">⚓</a>because the Jews sought to kill Him. </span>

<span class="verse gi_7_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:46; Mark 3:21; John 7:5, 10; Acts 1:14">⚓</a>His brothers therefore said to Him, “Depart from here and go into Judea, that Your disciples also may see the works that You are doing. </span>
<span class="verse gi_7_4"><sup>4</sup>For no one does anything in secret while he himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_7_5"><sup>5</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:8; Mic. 7:6">⚓</a>even His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:46; 13:55; Mark 3:21; John 7:3, 10">⚓</a>brothers did not believe in Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_7_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 2:4; 8:20">⚓</a><font color="red">“My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_7_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 15:19)">⚓</a><font color="red">The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:19">⚓</a><font color="red">because I testify of it that its works are evil.</font></span>

<span class="verse gi_7_9"><sup>9</sup>When He had said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Heavenly Scholar</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_7_10"> <sup>10</sup>But when His brothers had gone up, then He also went up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. </span>
<span class="verse gi_7_11"><sup>11</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:56">⚓</a>the Jews sought Him at the feast, and said, “Where is He?” </span>
<span class="verse gi_7_12"><sup>12</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 9:16; 10:19">⚓</a>there was much complaining among the people concerning Him. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:46; Luke 7:16; John 6:14; 7:40">⚓</a>Some said, “He is good”; others said, “No, on the contrary, He deceives the people.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_7_13"><sup>13</sup>However, no one spoke openly of Him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 9:22; 12:42; 19:38)">⚓</a>for fear of the Jews.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_7_14"> <sup>14</sup>Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:22; Matt. 4:23; 5:2; 7:29; Mark 6:34; Luke 4:15; 5:3; John 8:2">⚓</a>taught. </span>

<span class="verse gi_7_16"> <sup>16</sup>Jesus answered them and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 18:15, 18, 19; John 3:11">⚓</a><font color="red">“My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.</font></span>

<span class="verse gi_7_20"> <sup>20</sup>The people answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:48, 52">⚓</a>“You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill You?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_7_21"> <sup>21</sup>Jesus answered and said to them, <font color="red">“I did one work, and you all marvel.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_7_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 12:3">⚓</a><font color="red">Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:9–14; Acts 7:8">⚓</a><font color="red">but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_7_23"><sup>23</sup><font color="red">If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry with Me because </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 5:8, 9, 16">⚓</a><font color="red">I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_7_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:16; Prov. 24:23; John 8:15; James 2:1">⚓</a><font color="red">Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Could This Be the Christ?</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_7_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now some of them from Jerusalem said, “Is this not He whom they seek to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:38; 26:4; Luke 22:2; John 5:18; 8:37, 40">⚓</a>kill? </span>
<span class="verse gi_7_26"><sup>26</sup>But look! He speaks boldly, and they say nothing to Him. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:48">⚓</a>Do the rulers know indeed that this is truly the Christ? </span>

<span class="verse gi_7_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then Jesus cried out, as He taught in the temple, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:14">⚓</a><font color="red">“You both know Me, and you know where I am from; and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 5:43">⚓</a><font color="red">I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 3:4">⚓</a><font color="red">is true, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:18; 8:55">⚓</a><font color="red">whom you do not know.</font></span>

<span class="verse gi_7_30"> <sup>30</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 11:18">⚓</a>they sought to take Him; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:46; John 7:32, 44; 8:20; 10:39">⚓</a>no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. </span>
<span class="verse gi_7_31"><sup>31</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:23">⚓</a>many of the people believed in Him, and said, “When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than these which this <i>Man</i> has done?”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus and the Religious Leaders</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_7_32"> <sup>32</sup>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take Him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_7_33"><sup>33</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 13:33">⚓</a><font color="red">“I shall be with you a little while longer, and <i>then</i> I </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Mark 16:19; Luke 24:51; Acts 1:9; Heb. 9:24; 1 Pet. 3:22)">⚓</a><font color="red">go to Him who sent Me.</font></span>

<span class="verse gi_7_35"> <sup>35</sup>Then the Jews said among themselves, “Where does He intend to go that we shall not find Him? Does He intend to go to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 147:2; (Is. 11:12; 56:8; Zeph. 3:10); James 1:1; 1 Pet. 1:1">⚓</a>the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? </span>

<div class="title"><h3>Who Is He?</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_7_40"> <sup>40</sup>Therefore many from the crowd, when they heard this saying, said, “Truly this is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 18:15, 18">⚓</a>the Prophet.” </span>
