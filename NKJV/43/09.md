<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>A Man Born Blind Receives Sight</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now as <i>Jesus</i> passed by, He saw a man who was blind from birth. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_2"><sup>2</sup>And His disciples asked Him, saying, “Rabbi, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 13:2; John 9:34; Acts 28:4">⚓</a>who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_3"> <sup>3</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“Neither this man nor his parents sinned, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:4">⚓</a><font color="red">but that the works of God should be revealed in him.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 4:34; 5:19, 36; 17:4)">⚓</a><font color="red">I must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:9, 10; 12:35; Gal. 6:10">⚓</a><font color="red">day; <i>the</i> night is coming when no one can work.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_5"><sup>5</sup><font color="red">As long as I am in the world, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:5, 9; 3:19; 8:12; 12:35, 46)">⚓</a><font color="red">I am the light of the world.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_6"> <sup>6</sup>When He had said these things, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:33; 8:23">⚓</a>He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva; and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_7"><sup>7</sup>And He said to him, <font color="red">“Go, wash </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 3:15; Is. 8:6; Luke 13:4; John 9:11">⚓</a><font color="red">in the pool of Siloam”</font> (which is translated, Sent). So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 5:14">⚓</a>he went and washed, and came back seeing.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_8"> <sup>8</sup>Therefore the neighbors and those who previously had seen that he was blind said, “Is not this he who sat and begged?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_9"> <sup>9</sup>Some said, “This is he.” Others <i>said,</i> “He is like him.”<br/> He said, “I am <i>he.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_10"> <sup>10</sup>Therefore they said to him, “How were your eyes opened?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_11"> <sup>11</sup>He answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 9:6, 7">⚓</a>“A Man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, <font color="red">‘Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.’</font> So I went and washed, and I received sight.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then they said to him, “Where is He?”<br/> He said, “I do not know.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Pharisees Excommunicate the Healed Man</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_9_13"> <sup>13</sup>They brought him who formerly was blind to the Pharisees. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_14"><sup>14</sup>Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_15"><sup>15</sup>Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, “He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_16"> <sup>16</sup>Therefore some of the Pharisees said, “This Man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.”<br/> Others said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:2; 9:33">⚓</a>“How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:12, 43; 10:19">⚓</a>there was a division among them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_17"> <sup>17</sup>They said to the blind man again, “What do you say about Him because He opened your eyes?”<br/> He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 4:19; 6:14)">⚓</a>“He is a prophet.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_18"> <sup>18</sup>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind and received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_19"><sup>19</sup>And they asked them, saying, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_20"> <sup>20</sup>His parents answered them and said, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_21"><sup>21</sup>but by what means he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. He is of age; ask him. He will speak for himself.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_22"><sup>22</sup>His parents said these <i>things</i> because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:13; 12:42; 19:38; Acts 5:13">⚓</a>they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone confessed <i>that</i> He <i>was</i> Christ, he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 16:2">⚓</a>would be put out of the synagogue. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_23"><sup>23</sup>Therefore his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_24"> <sup>24</sup>So they again called the man who was blind, and said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 7:19; 1 Sam. 6:5; Ezra 10:11; Rev. 11:13">⚓</a>“Give God the glory! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 9:16">⚓</a>We know that this Man is a sinner.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_25"> <sup>25</sup>He answered and said, “Whether He is a sinner <i>or</i> <i>not</i> I do not know. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then they said to him again, “What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_27"> <sup>27</sup>He answered them, “I told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear <i>it</i> again? Do you also want to become His disciples?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then they reviled him and said, “You are His disciple, but we are Moses’ disciples. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_29"><sup>29</sup>We know that God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:19, 20; 33:11; 34:29; Num. 12:6–8">⚓</a>spoke to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 5:45–47)">⚓</a>Moses; <i>as</i> <i>for</i> this <i>fellow,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:27, 28; 8:14">⚓</a>we do not know where He is from.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_30"> <sup>30</sup>The man answered and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:10">⚓</a>“Why, this is a marvelous thing, that you do not know where He is from; yet He has opened my eyes! </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_31"><sup>31</sup>Now we know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 27:9; 35:12; Ps. 18:41; Prov. 1:28; 15:29; 28:9; Is. 1:15; Jer. 11:11; 14:12; Ezek. 8:18; Mic. 3:4; Zech. 7:13; (James 5:16)">⚓</a>God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_32"><sup>32</sup>Since the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of one who was born blind. </span>
<span class="verse gi_9_33"><sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:2; 9:16">⚓</a>If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_34"> <sup>34</sup>They answered and said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 51:5; John 9:2">⚓</a>“You were completely born in sins, and are you teaching us?” And they cast him out.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>True Vision and True Blindness</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_9_35"> <sup>35</sup>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 5:14">⚓</a>found him, He said to him, <font color="red">“Do you </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:7; 16:31">⚓</a><font color="red">believe in </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 14:33; 16:16; Mark 1:1; John 10:36; 1 John 5:13">⚓</a><font color="red">the Son of God?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_36"> <sup>36</sup>He answered and said, “Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_37"> <sup>37</sup>And Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“You have both seen Him and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:26">⚓</a><font color="red">it is He who is talking with you.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_38"> <sup>38</sup>Then he said, “Lord, I believe!” And he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:2">⚓</a>worshiped Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_39"> <sup>39</sup>And Jesus said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 3:17; 5:22, 27; 12:47)">⚓</a><font color="red">“For judgment I have come into this world, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:13; 15:14">⚓</a><font color="red">that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may be made blind.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_40"> <sup>40</sup>Then <i>some</i> of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 2:19)">⚓</a>and said to Him, “Are we blind also?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_9_41"> <sup>41</sup>Jesus said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 15:22, 24">⚓</a><font color="red">“If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.</font><br/></span>
