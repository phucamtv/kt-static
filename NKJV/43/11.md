<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>The Death of Lazarus</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now a certain <i>man</i> was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:38, 39; John 11:5, 19">⚓</a>Mary and her sister Martha. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:7">⚓</a>It was <i>that</i> Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_3"><sup>3</sup>Therefore the sisters sent to Him, saying, “Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_4"> <sup>4</sup>When Jesus heard <i>that,</i> He said, <font color="red">“This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_5"> <sup>5</sup>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_6"><sup>6</sup>So, when He heard that he was sick, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 10:40">⚓</a>He stayed two more days in the place where He was. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_7"><sup>7</sup>Then after this He said to <i>the</i> disciples, <font color="red">“Let us go to Judea again.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_8"> <sup>8</sup><i>The</i> disciples said to Him, “Rabbi, lately the Jews sought to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:59; 10:31">⚓</a>stone You, and are You going there again?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_9"> <sup>9</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“Are there not twelve hours in the day? </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 13:33; John 9:4; 12:35">⚓</a><font color="red">If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 9:2">⚓</a><font color="red">light of this world.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_10"><sup>10</sup><font color="red">But </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:35">⚓</a><font color="red">if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_11"><sup>11</sup>These things He said, and after that He said to them, <font color="red">“Our friend Lazarus </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:16; (Dan. 12:2); Matt. 9:24; Acts 7:60; (1 Cor. 15:18, 51)">⚓</a><font color="red">sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then His disciples said, “Lord, if he sleeps he will get well.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_13"><sup>13</sup>However, Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then Jesus said to them plainly, <font color="red">“Lazarus is dead.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that you may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15; John 14:5; 20:26–28; Acts 1:13">⚓</a>Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with Him.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>I Am the Resurrection and the Life</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_11_17"> <sup>17</sup>So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_18"><sup>18</sup>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_19"><sup>19</sup>And many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_20"> <sup>20</sup>Now Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him, but Mary was sitting in the house. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_21"><sup>21</sup>Now Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_22"><sup>22</sup>But even now I know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 9:31; 11:41)">⚓</a>whatever You ask of God, God will give You.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_23"> <sup>23</sup>Jesus said to her, <font color="red">“Your brother will rise again.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_24"> <sup>24</sup>Martha said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 14:14; John 5:29)">⚓</a>“I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_25"> <sup>25</sup>Jesus said to her, <font color="red">“I am </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 5:21; 6:39, 40, 44; (Rev. 1:18)">⚓</a><font color="red">the resurrection and the life. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:16, 36; 1 John 5:10">⚓</a><font color="red">He who believes in Me, though he may </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:22; (Heb. 9:27)">⚓</a><font color="red">die, he shall live.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_26"><sup>26</sup><font color="red">And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_27"> <sup>27</sup>She said to Him, “Yes, Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:16; Luke 2:11; John 4:42; 6:14, 69">⚓</a>I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus and Death, the Last Enemy</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_11_28"> <sup>28</sup>And when she had said these things, she went her way and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, “The Teacher has come and is calling for you.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_29"><sup>29</sup>As soon as she heard <i>that,</i> she arose quickly and came to Him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_30"><sup>30</sup>Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met Him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_31"><sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:19, 33">⚓</a>Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb to weep there.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_32"> <sup>32</sup>Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:22; 7:25; Rev. 1:17">⚓</a>fell down at His feet, saying to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:21">⚓</a>“Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_33"> <sup>33</sup>Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_34"><sup>34</sup>And He said, <font color="red">“Where have you laid him?”</font><br/> They said to Him, “Lord, come and see.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_35"> <sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 19:41">⚓</a>Jesus wept. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_36"><sup>36</sup>Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_37"> <sup>37</sup>And some of them said, “Could not this Man, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 9:6, 7">⚓</a>who opened the eyes of the blind, also have kept this man from dying?”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Lazarus Raised from the Dead</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_11_38"> <sup>38</sup>Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:60, 66; Mark 15:46; Luke 24:2; John 20:1">⚓</a>stone lay against it. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_39"><sup>39</sup>Jesus said, <font color="red">“Take away the stone.”</font><br/> Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, “Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been <i>dead</i> four days.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_40"> <sup>40</sup>Jesus said to her, <font color="red">“Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 11:4, 23)">⚓</a><font color="red">see the glory of God?”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_41"><sup>41</sup>Then they took away the stone <i>from</i> <i>the</i> <i>place</i> where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted up <i>His</i> eyes and said, <font color="red">“Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_42"><sup>42</sup><font color="red">And I know that You always hear Me, but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:30; 17:21">⚓</a><font color="red">because of the people who are standing by I said <i>this,</i> that they may believe that You sent Me.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_43"><sup>43</sup>Now when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice, <font color="red">“Lazarus, come forth!”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_44"><sup>44</sup>And he who had died came out bound hand and foot with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 19:40">⚓</a>graveclothes, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 20:7">⚓</a>his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Loose him, and let him go.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Plot to Kill Jesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_11_45"> <sup>45</sup>Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 2:23; 10:42; 12:11, 18">⚓</a>and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in Him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_46"><sup>46</sup>But some of them went away to the Pharisees and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 5:15">⚓</a>told them the things Jesus did. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_47"><sup>47</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:2; Matt. 26:3; Mark 14:1; Luke 22:2">⚓</a>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:19; Acts 4:16">⚓</a>“What shall we do? For this Man works many signs. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_48"><sup>48</sup>If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_49"> <sup>49</sup>And one of them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:3; Luke 3:2; John 18:14; Acts 4:6">⚓</a>Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all, </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_50"><sup>50</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 18:14">⚓</a>nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_51"><sup>51</sup>Now this he did not say on his own <i>authority;</i> but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_52"><sup>52</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 49:6; Acts 10:45; 11:18; 13:46; (1 John 2:2)">⚓</a>not for that nation only, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:27; John 10:16; (Eph. 2:14–17)">⚓</a>also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_53"> <sup>53</sup>Then, from that day on, they plotted to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:4; Luke 6:11; 19:47; 22:2; John 5:16">⚓</a>put Him to death. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_54"><sup>54</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:1, 3; 7:1">⚓</a>Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 13:19">⚓</a>Ephraim, and there remained with His disciples.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_11_55"> <sup>55</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:1; Mark 14:1; Luke 22:1; John 2:13; 5:1; 6:4">⚓</a>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 9:10, 13; 31:19, 20; 2 Chr. 30:17; Luke 2:22">⚓</a>purify themselves. </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_56"><sup>56</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:11">⚓</a>Then they sought Jesus, and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, “What do you think—that He will not come to the feast?” </span>
<span class="verse gi_11_57"><sup>57</sup>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if anyone knew where He was, he should report <i>it,</i> that they might <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:14–16">⚓</a>seize Him.<br/></span>
