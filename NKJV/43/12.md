<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>The Anointing at Bethany</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:17; John 11:1, 43">⚓</a>where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom He had raised from the dead. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:6; Mark 14:3; Luke 10:38–41">⚓</a>There they made Him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_3"><sup>3</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:38, 39; John 11:2">⚓</a>Mary took a pound of very costly oil of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Song 1:12">⚓</a>spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_4"> <sup>4</sup>But one of His disciples, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 13:26">⚓</a>Judas Iscariot, Simon’s <i>son,</i> who would betray Him, said, </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_5"><sup>5</sup>“Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?” </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_6"><sup>6</sup>This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 13:29">⚓</a>had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_7"> <sup>7</sup>But Jesus said, <font color="red">“Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of My burial.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_8"><sup>8</sup><font color="red">For </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 15:11; Matt. 26:11; Mark 14:7; John 17:11">⚓</a><font color="red">the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Plot to Kill Lazarus</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_12_9"> <sup>9</sup>Now a great many of the Jews knew that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:43, 44">⚓</a>whom He had raised from the dead. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 16:31">⚓</a>But the chief priests plotted to put Lazarus to death also, </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:45; 12:18">⚓</a>because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Triumphal Entry</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_12_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:4–9; Mark 11:7–10; Luke 19:35–38">⚓</a>The next day a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_13"><sup>13</sup>took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him, and cried out:<br/>  “Hosanna!<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 118:25, 26">⚓</a>‘Blessed <i>is</i> He who comes in the name of the LORD!’<br/>   The King of Israel!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:7">⚓</a>Then Jesus, when He had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written:<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_15">  <sup>15</sup>“Fear<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 40:9; Zech. 9:9">⚓</a> not, daughter of Zion;<br/>   Behold, your King is coming,<br/>   Sitting on a donkey’s colt.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 18:34">⚓</a>His disciples did not understand these things at first; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:39; 12:23">⚓</a>but when Jesus was glorified, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 14:26)">⚓</a>then they remembered that these things were written about Him and <i>that</i> they had done these things to Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_17"> <sup>17</sup>Therefore the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead, bore witness. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:11">⚓</a>For this reason the people also met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_19"><sup>19</sup>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:47, 48">⚓</a>“You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look, the world has gone after Him!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Fruitful Grain of Wheat</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_12_20"> <sup>20</sup>Now there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 7:26; Acts 17:4">⚓</a>were certain Greeks among those <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:41, 42; Acts 8:27">⚓</a>who came up to worship at the feast. </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_21"><sup>21</sup>Then they came to Philip, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:43, 44; 14:8–11">⚓</a>who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_22"> <sup>22</sup>Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_23"> <sup>23</sup>But Jesus answered them, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:18, 45; John 13:32; Acts 3:13">⚓</a><font color="red">“The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_24"><sup>24</sup><font color="red">Most assuredly, I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 14:9); 1 Cor. 15:36">⚓</a><font color="red">unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.</font></span>

<span class="verse gi_12_27"> <sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 26:38, 39); Mark 14:34; Luke 12:50; John 11:33">⚓</a><font color="red">“Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 22:53; John 18:37">⚓</a><font color="red">But for this purpose I came to this hour.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_28"><sup>28</sup><font color="red">Father, glorify Your name.”</font><br/> <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:17; 17:5; Mark 1:11; 9:7; Luke 3:22; 9:35">⚓</a>Then a voice came from heaven, <i>saying,</i> “I have both glorified <i>it</i> and will glorify <i>it</i> again.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_29"> <sup>29</sup>Therefore the people who stood by and heard <i>it</i> said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to Him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_30"> <sup>30</sup>Jesus answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:42">⚓</a><font color="red">“This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sake.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_31"><sup>31</sup><font color="red">Now is the judgment of this world; now </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:29; Luke 10:18; (Acts 26:18; 2 Cor. 4:4)">⚓</a><font color="red">the ruler of this world will be cast out.</font></span>

<span class="verse gi_12_33"><sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 18:32; 21:19">⚓</a>This He said, signifying by what death He would die.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_34"> <sup>34</sup>The people answered Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 89:36, 37; Is. 9:6, 7; Mic. 4:7">⚓</a>“We have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever; and how <i>can</i> You say, <font color="red">‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’</font>?

<span class="verse gi_12_35"> <sup>35</sup>Then Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“A little while longer </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:9; 7:33; 8:12)">⚓</a><font color="red">the light is with you. </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 13:16; (Gal. 6:10); Eph. 5:8">⚓</a><font color="red">Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you; </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:10; (1 John 2:9–11)">⚓</a><font color="red">he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.</font></span>

<div class="title"><h3>Who Has Believed Our Report?</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_12_37"> <sup>37</sup>But although He had done so many <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:47">⚓</a>signs before them, they did not believe in Him, </span>
<span class="verse gi_12_38"><sup>38</sup>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:1; Rom. 10:16">⚓</a>“Lord, who has believed our report?<br/>   And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_12_39"> <sup>39</sup>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:<br/></span>

<span class="verse gi_12_42"> <sup>42</sup>Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in Him, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:13; 9:22">⚓</a>because of the Pharisees they did not confess <i>Him,</i> lest they should be put out of the synagogue; </span>
