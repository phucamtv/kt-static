<span class="verse gi_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:2">⚓</a>before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:23; 17:1">⚓</a>His hour had come that He should depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 15:9">⚓</a>loved them to the end.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_2"> <sup>2</sup>And supper being ended, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 22:3">⚓</a>the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s <i>son,</i> to betray Him, </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_3"><sup>3</sup>Jesus, knowing <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:27; (John 5:20–23; 17:2); Acts 2:36; 1 Cor. 15:27; (Heb. 2:8)">⚓</a>that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:42; 16:28">⚓</a>had come from God and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 17:11; 20:17">⚓</a>was going to God, </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 22:27; Phil. 2:7, 8)">⚓</a>rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself. </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_5"><sup>5</sup>After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe <i>them</i> with the towel with which He was girded. </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_6"><sup>6</sup>Then He came to Simon Peter. And <i>Peter</i> said to Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:14">⚓</a>“Lord, are You washing my feet?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_7"> <sup>7</sup>Jesus answered and said to him, <font color="red">“What I am doing you </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:16; 16:12">⚓</a><font color="red">do not understand now, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 13:19">⚓</a><font color="red">but you will know after this.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_8"> <sup>8</sup>Peter said to Him, “You shall never wash my feet!”<br/> Jesus answered him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 51:2, 7; Ezek. 36:25; Acts 22:16; 1 Cor. 6:11; Eph. 5:26; Titus 3:5; Heb. 10:22)">⚓</a><font color="red">“If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_9"> <sup>9</sup>Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also <i>my</i> hands and <i>my</i> head!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_10"> <sup>10</sup>Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“He who is bathed needs only to wash <i>his</i> feet, but is completely clean; and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 15:3; Eph. 5:26)">⚓</a><font color="red">you are clean, but not all of you.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_11"><sup>11</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 6:64; 18:4">⚓</a>He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, <font color="red">“You are not all clean.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_12"> <sup>12</sup>So when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and sat down again, He said to them, <font color="red">“Do you know what I have done to you?</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 23:8, 10; Luke 6:46; (1 Cor. 8:6; 12:3); Eph. 6:9; (Phil. 2:11)">⚓</a><font color="red">You call Me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for <i>so</i> I am.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 22:27">⚓</a><font color="red">If I then, <i>your</i> Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 12:10; Gal. 6:1, 2; 1 Pet. 5:5)">⚓</a><font color="red">you also ought to wash one another’s feet.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_15"><sup>15</sup><font color="red">For </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:29; Phil. 2:5; (1 Pet. 2:21–24); 1 John 2:6">⚓</a><font color="red">I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:24; (Luke 6:40); John 15:20">⚓</a><font color="red">Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 7:24; Luke 11:28; (James 1:25)">⚓</a><font color="red">If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Identifies His Betrayer</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_13_18"> <sup>18</sup><font color="red">“I do not speak concerning all of you.

<span class="verse gi_13_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 14:29; 16:4">⚓</a><font color="red">Now I tell you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe that I am <i>He.</i></font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:40; Mark 9:37; Luke 9:48; 10:16; Gal. 4:14">⚓</a><font color="red">Most assuredly, I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:21; Mark 14:18; Luke 22:21">⚓</a>When Jesus had said these things, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:27">⚓</a>He was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, <font color="red">“Most assuredly, I say to you, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 41:9; Matt. 26:46; Mark 14:42; Luke 22:48; John 6:64; 18:5; Acts 1:17; 1 John 2:19">⚓</a><font color="red">one of you will betray Me.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_22"><sup>22</sup>Then the disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom He spoke.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_23"> <sup>23</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 19:26; 20:2; 21:7, 20">⚓</a>there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved. </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_24"><sup>24</sup>Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask who it was of whom He spoke.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then, leaning back on Jesus’ breast, he said to Him, “Lord, who is it?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_26"> <sup>26</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped <i>it.</i>”</font> And having dipped the bread, He gave <i>it</i> to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:4; John 6:70, 71; 12:4; Acts 1:16">⚓</a>Judas Iscariot, <i>the</i> <i>son</i> of Simon. </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 22:3">⚓</a>Now after the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“What you do, do quickly.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_28"><sup>28</sup>But no one at the table knew for what reason He said this to him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_13_29"><sup>29</sup>For some thought, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:6">⚓</a>Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, “Buy <i>those</i> <i>things</i> we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_30"> <sup>30</sup>Having received the piece of bread, he then went out immediately. And it was night.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The New Commandment</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_13_31"> <sup>31</sup>So, when he had gone out, Jesus said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:23; Acts 3:13">⚓</a><font color="red">“Now the Son of Man is glorified, and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 14:13; 17:4; 1 Pet. 4:11)">⚓</a><font color="red">God is glorified in Him.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_32"><sup>32</sup><font color="red">If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:23">⚓</a><font color="red">glorify Him immediately.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_33"><sup>33</sup><font color="red">Little children, I shall be with you a </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:35; 14:19; 16:16–19">⚓</a><font color="red">little while longer. You will seek Me; </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:19; (John 7:34; 8:21); Acts 1:9">⚓</a><font color="red">and as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come,’ so now I say to you.</font></span>

<span class="verse gi_13_35"><sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 John 2:5">⚓</a><font color="red">By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_13_36"> <sup>36</sup>Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, where are You going?”<br/> Jesus answered him, <font color="red">“Where I </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 13:33; 14:2; 16:5">⚓</a><font color="red">am going you cannot follow Me now, but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 21:17; 2 Pet. 1:14">⚓</a><font color="red">you shall follow Me afterward.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_37"> <sup>37</sup>Peter said to Him, “Lord, why can I not follow You now? I will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:33–35; Mark 14:29–31; Luke 22:33, 34">⚓</a>lay down my life for Your sake.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_13_38"> <sup>38</sup>Jesus answered him, <font color="red">“Will you lay down your life for My sake? Most assuredly, I say to you, the rooster shall not </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:74; Mark 14:30; Luke 22:61; John 18:25–27">⚓</a><font color="red">crow till you have denied Me three times.</font><br/></span>
