<span class="verse gi_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>When Jesus had spoken these words, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:30, 36; Mark 14:26, 32; Luke 22:39">⚓</a>He went out with His disciples over <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 15:23; 1 Kin. 2:37; 15:13; 2 Kin. 23:4, 6, 12; 2 Chr. 15:16; 29:16; 30:14; Jer. 31:40">⚓</a>the Brook Kidron, where there was a garden, which He and His disciples entered. </span>
<span class="verse gi_18_2"><sup>2</sup>And Judas, who betrayed Him, also knew the place; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 21:37; 22:39">⚓</a>for Jesus often met there with His disciples. </span>
<span class="verse gi_18_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:47–56; Mark 14:43–50; Luke 22:47–53; Acts 1:16">⚓</a>Then Judas, having received a detachment <i>of</i> <i>troops,</i> and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. </span>
<span class="verse gi_18_4"><sup>4</sup>Jesus therefore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 6:64; 13:1, 3; 19:28">⚓</a>knowing all things that would come upon Him, went forward and said to them, <font color="red">“Whom are you seeking?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_5"> <sup>5</sup>They answered Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:11; Mark 1:24; 14:67; 16:6; Luke 18:37; 24:19">⚓</a>“Jesus of Nazareth.”<br/> Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“I am <i>He.</i>”</font> And Judas, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 41:9; Matt. 20:18; 26:21; John 13:21">⚓</a>betrayed Him, also stood with them. </span>
<span class="verse gi_18_6"><sup>6</sup>Now when He said to them, <font color="red">“I am <i>He,</i>”</font> they drew back and fell to the ground.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then He asked them again, <font color="red">“Whom are you seeking?”</font><br/> And they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_8"> <sup>8</sup>Jesus answered, <font color="red">“I have told you that I am <i>He.</i> Therefore, if you seek Me, let these go their way,”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_9"><sup>9</sup>that the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 6:39; 17:12)">⚓</a><font color="red">“Of those whom You gave Me I have lost none.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_10"> <sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:51; Mark 14:47; Luke 22:49, 50">⚓</a>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_11"> <sup>11</sup>So Jesus said to Peter, <font color="red">“Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:22; 26:39; Mark 14:36; Luke 22:42">⚓</a><font color="red">the cup which My Father has given Me?”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Before the High Priest</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_18_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then the detachment <i>of</i> <i>troops</i> and the captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_18_13"><sup>13</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:57">⚓</a>they led Him away to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 3:2; John 18:24; Acts 4:6">⚓</a>Annas first, for he was the father-in-law of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:3; John 11:49, 51">⚓</a>Caiaphas who was high priest that year. </span>
<span class="verse gi_18_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:50">⚓</a>Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter Denies Jesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_18_15"> <sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:58; Mark 14:54; Luke 22:54">⚓</a>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so <i>did</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 20:2–5">⚓</a>another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest. </span>
<span class="verse gi_18_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:69; Mark 14:66–68; Luke 22:55–57">⚓</a>But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought Peter in. </span>
<span class="verse gi_18_17"><sup>17</sup>Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, “You are not also <i>one</i> of this Man’s disciples, are you?”<br/> He said, “I am <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:34">⚓</a>not.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_18"> <sup>18</sup>Now the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there, for it was cold, and they warmed themselves. And Peter stood with them and warmed himself.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Questioned by the High Priest</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_18_19"> <sup>19</sup>The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_20"> <sup>20</sup>Jesus answered him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:55; Luke 4:15; John 8:26">⚓</a><font color="red">“I spoke openly to the world. I always taught </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 6:59">⚓</a><font color="red">in synagogues and </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 14:49; John 7:14, 28">⚓</a><font color="red">in the temple, where the Jews always meet, and in secret I have said nothing.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_21"><sup>21</sup><font color="red">Why do you ask Me? Ask </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 12:37">⚓</a><font color="red">those who have heard Me what I said to them. Indeed they know what I said.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_22"> <sup>22</sup>And when He had said these things, one of the officers who stood by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 16:10; Is. 50:6; Jer. 20:2; Lam. 3:30; Acts 23:2">⚓</a>struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, “Do You answer the high priest like that?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_23"> <sup>23</sup>Jesus answered him, <font color="red">“If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do you strike Me?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_24"> <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:57; Luke 3:2; Acts 4:6">⚓</a>Then Annas sent Him bound to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:49">⚓</a>Caiaphas the high priest.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter Denies Twice More</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_18_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:71–75; Mark 14:69–72; Luke 22:58–62">⚓</a>Therefore they said to him, “You are not also <i>one</i> of His disciples, are you?”<br/> He denied <i>it</i> and said, “I am not!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_26"> <sup>26</sup>One of the servants of the high priest, a relative <i>of</i> <i>him</i> whose ear Peter cut off, said, “Did I not see you in the garden with Him?” </span>
<span class="verse gi_18_27"><sup>27</sup>Peter then denied again; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:74; Mark 14:72; Luke 22:60; John 13:38">⚓</a>immediately a rooster crowed.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>In Pilate’s Court</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_18_28"> <sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:2; Mark 15:1; Luke 23:1; Acts 3:13">⚓</a>Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:55; Acts 10:28; 11:3">⚓</a>But they themselves did not go into the Praetorium, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover. </span>
<span class="verse gi_18_29"><sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:11–14; Mark 15:2–5; Luke 23:2, 3">⚓</a>Pilate then went out to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this Man?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_30"> <sup>30</sup>They answered and said to him, “If He were not an evildoer, we would not have delivered Him up to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then Pilate said to them, “You take Him and judge Him according to your law.”<br/> Therefore the Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,” </span>
<span class="verse gi_18_32"><sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:17–19; 26:2; Mark 10:33; Luke 18:32">⚓</a>that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled which He spoke, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:14; 8:28; 12:32, 33">⚓</a>signifying by what death He would die.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_33"> <sup>33</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:11">⚓</a>Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again, called Jesus, and said to Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_34"> <sup>34</sup>Jesus answered him, <font color="red">“Are you speaking for yourself about this, or did others tell you this concerning Me?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_35"> <sup>35</sup>Pilate answered, “Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_36"> <sup>36</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 6:13">⚓</a>Jesus answered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 2:44; 7:14); Luke 12:14; John 6:15; 8:15">⚓</a><font color="red">“My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now My kingdom is not from here.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_18_37"> <sup>37</sup>Pilate therefore said to Him, “Are You a king then?”<br/> Jesus answered, <font color="red">“You say <i>rightly</i> that I am a king. For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 5:17; 20:28; Luke 4:43; 12:49; 19:10; John 3:17; 9:39; 10:10; 12:47)">⚓</a><font color="red">that I should bear </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 55:4; Rev. 1:5">⚓</a><font color="red">witness to the truth.

<span class="verse gi_18_38"> <sup>38</sup>Pilate said to Him, “What is truth?” And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:9; Matt. 27:24; Luke 23:4; John 19:4, 6; 1 Pet. 2:22–24">⚓</a>“I find no fault in Him at all.<br/></span>
