<div class="title"><h1>19</h1><h3>The Soldiers Mock Jesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>So then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 20:19; 27:26; Mark 15:15; Luke 18:33">⚓</a>Pilate took Jesus and scourged <i>Him.</i></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_2"><sup>2</sup>And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put <i>it</i> on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_3"><sup>3</sup>Then they said, “Hail, King of the Jews!” And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 50:6">⚓</a>struck Him with their hands.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_4"> <sup>4</sup>Pilate then went out again, and said to them, “Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:9; John 18:33, 38; 1 Pet. 2:22–24">⚓</a>that you may know that I find no fault in Him.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Pilate’s Decision</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_19_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And <i>Pilate</i> said to them, “Behold the Man!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_6"> <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:13">⚓</a>Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, “Crucify <i>Him,</i> crucify <i>Him!</i>”<br/> Pilate said to them, “You take Him and crucify <i>Him,</i> for I find no fault in Him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_7"> <sup>7</sup>The Jews answered him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 24:16">⚓</a>“We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:63–66; John 5:18; 10:33">⚓</a>He made Himself the Son of God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_8"> <sup>8</sup>Therefore, when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid, </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_9"><sup>9</sup>and went again into the Praetorium, and said to Jesus, “Where are You from?” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:7; Matt. 27:12, 14; Luke 23:9">⚓</a>But Jesus gave him no answer.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Pilate said to Him, “Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have power to crucify You, and power to release You?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_11"> <sup>11</sup>Jesus answered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 22:53); John 7:30">⚓</a><font color="red">“You could have no power at all against Me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:27; Rom. 13:1">⚓</a><font color="red">the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_12"> <sup>12</sup>From then on Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you let this Man go, you are not Caesar’s friend. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:2; John 18:33; Acts 17:7">⚓</a>Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:17; 1 Sam. 15:24; Prov. 29:25; Is. 51:12; Acts 4:19">⚓</a>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called <i>The</i> Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_14"><sup>14</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:62; John 19:31, 42">⚓</a>it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, “Behold your King!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_15"> <sup>15</sup>But they cried out, “Away with <i>Him,</i> away with <i>Him!</i> Crucify Him!”<br/> Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?”<br/> The chief priests answered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 49:10)">⚓</a>“We have no king but Caesar!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:26, 31; Mark 15:15; Luke 23:24">⚓</a>Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led <i>Him</i> away.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The King on a Cross</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_19_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:31, 33; Mark 15:21, 22; Luke 23:26, 33">⚓</a>And He, bearing His cross, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 15:36; Heb. 13:12">⚓</a>went out to a place called <i>the</i> <i>Place</i> of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha, </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_18"><sup>18</sup>where they crucified Him, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:16–18; Is. 53:12; Matt. 20:19; 26:2">⚓</a>two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:37; Mark 15:26; Luke 23:38">⚓</a>Now Pilate wrote a title and put <i>it</i> on the cross. And the writing was:<br/> <aside style="text-align:center;">JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</aside><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, <i>and</i> Latin.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_21"> <sup>21</sup>Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘He said, “I am the King of the Jews.” ’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_22"> <sup>22</sup>Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_23"> <sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:35; Mark 15:24; Luke 23:34">⚓</a>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_24"><sup>24</sup>They said therefore among themselves, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:18">⚓</a>“They divided My garments among them,<br/>   And for My clothing they cast lots.”<br/> Therefore the soldiers did these things.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Behold Your Mother</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_19_25"> <sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:55; Mark 15:40; Luke 2:35; 23:49">⚓</a>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary the <i>wife</i> of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:18">⚓</a>Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_26"><sup>26</sup>When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 13:23; 20:2; 21:7, 20, 24">⚓</a>the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 2:4">⚓</a><font color="red">“Woman, behold your son!”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_27"><sup>27</sup>Then He said to the disciple, <font color="red">“Behold your mother!”</font> And from that hour that disciple took her <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 18:28; John 1:11; 16:32; Acts 21:6">⚓</a>to his own <i>home.</i><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>It Is Finished</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_19_28"> <sup>28</sup>After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:15">⚓</a>that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, <font color="red">“I thirst!”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_19_29"><sup>29</sup>Now a vessel full of sour wine was sitting there; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:21; Matt. 27:48, 50; Mark 15:36; Luke 23:36">⚓</a>they filled a sponge with sour wine, put <i>it</i> on hyssop, and put <i>it</i> to His mouth. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_30"><sup>30</sup>So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 9:26; Zech. 11:10, 11; John 17:4">⚓</a><font color="red">“It is finished!”</font> And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus’ Side Is Pierced</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_19_31"> <sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:62; Mark 15:42; Luke 23:54">⚓</a>Therefore, because it was the Preparation <i>Day,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 21:23; Josh. 8:29; 10:26">⚓</a>that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:16; Lev. 23:6, 7">⚓</a>high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and <i>that</i> they might be taken away. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_32"><sup>32</sup>Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_33"><sup>33</sup>But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_34"><sup>34</sup>But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 John 5:6, 8)">⚓</a>blood and water came out. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_35"><sup>35</sup>And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 21:24">⚓</a>true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 20:31)">⚓</a>believe. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_36"><sup>36</sup>For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ex. 12:46; Num. 9:12); Ps. 34:20">⚓</a>“Not <i>one</i> of His bones shall be broken.” </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_37"><sup>37</sup>And again another Scripture says, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:16, 17; Zech. 12:10; 13:6; Rev. 1:7">⚓</a>“They shall look on Him whom they pierced.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Buried in Joseph’s Tomb</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_19_38"> <sup>38</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:57–61; Mark 15:42–47; Luke 23:50–56">⚓</a>After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 7:13; 9:22; 12:42)">⚓</a>for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave <i>him</i> permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_39"><sup>39</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:1, 2; 7:50">⚓</a>Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 45:8; Prov. 7:17; Song 4:14; Matt. 2:11">⚓</a>myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_40"><sup>40</sup>Then they took the body of Jesus, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:12; John 20:5, 7; Acts 5:6">⚓</a>bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_41"><sup>41</sup>Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. </span>
<span class="verse gi_19_42"><sup>42</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:9; Matt. 26:12; Mark 14:8">⚓</a>there they laid Jesus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 19:14, 31">⚓</a>because of the Jews’ Preparation <i>Day,</i> for the tomb was nearby.<br/></span>
