<span class="verse gi_20_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:9; Mark 16:9">⚓</a>Now when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing <i>there,</i> and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 24:16, 31); John 21:4">⚓</a>did not know that it was Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse gi_20_15"><sup>15</sup>Jesus said to her, <font color="red">“Woman, why are you weeping?

<span class="verse gi_20_25"><sup>25</sup>The other disciples therefore said to him, “We have seen the Lord.”<br/> So he said to them, “Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_20_26"> <sup>26</sup>And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, <font color="red">“Peace to you!”</font></span>
