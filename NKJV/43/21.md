<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>Breakfast by the Sea</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>After these things Jesus showed Himself again to the disciples at the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:32; Mark 14:28; John 6:1">⚓</a>Sea of Tiberias, and in this way He showed <i>Himself:</i></span>
<span class="verse gi_21_2"><sup>2</sup>Simon Peter, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 20:24">⚓</a>Thomas called the Twin, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:45–51">⚓</a>Nathanael of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 2:1">⚓</a>Cana in Galilee, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:21; Mark 1:19; Luke 5:10">⚓</a>the <i>sons</i> of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together. </span>
<span class="verse gi_21_3"><sup>3</sup>Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.”<br/> They said to him, “We are going with you also.” They went out and immediately got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing. </span>
<span class="verse gi_21_4"><sup>4</sup>But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:16; John 20:14">⚓</a>did not know that it was Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse gi_21_5"><sup>5</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:41">⚓</a>Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Children, have you any food?”</font><br/> They answered Him, “No.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_21_6"> <sup>6</sup>And He said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 5:4, 6, 7">⚓</a><font color="red">“Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find <i>some.</i>”</font> So they cast, and now they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_21_7"> <sup>7</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 13:23; 20:2">⚓</a>that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on <i>his</i> outer garment (for he had removed it), and plunged into the sea. </span>
<span class="verse gi_21_8"><sup>8</sup>But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits), dragging the net with fish. </span>
<span class="verse gi_21_9"><sup>9</sup>Then, as soon as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. </span>
<span class="verse gi_21_10"><sup>10</sup>Jesus said to them, <font color="red">“Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_21_11"> <sup>11</sup>Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not broken. </span>
<span class="verse gi_21_12"><sup>12</sup>Jesus said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:41">⚓</a><font color="red">“Come <i>and</i> eat breakfast.”</font> Yet none of the disciples dared ask Him, “Who are You?”—knowing that it was the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse gi_21_13"><sup>13</sup>Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_21_14"> <sup>14</sup>This <i>is</i> now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 20:19, 26">⚓</a>the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Jesus Restores Peter</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_21_15"> <sup>15</sup>So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <font color="red">“Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonah, do you love Me more than these?”</font><br/> He said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.”<br/> He said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:28; 1 Tim. 4:6; 1 Pet. 5:2">⚓</a><font color="red">“Feed My lambs.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_21_16"> <sup>16</sup>He said to him again a second time, <font color="red">“Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonah, do you love Me?”</font><br/> He said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.”<br/> <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 2:6; Acts 20:28; Heb. 13:20; 1 Pet. 2:25; 5:2, 4">⚓</a>He said to him, <font color="red">“Tend My </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 79:13; Matt. 10:16; 15:24; 25:33; 26:31">⚓</a><font color="red">sheep.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_21_17"> <sup>17</sup>He said to him the third time, <font color="red">“Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonah, do you love Me?”</font> Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, <font color="red">“Do you love Me?”</font><br/> And he said to Him, “Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 2:24, 25; 16:30">⚓</a>You know all things; You know that I love You.”<br/> Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“Feed My sheep.</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_21_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 13:36; Acts 12:3, 4">⚓</a><font color="red">Most assuredly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry <i>you</i> where you do not wish.”</font></span>
<span class="verse gi_21_19"><sup>19</sup>This He spoke, signifying <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 1:13, 14">⚓</a>by what death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 4:19; 16:24); John 21:22">⚓</a><font color="red">“Follow Me.”</font><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Beloved Disciple and His Book</h3></div>
<span class="verse gi_21_20"> <sup>20</sup>Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 13:23; 20:2">⚓</a>whom Jesus loved following, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 13:25">⚓</a>who also had leaned on His breast at the supper, and said, “Lord, who is the one who betrays You?” </span>
<span class="verse gi_21_21"><sup>21</sup>Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, “But Lord, what <i>about</i> this man?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_21_22"> <sup>22</sup>Jesus said to him, <font color="red">“If I will that he remain </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 16:27, 28; 25:31; 1 Cor. 4:5; 11:26; Rev. 2:25; 3:11; 22:7, 20)">⚓</a><font color="red">till I come, what <i>is that</i> to you? You follow Me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_21_23"> <sup>23</sup>Then this saying went out among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, <font color="red">“If I will that he remain till I come, what <i>is that</i> to you?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_21_24"> <sup>24</sup>This is the disciple who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 19:35; 3 John 12">⚓</a>testifies of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gi_21_25"> <sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 20:30">⚓</a>And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 7:10">⚓</a>I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.<br/></span>
