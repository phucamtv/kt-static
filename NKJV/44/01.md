<span class="verse cong_1_6"><sup>6</sup>Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, “Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” </span>

<span class="verse cong_1_24"><sup>24</sup>And they prayed and said, “You, O Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:7; Jer. 17:10; Acts 1:2">⚓</a>who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen </span>
<span class="verse cong_1_25"><sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:17">⚓</a>to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_1_26"><sup>26</sup>And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles.<br/></span>
