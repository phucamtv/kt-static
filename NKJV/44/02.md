<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Coming of the Holy Spirit</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>When <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:15; Deut. 16:9; Acts 20:16; 1 Cor. 16:8">⚓</a>the Day of Pentecost had fully come, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:14">⚓</a>they were all with one accord in one place. </span>
<span class="verse cong_2_2"><sup>2</sup>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:31">⚓</a>filled the whole house where they were sitting. </span>
<span class="verse cong_2_3"><sup>3</sup>Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and <i>one</i> sat upon each of them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_2_4"><sup>4</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:11; 5:6; 10:20; Luke 3:16; John 14:16; 16:7–15; Acts 1:5">⚓</a>they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:17; Acts 10:46; 19:6; (1 Cor. 12:10, 28, 30; 13:1)">⚓</a>to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Crowd’s Response</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:25; Acts 8:2">⚓</a>devout men, from every nation under heaven. </span>
<span class="verse cong_2_6"><sup>6</sup>And when this sound occurred, the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:32">⚓</a>multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language. </span>
<span class="verse cong_2_7"><sup>7</sup>Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, “Look, are not all these who speak <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:73; Acts 1:11">⚓</a>Galileans? </span>
<span class="verse cong_2_8"><sup>8</sup>And how <i>is</i> <i>it</i> <i>that</i> we hear, each in our own language in which we were born? </span>
<span class="verse cong_2_9"><sup>9</sup>Parthians and Medes and Elamites, those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Pet. 1:1">⚓</a>Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, </span>

<span class="verse cong_2_11"><sup>11</sup>Cretans and Arabs—we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_2_12"><sup>12</sup>So they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, “Whatever could this mean?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_2_13"> <sup>13</sup>Others mocking said, “They are full of new wine.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter’s Sermon</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_2_14"> <sup>14</sup>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said to them, “Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and heed my words. </span>

<span class="verse cong_2_38"> <sup>38</sup>Then Peter said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:47">⚓</a>“Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. </span>
