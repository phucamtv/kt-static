<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>A Lame Man Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Peter and John went up together <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:46">⚓</a>to the temple at the hour of prayer, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 55:17; Matt. 27:45; Acts 10:30">⚓</a>the ninth <i>hour.</i></span>
<span class="verse cong_3_2"><sup>2</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:8">⚓</a>a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 9:8; Acts 3:10">⚓</a>to ask alms from those who entered the temple; </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_3"><sup>3</sup>who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, asked for alms. </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_4"><sup>4</sup>And fixing his eyes on him, with John, Peter said, “Look at us.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_5"><sup>5</sup>So he gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_6"><sup>6</sup>Then Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:10">⚓</a>In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_7"><sup>7</sup>And he took him by the right hand and lifted <i>him</i> up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_8"><sup>8</sup>So he, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 35:6">⚓</a>leaping up, stood and walked and entered the temple with them—walking, leaping, and praising God. </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:16, 21">⚓</a>And all the people saw him walking and praising God. </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_10"><sup>10</sup>Then they knew that it was he who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 9:8; Acts 3:2">⚓</a>sat begging alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Preaching in Solomon’s Portico</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_3_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 10:23; Acts 5:12">⚓</a>which is called Solomon’s, greatly amazed. </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_12"><sup>12</sup>So when Peter saw <i>it,</i> he responded to the people: “Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this? Or why look so intently at us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 5:30">⚓</a>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 49:3; John 7:39; 12:23; 13:31">⚓</a>glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:2">⚓</a>delivered up and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:20; Mark 15:11; Luke 23:18; John 18:40; Acts 13:28">⚓</a>denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let <i>Him</i> go. </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_14"><sup>14</sup>But you denied <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 16:10; Mark 1:24; Luke 1:35">⚓</a>the Holy One <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:52; 2 Cor. 5:21">⚓</a>and the Just, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 18:40">⚓</a>asked for a murderer to be granted to you, </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_15"><sup>15</sup>and killed the Prince of life, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:24">⚓</a>whom God raised from the dead, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:32">⚓</a>of which we are witnesses. </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:22; Acts 4:10; 14:9">⚓</a>And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know.

<span class="verse cong_3_17"> <sup>17</sup>“Yet now, brethren, I know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:34; John 16:3; (Acts 13:27; 17:30); 1 Cor. 2:8; 1 Tim. 1:13">⚓</a>you did <i>it</i> in ignorance, as <i>did</i> also your rulers. </span>

<span class="verse cong_3_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 2:38; 26:20)">⚓</a>Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, </span>
<span class="verse cong_3_20"><sup>20</sup>and that He may send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you before, </span>
