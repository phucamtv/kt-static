<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Peter and John Arrested</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now as they spoke to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:23">⚓</a>Sadducees came upon them, </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_2"><sup>2</sup>being greatly disturbed that they taught the people and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_3"><sup>3</sup>And they laid hands on them, and put <i>them</i> in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_4"><sup>4</sup>However, many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Addressing the Sanhedrin</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_4_5"> <sup>5</sup>And it came to pass, on the next day, that their rulers, elders, and scribes, </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_6"><sup>6</sup>as well as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 3:2; John 11:49; 18:13">⚓</a>Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_7"><sup>7</sup>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:14; Matt. 21:23; Acts 7:27">⚓</a>“By what power or by what name have you done this?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_4_8"> <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 12:11, 12">⚓</a>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders of Israel: </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_9"><sup>9</sup>If we this day are judged for a good deed <i>done</i> to a helpless man, by what means he has been made well, </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_10"><sup>10</sup>let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:22; 3:6, 16">⚓</a>that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:24">⚓</a>whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before you whole. </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_11"><sup>11</sup>This is the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 118:22; Is. 28:16; Matt. 21:42">⚓</a>‘stone which was rejected by you builders, which has become the chief cornerstone.’ </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 42:1, 6, 7; 53:11; Dan. 9:24; (Matt. 1:21; John 14:6; Acts 10:43; 1 Tim. 2:5, 6)">⚓</a>Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Name of Jesus Forbidden</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:25; (1 Cor. 1:27)">⚓</a>and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they realized that they had been with Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_14"><sup>14</sup>And seeing the man who had been healed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:11">⚓</a>standing with them, they could say nothing against it. </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_15"><sup>15</sup>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_16"><sup>16</sup>saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:47">⚓</a>“What shall we do to these men? For, indeed, that a notable miracle has been done through them <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:7–10">⚓</a>evident to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse cong_4_17"><sup>17</sup>But so that it spreads no further among the people, let us severely threaten them, that from now on they speak to no man in this name.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_4_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:28, 40">⚓</a>So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_19"><sup>19</sup>But Peter and John answered and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:29">⚓</a>“Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:8; 2:32">⚓</a>For we cannot but speak the things which <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:15; (1 John 1:1, 3)">⚓</a>we have seen and heard.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_21"><sup>21</sup>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way of punishing them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:26; Luke 20:6, 19; 22:2; Acts 5:26">⚓</a>because of the people, since they all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:31">⚓</a>glorified God for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:7, 8">⚓</a>what had been done. </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_22"><sup>22</sup>For the man was over forty years old on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Prayer for Boldness</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_4_23"> <sup>23</sup>And being let go, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:44–46; 12:12">⚓</a>they went to their own <i>companions</i> and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_24"><sup>24</sup>So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one accord and said: “Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:11; 2 Kin. 19:15; Neh. 9:6; Ps. 146:6">⚓</a>You <i>are</i> God, who made heaven and earth and the sea, and all that is in them, </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_25"><sup>25</sup>who by the mouth of Your servant David have said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:1, 2">⚓</a>‘Why did the nations rage,<br/>   And the people plot vain things?<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_4_26">   <sup>26</sup>The kings of the earth took their stand,<br/>   And the rulers were gathered together<br/>   Against the LORD and against His Christ.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_4_27"> <sup>27</sup>“For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:3; Luke 22:2; 23:1, 8">⚓</a>truly against <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 1:35)">⚓</a>Your holy Servant Jesus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:18; John 10:36">⚓</a>whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_28"><sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:23; 3:18">⚓</a>to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose determined before to be done. </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_29"><sup>29</sup>Now, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your servants <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:13, 31; 9:27; 13:46; 14:3; 19:8; 26:26; Eph. 6:19">⚓</a>that with all boldness they may speak Your word, </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_30"><sup>30</sup>by stretching out Your hand to heal, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:43; 5:12">⚓</a>and that signs and wonders may be done <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:6, 16">⚓</a>through the name of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:27">⚓</a>Your holy Servant Jesus.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_4_31"> <sup>31</sup>And when they had prayed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 5:6; Acts 2:2, 4; 16:26">⚓</a>the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:29">⚓</a>and they spoke the word of God with boldness.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Sharing in All Things</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_4_32"> <sup>32</sup>Now the multitude of those who believed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:12; Rom. 15:5, 6; 2 Cor. 13:11; Phil. 1:27; 2:2; 1 Pet. 3:8">⚓</a>were of one heart and one soul; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:44">⚓</a>neither did anyone say that any of the things he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common. </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_33"><sup>33</sup>And with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 1:8)">⚓</a>great power the apostles gave <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:22">⚓</a>witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 6:15">⚓</a>great grace was upon them all. </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_34"><sup>34</sup>Nor was there anyone among them who lacked; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 19:21); Acts 2:45">⚓</a>for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold, </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_35"><sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:37; 5:2">⚓</a>and laid <i>them</i> at the apostles’ feet; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:45; 6:1">⚓</a>and they distributed to each as anyone had need.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_4_36"> <sup>36</sup>And Joses, who was also named Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated Son of Encouragement), a Levite of the country of Cyprus, </span>
<span class="verse cong_4_37"><sup>37</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:34, 35; 5:1, 2">⚓</a>having land, sold <i>it,</i> and brought the money and laid <i>it</i> at the apostles’ feet.<br/></span>
