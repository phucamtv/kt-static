<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Lying to the Holy Spirit</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_2"><sup>2</sup>And he kept back <i>part</i> of the proceeds, his wife also being aware <i>of</i> <i>it,</i> and brought a certain part and laid <i>it</i> at the apostles’ feet. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 30:2; Deut. 23:21; Eccl. 5:4">⚓</a>But Peter said, “Ananias, why has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:10; Luke 22:3; John 13:2, 27">⚓</a>Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back <i>part</i> of the price of the land for yourself? </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_4"><sup>4</sup>While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own control? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_5_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Ananias, hearing these words, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 11:13; Acts 5:10, 11">⚓</a>fell down and breathed his last. So great fear came upon all those who heard these things. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_6"><sup>6</sup>And the young men arose and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 19:40">⚓</a>wrapped him up, carried <i>him</i> out, and buried <i>him.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_5_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now it was about three hours later when his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_8"><sup>8</sup>And Peter answered her, “Tell me whether you sold the land for so much?”<br/> She said, “Yes, for so much.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_5_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then Peter said to her, “How is it that you have agreed together <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:7; Acts 5:3, 4">⚓</a>to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband <i>are</i> at the door, and they will carry you out.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 11:13; Acts 5:5">⚓</a>Then immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. And the young men came in and found her dead, and carrying <i>her</i> out, buried <i>her</i> by her husband. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:43; 5:5; 19:17">⚓</a>So great fear came upon all the church and upon all who heard these things.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Continuing Power in the Church</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_5_12"> <sup>12</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:43; 4:30; 6:8; 14:3; 15:12; (Rom. 15:19); 2 Cor. 12:12; Heb. 2:4">⚓</a>through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:11; 4:32">⚓</a>And they were all with one accord in Solomon’s Porch. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_13"><sup>13</sup>Yet <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 9:22">⚓</a>none of the rest dared join them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:47; 4:21">⚓</a>but the people esteemed them highly. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_14"><sup>14</sup>And believers were increasingly added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women, </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_15"><sup>15</sup>so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid <i>them</i> on beds and couches, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:21; 14:36; Acts 19:12">⚓</a>that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might fall on some of them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_16"><sup>16</sup>Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:17, 18; (John 14:12)">⚓</a>sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Imprisoned Apostles Freed</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_5_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:7; Acts 4:1, 2, 6">⚓</a>Then the high priest rose up, and all those who <i>were</i> with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with indignation, </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 21:12; Acts 4:3; 16:37">⚓</a>and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_19"><sup>19</sup>But at night <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:20, 24; 2:13, 19; 28:2; Luke 1:11; 2:9; Acts 12:7; 16:26">⚓</a>an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said, </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_20"><sup>20</sup>“Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 6:63, 68; 17:3; 1 John 5:11)">⚓</a>all the words of this life.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_5_21"> <sup>21</sup>And when they heard <i>that,</i> they entered the temple early in the morning and taught. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:5, 6">⚓</a>But the high priest and those with him came and called the council together, with all the elders of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Apostles on Trial Again</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_5_22"> <sup>22</sup>But when the officers came and did not find them in the prison, they returned and reported, </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_23"><sup>23</sup>saying, “Indeed we found the prison shut securely, and the guards standing outside before the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside!” </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_24"><sup>24</sup>Now when the high priest, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 22:4; Acts 4:1; 5:26">⚓</a>the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these things, they wondered what the outcome would be. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_25"><sup>25</sup>So one came and told them, saying, “Look, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_5_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then the captain went with the officers and brought them without violence, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 21:26">⚓</a>for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_27"><sup>27</sup>And when they had brought them, they set <i>them</i> before the council. And the high priest asked them, </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_28"><sup>28</sup>saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:17, 18">⚓</a>“Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And look, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:23, 36">⚓</a>and intend to bring this Man’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 23:35">⚓</a>blood on us!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_5_29"> <sup>29</sup>But Peter and the <i>other</i> apostles answered and said: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:19">⚓</a>“We ought to obey God rather than men. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:13, 15">⚓</a>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you murdered by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:39; 13:29; (Gal. 3:13; 1 Pet. 2:24)">⚓</a>hanging on a tree. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_31"><sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:19; (Acts 2:33, 36; Phil. 2:9–11)">⚓</a>Him God has exalted to His right hand <i>to</i> <i>be</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:15; Rev. 1:5">⚓</a>Prince and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:21">⚓</a>Savior, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:47; (Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14)">⚓</a>to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_32"><sup>32</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 15:26, 27; Acts 15:28; Rom. 8:16; Heb. 2:4">⚓</a>we are His witnesses to these things, and <i>so</i> also <i>is</i> the Holy Spirit <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:4; 10:44">⚓</a>whom God has given to those who obey Him.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Gamaliel’s Advice</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_5_33"> <sup>33</sup>When they heard <i>this,</i> they were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:37; 7:54">⚓</a>furious and plotted to kill them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_34"><sup>34</sup>Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:3">⚓</a>Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in respect by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_35"><sup>35</sup>And he said to them: “Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_36"><sup>36</sup>For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_37"><sup>37</sup>After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_38"><sup>38</sup>And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this work is of men, it will come to nothing; </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_39"><sup>39</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 21:15; 1 Cor. 1:25">⚓</a>but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it—lest you even be found <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:51; 9:5">⚓</a>to fight against God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_5_40"> <sup>40</sup>And they agreed with him, and when they had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:18">⚓</a>called for the apostles <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:17; Mark 13:9; Acts 16:22, 23; 21:32; 2 Cor. 11:25">⚓</a>and beaten <i>them,</i> they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_41"><sup>41</sup>So they departed from the presence of the council, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 5:10–12; Rom. 5:3; 2 Cor. 12:10; Heb. 10:34; (James 1:2; 1 Pet. 4:13–16)">⚓</a>rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name. </span>
<span class="verse cong_5_42"><sup>42</sup>And daily <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:46">⚓</a>in the temple, and in every house, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:20, 29">⚓</a>they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus <i>as</i> the Christ.<br/></span>
