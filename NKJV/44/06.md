<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Seven Chosen to Serve</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now in those days, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:41; 4:4">⚓</a>when <i>the</i> <i>number</i> <i>of</i> the disciples was multiplying, there arose a complaint against the Hebrews by the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:29; 11:20">⚓</a>Hellenists, because their widows were neglected <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:35; 11:29">⚓</a>in the daily distribution. </span>
<span class="verse cong_6_2"><sup>2</sup>Then the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 18:17">⚓</a>“It is not desirable that we should leave the word of God and serve tables. </span>
<span class="verse cong_6_3"><sup>3</sup>Therefore, brethren, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:13; 1 Tim. 3:7">⚓</a>seek out from among you seven men of <i>good</i> reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:8–13">⚓</a>business; </span>
<span class="verse cong_6_4"><sup>4</sup>but we <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:42">⚓</a>will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_6_5"> <sup>5</sup>And the saying pleased the whole multitude. And they chose Stephen, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:3; 11:24">⚓</a>a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:5, 26; 21:8">⚓</a>Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 2:6, 15">⚓</a>Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch, </span>
<span class="verse cong_6_6"><sup>6</sup>whom they set before the apostles; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:24">⚓</a>when they had prayed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 8:10; 27:18; Deut. 34:9; (Mark 5:23; Acts 8:17; 9:17; 13:3; 19:6; 1 Tim. 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6); Heb. 6:2">⚓</a>they laid hands on them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_6_7"> <sup>7</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 12:24; Col. 1:6">⚓</a>the word of God spread, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:42">⚓</a>of the priests were obedient to the faith.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Stephen Accused of Blasphemy</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_6_8"> <sup>8</sup>And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:43; 5:12; 8:15; 14:3">⚓</a>wonders and signs among the people. </span>
<span class="verse cong_6_9"><sup>9</sup>Then there arose some from what is called the Synagogue of the Freedmen (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia), disputing with Stephen. </span>
<span class="verse cong_6_10"><sup>10</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 4:12; Is. 54:17; Luke 21:15">⚓</a>they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke. </span>
<span class="verse cong_6_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:10, 13; Matt. 26:59, 60">⚓</a>Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_6_12"><sup>12</sup>And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; and they came upon <i>him,</i> seized him, and brought <i>him</i> to the council. </span>
<span class="verse cong_6_13"><sup>13</sup>They also set up false witnesses who said, “This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law; </span>
<span class="verse cong_6_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:38; 25:8">⚓</a>for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs which Moses delivered to us.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_6_15"><sup>15</sup>And all who sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as the face of an angel.<br/></span>
