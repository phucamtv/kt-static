<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>Saul Persecutes the Church</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now Saul was consenting to his death.<br/> At that time a great persecution arose against the church which was at Jerusalem; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 16:2; Acts 8:4; 11:19">⚓</a>they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_2"><sup>2</sup>And devout men carried Stephen <i>to</i> <i>his</i> <i>burial,</i> and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 23:2">⚓</a>made great lamentation over him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_8_3"> <sup>3</sup>As for Saul, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:58; 1 Cor. 15:9; Gal. 1:13; Phil. 3:6; 1 Tim. 1:13">⚓</a>he made havoc of the church, entering every house, and dragging off men and women, committing <i>them</i> to prison.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Christ Is Preached in Samaria</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_8_4"> <sup>4</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:23">⚓</a>those who were scattered went everywhere preaching the word. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_5"><sup>5</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:5; 8:26, 30">⚓</a>Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_6"><sup>6</sup>And the multitudes with one accord heeded the things spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_7"><sup>7</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:17">⚓</a>unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_8"><sup>8</sup>And there was great joy in that city.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Sorcerer’s Profession of Faith</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_8_9"> <sup>9</sup>But there was a certain man called Simon, who previously <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:11; 13:6">⚓</a>practiced sorcery in the city and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:36">⚓</a>astonished the people of Samaria, claiming that he was someone great, </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_10"><sup>10</sup>to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is the great power of God.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_11"><sup>11</sup>And they heeded him because he had astonished them with his sorceries for a long time. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_12"><sup>12</sup>But when they believed Philip as he preached the things <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:3; 8:4">⚓</a>concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptized. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_13"><sup>13</sup>Then Simon himself also believed; and when he was baptized he continued with Philip, and was amazed, seeing the miracles and signs which were done.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Sorcerer’s Sin</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_8_14"> <sup>14</sup>Now when the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:12, 29, 40">⚓</a>apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_15"><sup>15</sup>who, when they had come down, prayed for them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:38; 19:2">⚓</a>that they might receive the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_16"><sup>16</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:2">⚓</a>as yet He had fallen upon none of them. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:19; Acts 2:38">⚓</a>They had only been baptized in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:48; 19:5">⚓</a>the name of the Lord Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_17"><sup>17</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:6; 19:6; Heb. 6:2">⚓</a>they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_8_18"> <sup>18</sup>And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money, </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_19"><sup>19</sup>saying, “Give me this power also, that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_8_20"> <sup>20</sup>But Peter said to him, “Your money perish with you, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 5:16; Is. 55:1; Dan. 5:17; (Matt. 10:8)">⚓</a>you thought that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 2:38; 10:45; 11:17)">⚓</a>the gift of God could be purchased with money! </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_21"><sup>21</sup>You have neither part nor portion in this matter, for your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 17:9">⚓</a>heart is not right in the sight of God. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_22"><sup>22</sup>Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 4:27; 2 Tim. 2:25">⚓</a>if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_23"><sup>23</sup>For I see that you are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 12:15">⚓</a>poisoned by bitterness and bound by iniquity.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_8_24"> <sup>24</sup>Then Simon answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 20:7, 17; Ex. 8:8; Num. 21:7; 1 Kin. 13:6; Job 42:8; James 5:16">⚓</a>“Pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_8_25"> <sup>25</sup>So when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Christ Is Preached to an Ethiopian</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_8_26"> <sup>26</sup>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:5">⚓</a>Philip, saying, “Arise and go toward the south along the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” This is desert. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_27"><sup>27</sup>So he arose and went. And behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 68:31; 87:4; Is. 56:3; Zeph. 3:10">⚓</a>a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasury, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:41, 42; John 12:20">⚓</a>had come to Jerusalem to worship, </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_28"><sup>28</sup>was returning. And sitting in his chariot, he was reading Isaiah the prophet. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_29"><sup>29</sup>Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go near and overtake this chariot.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_8_30"> <sup>30</sup>So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, “Do you understand what you are reading?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_8_31"> <sup>31</sup>And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_32"><sup>32</sup>The place in the Scripture which he read was this:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:7, 8">⚓</a>“He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;<br/>   And as a lamb before its shearer <i>is</i> silent,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:62, 63; 27:12, 14; John 19:9">⚓</a>So He opened not His mouth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_8_33">   <sup>33</sup>In His humiliation His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:1–25">⚓</a>justice was taken away,<br/>   And who will declare His generation?<br/>   For His life is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:33–46">⚓</a>taken from the earth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_8_34"> <sup>34</sup>So the eunuch answered Philip and said, “I ask you, of whom does the prophet say this, of himself or of some other man?” </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_35"><sup>35</sup>Then Philip opened his mouth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:27; Acts 17:2; 18:28; 28:23">⚓</a>and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_36"><sup>36</sup>Now as they went down the road, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “See, <i>here</i> <i>is</i> water. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:47; 16:33">⚓</a>What hinders me from being baptized?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_8_37"> <sup>37</sup>Then Philip said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:19; (Mark 16:16; Rom. 10:9, 10)">⚓</a>“If you believe with all your heart, you may.”<br/> And he answered and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:16; John 6:69; 9:35, 38; 11:27">⚓</a>“I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_8_38"> <sup>38</sup>So he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_39"><sup>39</sup>Now when they came up out of the water, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:12; 2 Kin. 2:16; Ezek. 3:12, 14; 2 Cor. 12:2">⚓</a>the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, so that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on his way rejoicing. </span>
<span class="verse cong_8_40"><sup>40</sup>But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through, he preached in all the cities till he came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:8">⚓</a>Caesarea.<br/></span>
