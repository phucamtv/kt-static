<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>The Damascus Road: Saul Converted</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:57; 8:1, 3; 26:10, 11; Gal. 1:13; 1 Tim. 1:13">⚓</a>Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_2"><sup>2</sup>and asked <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:5">⚓</a>letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_9_3"> <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:6; 26:12, 13; 1 Cor. 15:8">⚓</a>As he journeyed he came near Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from heaven. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_4"><sup>4</sup>Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, <font color="red">“Saul, Saul, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 25:40)">⚓</a><font color="red">why are you persecuting Me?”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_9_5"> <sup>5</sup>And he said, “Who are You, Lord?”<br/> Then the Lord said, <font color="red">“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.It <i>is</i> hard for you to kick against the goads.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_9_6"> <sup>6</sup>So he, trembling and astonished, said, “Lord, what do You want me to do?”<br/> Then the Lord <i>said</i> to him, <font color="red">“Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_9_7"> <sup>7</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:7; John 12:29; (Acts 22:9; 26:13)">⚓</a>the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice but seeing no one. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_8"><sup>8</sup>Then Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he saw no one. But they led him by the hand and brought <i>him</i> into Damascus. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_9"><sup>9</sup>And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ananias Baptizes Saul</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_9_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:12">⚓</a>named Ananias; and to him the Lord said in a vision, <font color="red">“Ananias.”</font><br/> And he said, “Here I am, Lord.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_9_11"> <sup>11</sup>So the Lord <i>said</i> to him, <font color="red">“Arise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for <i>one</i> called Saul </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:39; 22:3">⚓</a><font color="red">of Tarsus, for behold, he is praying.</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_9_12"><sup>12</sup><font color="red">And in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting <i>his</i> hand on him, so that he might receive his sight.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_9_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:1">⚓</a>how much harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_14"><sup>14</sup>And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:59; 9:2, 21; 1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Tim. 2:22">⚓</a>who call on Your name.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_9_15"> <sup>15</sup>But the Lord said to him, <font color="red">“Go, for </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:2; 22:21; Rom. 1:1; 1 Cor. 15:10; Gal. 1:15; Eph. 3:7, 8; 1 Tim. 2:7; 2 Tim. 1:11">⚓</a><font color="red">he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:5; 11:13; Gal. 2:7, 8">⚓</a><font color="red">Gentiles, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 25:22, 23; 26:1">⚓</a><font color="red">kings, and the </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:40; Rom. 1:16; 9:1–5">⚓</a><font color="red">children of Israel.</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_9_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">For </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:23; 2 Cor. 11:23–28; 12:7–10; Gal. 6:17; Phil. 1:29, 30">⚓</a><font color="red">I will show him how many things he must suffer for My </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 4:11">⚓</a><font color="red">name’s sake.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_9_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:12, 13">⚓</a>And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:17">⚓</a>laying his hands on him he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:4; 4:31; 8:17; 13:52">⚓</a>be filled with the Holy Spirit.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_18"><sup>18</sup>Immediately there fell from his eyes <i>something</i> like scales, and he received his sight at once; and he arose and was baptized.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_9_19"> <sup>19</sup>So when he had received food, he was strengthened. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 26:20">⚓</a>Then Saul spent some days with the disciples at Damascus.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Saul Preaches Christ</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_9_20"> <sup>20</sup>Immediately he preached the Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_9_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then all who heard were amazed, and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:3; 9:13; Gal. 1:13, 23">⚓</a>“Is this not he who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and has come here for that purpose, so that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_9_22"> <sup>22</sup>But Saul increased all the more in strength, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:28">⚓</a>and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this <i>Jesus</i> is the Christ.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Saul Escapes Death</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_9_23"> <sup>23</sup>Now after many days were past, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:12; 2 Cor. 11:26">⚓</a>the Jews plotted to kill him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 11:32">⚓</a>But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night, to kill him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_25"><sup>25</sup>Then the disciples took him by night and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 2:15; 1 Sam. 19:12">⚓</a>let <i>him</i> down through the wall in a large basket.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Saul at Jerusalem</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_9_26"> <sup>26</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:17–20; 26:20; Gal. 1:17, 18">⚓</a>when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:36; 13:2">⚓</a>But Barnabas took him and brought <i>him</i> to the apostles. And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:20, 22">⚓</a>and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_28"><sup>28</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 1:18">⚓</a>he was with them at Jerusalem, coming in and going out. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_29"><sup>29</sup>And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:1; 11:20">⚓</a>Hellenists, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:23; 2 Cor. 11:26">⚓</a>but they attempted to kill him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_30"><sup>30</sup>When the brethren found out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him out to Tarsus.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Church Prospers</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_9_31"> <sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:11; 8:1; 16:5">⚓</a>Then the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 4:16, 29)">⚓</a>edified. And walking in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 34:9">⚓</a>fear of the Lord and in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 14:16">⚓</a>comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:5">⚓</a>multiplied.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Aeneas Healed</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_9_32"> <sup>32</sup>Now it came to pass, as Peter went <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:14">⚓</a>through all <i>parts</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>country,</i> that he also came down to the saints who dwelt in Lydda. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_33"><sup>33</sup>There he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden eight years and was paralyzed. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_34"><sup>34</sup>And Peter said to him, “Aeneas, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 3:6, 16; 4:10)">⚓</a>Jesus the Christ heals you. Arise and make your bed.” Then he arose immediately. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_35"><sup>35</sup>So all who dwelt at Lydda and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 5:16; 27:29; Is. 33:9; 35:2; 65:10">⚓</a>Sharon saw him and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:21; 15:19">⚓</a>turned to the Lord.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Dorcas Restored to Life</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_9_36"> <sup>36</sup>At Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. This woman was full <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 2:10; Titus 3:8">⚓</a>of good works and charitable deeds which she did. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_37"><sup>37</sup>But it happened in those days that she became sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid <i>her</i> in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:13; 9:39">⚓</a>an upper room. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_38"><sup>38</sup>And since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him, imploring <i>him</i> not to delay in coming to them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_39"><sup>39</sup>Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought <i>him</i> to the upper room. And all the widows stood by him weeping, showing the tunics and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_40"><sup>40</sup>But Peter <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:25">⚓</a>put them all out, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 22:41; Acts 7:60">⚓</a>knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:41, 42; John 11:43">⚓</a>said, “Tabitha, arise.” And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_41"><sup>41</sup>Then he gave her <i>his</i> hand and lifted her up; and when he had called the saints and widows, he presented her alive. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_42"><sup>42</sup>And it became known throughout all Joppa, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:45">⚓</a>and many believed on the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse cong_9_43"><sup>43</sup>So it was that he stayed many days in Joppa with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:6">⚓</a>Simon, a tanner.<br/></span>
