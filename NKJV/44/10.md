<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>Cornelius Sends a Delegation</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>There was a certain man in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:40; 23:23">⚓</a>Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment, </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:2; 9:22; 22:12">⚓</a>a devout <i>man</i> and one who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 10:22, 35; 13:16, 26)">⚓</a>feared God with all his household, who gave alms generously to the people, and prayed to God always. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_3"><sup>3</sup>About the ninth hour of the day <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:30; 11:13">⚓</a>he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, “Cornelius!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_10_4"> <sup>4</sup>And when he observed him, he was afraid, and said, “What is it, lord?”<br/> So he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_5"><sup>5</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:13, 14">⚓</a>send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_6"><sup>6</sup>He is lodging with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:43">⚓</a>Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:14">⚓</a>He will tell you what you must do.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_7"><sup>7</sup>And when the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who waited on him continually. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_8"><sup>8</sup>So when he had explained all <i>these</i> things to them, he sent them to Joppa.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter’s Vision</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_10_9"> <sup>9</sup>The next day, as they went on their journey and drew near the city, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts10:9–32; 11:5–14">⚓</a>Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_10"><sup>10</sup>Then he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_11"><sup>11</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:1; Matt. 3:16; Acts 7:56; Rev. 4:1; 19:11">⚓</a>saw heaven opened and an object like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_12"><sup>12</sup>In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_13"><sup>13</sup>And a voice came to him, <font color="red">“Rise, Peter; kill and eat.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_10_14"> <sup>14</sup>But Peter said, “Not so, Lord! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:4; 20:25; Deut. 14:3, 7; Ezek. 4:14">⚓</a>For I have never eaten anything common or unclean.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_10_15"> <sup>15</sup>And a voice <i>spoke</i> to him again the second time, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 15:11; Mark 7:19); Acts 10:28; (Rom. 14:14); 1 Cor. 10:25; (1 Tim. 4:4; Titus 1:15)">⚓</a><font color="red">“What God has cleansed you must not call common.”</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_10_16"><sup>16</sup>This was done three times. And the object was taken up into heaven again.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Summoned to Caesarea</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_10_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now while Peter wondered within himself what this vision which he had seen meant, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_18"><sup>18</sup>And they called and asked whether Simon, whose surname was Peter, was lodging there.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_10_19"> <sup>19</sup>While Peter thought about the vision, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:12">⚓</a>the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are seeking you. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:7–9">⚓</a>Arise therefore, go down and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_10_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then Peter went down to the men who had been sent to him from Cornelius, and said, “Yes, I am he whom you seek. For what reason have you come?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_10_22"> <sup>22</sup>And they said, “Cornelius <i>the</i> centurion, a just man, one who fears God and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:12">⚓</a>has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by a holy angel to summon you to his house, and to hear words from you.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_23"><sup>23</sup>Then he invited them in and lodged <i>them.</i><br/> On the next day Peter went away with them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:45; 11:12">⚓</a>and some brethren from Joppa accompanied him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter Meets Cornelius</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_10_24"> <sup>24</sup>And the following day they entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_25"><sup>25</sup>As Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped <i>him.</i></span>
<span class="verse cong_10_26"><sup>26</sup>But Peter lifted him up, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:14, 15; Rev. 19:10; 22:8">⚓</a>“Stand up; I myself am also a man.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_27"><sup>27</sup>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_28"><sup>28</sup>Then he said to them, “You know how <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 4:9; 18:28; Acts 11:3; Gal. 2:12">⚓</a>unlawful it is for a Jewish man to keep company with or go to one of another nation. But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 10:14, 35; 15:8, 9)">⚓</a>God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_29"><sup>29</sup>Therefore I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_10_30"> <sup>30</sup>So Cornelius said, “Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:10">⚓</a>a man stood before me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:3; Mark 16:5">⚓</a>in bright clothing, </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_31"><sup>31</sup>and said, ‘Cornelius, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:12">⚓</a>your prayer has been heard, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 6:10">⚓</a>your alms are remembered in the sight of God. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_32"><sup>32</sup>Send therefore to Joppa and call Simon here, whose surname is Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea. When he comes, he will speak to you.’ </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_33"><sup>33</sup>So I sent to you immediately, and you have done well to come. Now therefore, we are all present before God, to hear all the things commanded you by God.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Preaching to Cornelius’ Household</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_10_34"> <sup>34</sup>Then Peter opened <i>his</i> mouth and said: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 10:17; 2 Chr. 19:7; Rom. 2:11; Gal. 2:6; Eph. 6:9">⚓</a>“In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_35"><sup>35</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:9; (1 Cor. 12; 13; Eph. 2:13)">⚓</a>in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 15:1, 2">⚓</a>accepted by Him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_36"><sup>36</sup>The word which <i>God</i> sent to the children of Israel, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 57:19; Eph. 2:14; (Col. 1:20)">⚓</a>preaching peace through Jesus Christ—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:18; Acts 2:36; Rom. 10:12; 1 Cor. 15:27">⚓</a>He is Lord of all— </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_37"><sup>37</sup>that word you know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:14">⚓</a>began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached: </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_38"><sup>38</sup>how <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 61:1–3; Luke 4:18">⚓</a>God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:23">⚓</a>went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:2; 8:29">⚓</a>for God was with Him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_39"><sup>39</sup>And we are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:8">⚓</a>witnesses of all things which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:23">⚓</a>killed by hanging on a tree. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_40"><sup>40</sup>Him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 6:2; Matt. 12:39, 40; 16:4; 20:19; John 2:19–21; Acts 2:24">⚓</a>God raised up on the third day, and showed Him openly, </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_41"><sup>41</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 14:17, 19, 22; 15:27)">⚓</a>not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, <i>even</i> to us <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:30, 41–43">⚓</a>who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_42"><sup>42</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:19">⚓</a>He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 5:22, 27; Acts 17:31">⚓</a>that it is He who was ordained by God <i>to</i> <i>be</i> Judge <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 14:9; 2 Tim. 4:1; 1 Pet. 4:5">⚓</a>of the living and the dead. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_43"><sup>43</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 42:1; 53:11; 61:1); Jer. 31:34; Dan. 9:24; Hos. 6:1–3; Mic. 7:18; Zech. 13:1; Mal. 4:2">⚓</a>To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 3:16, 18; Acts 26:18); Rom. 10:11; Gal. 3:22">⚓</a>whoever believes in Him will receive <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:38, 39">⚓</a>remission of sins.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Holy Spirit Falls on the Gentiles</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_10_44"> <sup>44</sup>While Peter was still speaking these words, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:31">⚓</a>the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_45"><sup>45</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:23">⚓</a>And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 42:1, 6; 49:6; Luke 2:32; John 11:52; Acts 11:18">⚓</a>because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_46"><sup>46</sup>For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.<br/> Then Peter answered, </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_47"><sup>47</sup>“Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:4; 10:44; 11:17; 15:8">⚓</a>just as we <i>have?</i>” </span>
<span class="verse cong_10_48"><sup>48</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:14–17">⚓</a>And he commanded them to be baptized <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:38; 8:16; 19:5">⚓</a>in the name of the Lord.
