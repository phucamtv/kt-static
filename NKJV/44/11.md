<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>Peter Defends God’s Grace</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_2"><sup>2</sup>And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:45">⚓</a>those of the circumcision contended with him, </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_3"><sup>3</sup>saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:11; Acts 10:28">⚓</a>“You went in to uncircumcised men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 2:12">⚓</a>and ate with them!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_11_4"> <sup>4</sup>But Peter explained <i>it</i> to them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:3">⚓</a>in order from the beginning, saying: </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:9">⚓</a>“I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came to me. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_6"><sup>6</sup>When I observed it intently and considered, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_7"><sup>7</sup>And I heard a voice saying to me, <font color="red">‘Rise, Peter; kill and eat.’</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_11_8"><sup>8</sup>But I said, ‘Not so, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has at any time entered my mouth.’ </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_9"><sup>9</sup>But the voice answered me again from heaven, <font color="red">‘What God has cleansed you must not call common.’</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_11_10"><sup>10</sup>Now this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_11"><sup>11</sup>At that very moment, three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_12"><sup>12</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 16:13); Acts 10:19; 15:7">⚓</a>the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:23">⚓</a>these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man’s house. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:30">⚓</a>And he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, ‘Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon whose surname is Peter, </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_14"><sup>14</sup>who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.’ </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_15"><sup>15</sup>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:1–4; 15:7–9">⚓</a>as upon us at the beginning. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_16"><sup>16</sup>Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:11; Mark 1:8; John 1:26, 33; Acts 1:5; 19:4">⚓</a><font color="red">‘John indeed baptized with water, but </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 44:3">⚓</a><font color="red">you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_11_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 15:8, 9)">⚓</a>If therefore God gave them the same gift as <i>He</i> <i>gave</i> us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:47">⚓</a>who was I that I could withstand God?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_11_18"> <sup>18</sup>When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 42:1, 6; 49:6; Luke 2:32; John 11:52; Rom. 10:12, 13; 15:9, 16">⚓</a>“Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Barnabas and Saul at Antioch</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_11_19"> <sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:1, 4">⚓</a>Now those who were scattered after the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to no one but the Jews only. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_20"><sup>20</sup>But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:1; 9:29">⚓</a>the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_21"><sup>21</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:66; Acts 2:47">⚓</a>the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:35; 14:1">⚓</a>turned to the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_11_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then news of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:36; 9:27">⚓</a>Barnabas to go as far as Antioch. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_23"><sup>23</sup>When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:43; 14:22">⚓</a>encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_24"><sup>24</sup>For he was a good man, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:5">⚓</a>full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:14; 11:21">⚓</a>And a great many people were added to the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_11_25"> <sup>25</sup>Then Barnabas departed for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:11, 30">⚓</a>Tarsus to seek Saul. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_26"><sup>26</sup>And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Relief to Judea</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_11_27"> <sup>27</sup>And in these days <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:17; 13:1; 15:32; 21:9; 1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11">⚓</a>prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_28"><sup>28</sup>Then one of them, named <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 16:13; Acts 21:10">⚓</a>Agabus, stood up and showed by the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine throughout all the world, which also happened in the days of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:2">⚓</a>Claudius Caesar. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_29"><sup>29</sup>Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 15:26; 1 Cor. 16:1; 2 Cor. 9:1">⚓</a>relief to the brethren dwelling in Judea. </span>
<span class="verse cong_11_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 12:25">⚓</a>This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.<br/></span>
