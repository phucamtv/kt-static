<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>Herod’s Violence to the Church</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now about that time Herod the king stretched out <i>his</i> hand to harass some from the church. </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_2"><sup>2</sup>Then he killed James <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:21; 20:23">⚓</a>the brother of John with the sword. </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_3"><sup>3</sup>And because he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to seize Peter also. Now it was <i>during</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:15; 23:15; Acts 20:6">⚓</a>the Days of Unleavened Bread. </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_4"><sup>4</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 21:18">⚓</a>when he had arrested him, he put <i>him</i> in prison, and delivered <i>him</i> to four squads of soldiers to keep him, intending to bring him before the people after Passover.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Peter Freed from Prison</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_12_5"> <sup>5</sup>Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church. </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_6"><sup>6</sup>And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison. </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_7"><sup>7</sup>Now behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:19">⚓</a>an angel of the Lord stood by <i>him,</i> and a light shone in the prison; and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, “Arise quickly!” And his chains fell off <i>his</i> hands. </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_8"><sup>8</sup>Then the angel said to him, “Gird yourself and tie on your sandals”; and so he did. And he said to him, “Put on your garment and follow me.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_9"><sup>9</sup>So he went out and followed him, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 126:1">⚓</a>did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:3, 17; 11:5">⚓</a>he was seeing a vision. </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_10"><sup>10</sup>When they were past the first and the second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:19; 16:26">⚓</a>which opened to them of its own accord; and they went out and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_12_11"> <sup>11</sup>And when Peter had come to himself, he said, “Now I know for certain that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 34:7); Dan. 3:28; 6:22; (Heb. 1:14)">⚓</a>the Lord has sent His angel, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 5:19; (Ps. 33:18, 19; 34:22; 41:2); 2 Cor. 1:10; (2 Pet. 2:9)">⚓</a>has delivered me from the hand of Herod and <i>from</i> all the expectation of the Jewish people.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_12_12"> <sup>12</sup>So, when he had considered <i>this,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:23">⚓</a>he came to the house of Mary, the mother of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:5, 13; 15:37; 2 Tim. 4:11; Philem. 24; 1 Pet. 5:13">⚓</a>John whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 12:5">⚓</a>praying. </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_13"><sup>13</sup>And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a girl named Rhoda came to answer. </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_14"><sup>14</sup>When she recognized Peter’s voice, because of <i>her</i> gladness she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter stood before the gate. </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_15"><sup>15</sup>But they said to her, “You are beside yourself!” Yet she kept insisting that it was so. So they said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 48:16; (Matt. 18:10)">⚓</a>“It is his angel.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_12_16"> <sup>16</sup>Now Peter continued knocking; and when they opened <i>the</i> <i>door</i> and saw him, they were astonished. </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_17"><sup>17</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:16; 19:33; 21:40">⚓</a>motioning to them with his hand to keep silent, he declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, “Go, tell these things to James and to the brethren.” And he departed and went to another place.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_12_18"> <sup>18</sup>Then, as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter. </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_19"><sup>19</sup>But when Herod had searched for him and not found him, he examined the guards and commanded that <i>they</i> should be put to death.<br/> And he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed <i>there.</i><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Herod’s Violent Death</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_12_20"> <sup>20</sup>Now Herod had been very angry with the people of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:21">⚓</a>Tyre and Sidon; but they came to him with one accord, and having made Blastus the king’s personal aide their friend, they asked for peace, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 5:11; Ezra 3:7; Ezek. 27:17">⚓</a>their country was supplied with food by the king’s <i>country.</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_12_21"> <sup>21</sup>So on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on his throne and gave an oration to them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_22"><sup>22</sup>And the people kept shouting, “The voice of a god and not of a man!” </span>
<span class="verse cong_12_23"><sup>23</sup>Then immediately an angel of the Lord <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 25:38; 2 Sam. 24:16, 17; 2 Kin. 19:35; Acts 5:19">⚓</a>struck him, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 115:1">⚓</a>he did not give glory to God. And he was eaten by worms and died.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_12_24"> <sup>24</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 55:11; Acts 6:7; 19:20">⚓</a>the word of God grew and multiplied.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Barnabas and Saul Appointed</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_12_25"> <sup>25</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:30">⚓</a>Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:30">⚓</a>fulfilled <i>their</i> ministry, and they also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:5, 13">⚓</a>took with them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 12:12; 15:37">⚓</a>John whose surname was Mark.<br/></span>
