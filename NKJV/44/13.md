<span class="verse cong_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:26">⚓</a>in the church that was at Antioch there were certain prophets and teachers: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:22">⚓</a>Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 16:21">⚓</a>Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_2"><sup>2</sup>As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 8:14; Acts 9:15; 22:21; Rom. 1:1; Gal. 1:15; 2:9">⚓</a>“Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:38; Acts 14:26; Rom. 10:15; Eph. 3:7, 8; 1 Tim. 2:7; 2 Tim. 1:11; Heb. 5:4">⚓</a>to which I have called them.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_3"><sup>3</sup>Then, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:15; Mark 2:20; Luke 5:35; Acts 6:6">⚓</a>having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them, they sent <i>them</i> away.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Preaching in Cyprus</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_13_4"> <sup>4</sup>So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:36">⚓</a>Cyprus. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_5"><sup>5</sup>And when they arrived in Salamis, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 13:46)">⚓</a>they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 12:25; 15:37">⚓</a>John as <i>their</i> assistant.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_13_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now when they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:9">⚓</a>a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name <i>was</i> Bar-Jesus, </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_7"><sup>7</sup>who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man called for Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_8"><sup>8</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:11; 2 Tim. 3:8">⚓</a>Elymas the sorcerer (for so his name is translated) withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_9"><sup>9</sup>Then Saul, who also <i>is</i> <i>called</i> Paul, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:4; 4:8">⚓</a>filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_10"><sup>10</sup>and said, “O full of all deceit and all fraud, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 13:38; John 8:44; (1 John 3:8)">⚓</a><i>you</i> son of the devil, <i>you</i> enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord? </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_11"><sup>11</sup>And now, indeed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:3; 1 Sam. 5:6; Job 19:21; Ps. 32:4; Heb. 10:31">⚓</a>the hand of the Lord <i>is</i> upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a time.”<br/> And immediately a dark mist fell on him, and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_12"><sup>12</sup>Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had been done, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>At Antioch in Pisidia</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_13_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now when Paul and his party set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:38">⚓</a>John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_14"><sup>14</sup>But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:13">⚓</a>went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_15"><sup>15</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:16">⚓</a>after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, “Men <i>and</i> brethren, if you have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 13:22">⚓</a>any word of exhortation for the people, say on.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_13_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then Paul stood up, and motioning with <i>his</i> hand said, “Men of Israel, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:35">⚓</a>you who fear God, listen: </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_17"><sup>17</sup>The God of this people Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:1, 6; 13:14, 16; Deut. 7:6–8">⚓</a>chose our fathers, and exalted the people <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:17">⚓</a>when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:8">⚓</a>brought them out of it. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_18"><sup>18</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:35; Num. 14:34; Acts 7:36">⚓</a>for a time of about forty years He put up with their ways in the wilderness. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_19"><sup>19</sup>And when He had destroyed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:1">⚓</a>seven nations in the land of Canaan, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 14:1, 2; 19:51; Ps. 78:55">⚓</a>He distributed their land to them by allotment.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_13_20"> <sup>20</sup>“After that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Judg. 2:16; 1 Sam. 4:18; 7:15">⚓</a>He gave <i>them</i> judges for about four hundred and fifty years, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:20; Acts 3:24">⚓</a>until Samuel the prophet. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 8:5">⚓</a>And afterward they asked for a king; so God gave them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 10:20–24">⚓</a>Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_22"><sup>22</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 15:23, 26, 28">⚓</a>when He had removed him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 16:1, 12, 13">⚓</a>He raised up for them David as king, to whom also He gave testimony and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 89:20">⚓</a>‘I have found David the <i>son</i> of Jesse, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 13:14">⚓</a>a man after My <i>own</i> heart, who will do all My will.’ </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 11:1">⚓</a>From this man’s seed, according <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 132:11">⚓</a>to <i>the</i> promise, God raised up for Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 1:21)">⚓</a>a Savior—Jesus— </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:1; (Luke 3:3)">⚓</a>after John had first preached, before His coming, the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_25"><sup>25</sup>And as John was finishing his course, he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:11; Mark 1:7; Luke 3:16">⚓</a>‘Who do you think I am? I am not <i>He.</i> But behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:20, 27">⚓</a>there comes One after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_13_26"> <sup>26</sup>“Men <i>and</i> brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 66:16">⚓</a>those among you who fear God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:6">⚓</a>to you the word of this salvation has been sent. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_27"><sup>27</sup>For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:34">⚓</a>because they did not know Him, nor even the voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath, have fulfilled <i>them</i> in condemning <i>Him.</i></span>

<span class="verse cong_13_29"><sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 18:31">⚓</a>Now when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:57–61; Mark 15:42–47; Luke 23:50–56; John 19:38–42">⚓</a>they took <i>Him</i> down from the tree and laid <i>Him</i> in a tomb. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 16:10, 11; Hos. 6:2; Matt. 12:39, 40; 28:6">⚓</a>But God raised Him from the dead. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_31"><sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:16; Acts 1:3, 11; 1 Cor. 15:5–8">⚓</a>He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the people. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_32"><sup>32</sup>And we declare to you glad tidings—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 3:15)">⚓</a>that promise which was made to the fathers. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_33"><sup>33</sup>God has fulfilled this for us their children, in that He has raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second Psalm:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:7; Heb. 1:5">⚓</a>‘You are My Son,<br/>   Today I have begotten You.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_13_34"> <sup>34</sup>And that He raised Him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, He has spoken thus:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 55:3">⚓</a>‘I will give you the sure mercies of David.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_13_35"> <sup>35</sup>Therefore He also says in another <i>Psalm:</i><br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 16:10; Acts 2:27">⚓</a>‘You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.’<br/></span>

<div class="title"><h3>Blessing and Conflict at Antioch</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_13_42"> <sup>42</sup>So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_43"><sup>43</sup>Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:23">⚓</a>persuaded them to continue in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Titus 2:11; Heb. 12:15; 1 Pet. 5:12">⚓</a>the grace of God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_13_44"> <sup>44</sup>On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_45"><sup>45</sup>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy; and contradicting and blaspheming, they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:6; 1 Pet. 4:4; Jude 10">⚓</a>opposed the things spoken by Paul. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_46"><sup>46</sup>Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:6; Acts 3:26; Rom. 1:16">⚓</a>“It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:10; Deut. 32:21; Is. 55:5; Matt. 21:43; Rom. 10:19">⚓</a>since you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:6">⚓</a>we turn to the Gentiles. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_47"><sup>47</sup>For so the Lord has commanded us:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 42:6; 49:6; Luke 2:32">⚓</a>‘I have set you as a light to the Gentiles,<br/>   That you should be for salvation to the ends of the earth.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_13_48"> <sup>48</sup>Now when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 2:47)">⚓</a>And as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_13_49"> <sup>49</sup>And the word of the Lord was being spread throughout all the region. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_50"><sup>50</sup>But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:52; 2 Tim. 3:11">⚓</a>raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_51"><sup>51</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:14; Mark 6:11; (Luke 9:5)">⚓</a>But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and came to Iconium. </span>
<span class="verse cong_13_52"><sup>52</sup>And the disciples <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 5:12; John 16:22">⚓</a>were filled with joy and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:4; 4:8, 31; 13:9">⚓</a>with the Holy Spirit.<br/></span>
