<div class="title"><h1>14</h1><h3>At Iconium</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_14_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it happened in Iconium that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of the Jews and of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:35; Acts 18:4; Rom. 1:14, 16; 1 Cor. 1:22">⚓</a>Greeks believed. </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_2"><sup>2</sup>But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren. </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_3"><sup>3</sup>Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:20; Acts 4:29; 20:32; Heb. 2:4">⚓</a>who was bearing witness to the word of His grace, granting signs and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:12">⚓</a>wonders to be done by their hands.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_14_4"> <sup>4</sup>But the multitude of the city was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 12:51">⚓</a>divided: part sided with the Jews, and part with the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:2, 3">⚓</a>apostles. </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_5"><sup>5</sup>And when a violent attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 3:11">⚓</a>to abuse and stone them, </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_6"><sup>6</sup>they became aware of it and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:23">⚓</a>fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding region. </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_7"><sup>7</sup>And they were preaching the gospel there.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Idolatry at Lystra</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_14_8"> <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:2">⚓</a>And in Lystra a certain man without strength in his feet was sitting, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who had never walked. </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_9"><sup>9</sup><i>This</i> man heard Paul speaking. Paul, observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed, </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_10"><sup>10</sup>said with a loud voice, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 35:6)">⚓</a>“Stand up straight on your feet!” And he leaped and walked. </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_11"><sup>11</sup>Now when the people saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian <i>language,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:10; 28:6">⚓</a>“The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!” </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_12"><sup>12</sup>And Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_13"><sup>13</sup>Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:46">⚓</a>intending to sacrifice with the multitudes.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_14_14"> <sup>14</sup>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:6; Matt. 26:65; Mark 14:63">⚓</a>they tore their clothes and ran in among the multitude, crying out </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_15"><sup>15</sup>and saying, “Men, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:26">⚓</a>why are you doing these things? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="James 5:17">⚓</a>We also are men with the same nature as you, and preach to you that you should turn from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:21; Jer. 8:19; 14:22; Amos 2:4; 1 Cor. 8:4">⚓</a>these useless things <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 1:9">⚓</a>to the living God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:1; Ex. 20:11; Ps. 146:6; Acts 4:24; 17:24; Rev. 14:7">⚓</a>who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them, </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 81:12; Mic. 4:5; 1 Pet. 4:3">⚓</a>who in bygone generations allowed all nations to walk in their own ways. </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 17:24–27; Rom. 1:19, 20">⚓</a>Nevertheless He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:4; Deut. 11:14; (Matt. 5:45)">⚓</a>gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 145:16">⚓</a>food and gladness.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_18"><sup>18</sup>And with these sayings they could scarcely restrain the multitudes from sacrificing to them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Stoning, Escape to Derbe</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_14_19"> <sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:45, 50; 14:2–5; 1 Thess. 2:14">⚓</a>Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the multitudes, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:5; 2 Cor. 11:25; 2 Tim. 3:11">⚓</a>they stoned Paul <i>and</i> dragged <i>him</i> out of the city, supposing him to be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 12:1–4)">⚓</a>dead. </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_20"><sup>20</sup>However, when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Strengthening the Converts</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_14_21"> <sup>21</sup>And when they had preached the gospel to that city <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:19">⚓</a>and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_22"><sup>22</sup>strengthening the souls of the disciples, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:23">⚓</a>exhorting <i>them</i> to continue in the faith, and <i>saying,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:38; Luke 22:28; (Rom. 8:17; 2 Tim. 2:12; 3:12)">⚓</a>“We must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_23"><sup>23</sup>So when they had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:15; Mark 2:20; Luke 5:35; 2 Cor. 8:19; Titus 1:5">⚓</a>appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed. </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_24"><sup>24</sup>And after they had passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_25"><sup>25</sup>Now when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_26"><sup>26</sup>From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_14_27"> <sup>27</sup>Now when they had come and gathered the church together, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:4, 12">⚓</a>they reported all that God had done with them, and that He had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 16:9; 2 Cor. 2:12; Col. 4:3; Rev. 3:8">⚓</a>opened the door of faith to the Gentiles. </span>
<span class="verse cong_14_28"><sup>28</sup>So they stayed there a long time with the disciples.<br/></span>
