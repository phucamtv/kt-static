<div class="title"><h1>15</h1><h3>Conflict over Circumcision</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_15_1"> <sup>1</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 2:12">⚓</a>certain <i>men</i> came down from Judea and taught the brethren, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 7:22; Acts 15:5; Gal. 5:2; Phil. 3:2; (Col. 2:8, 11, 16)">⚓</a>“Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_2"><sup>2</sup>Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, they determined that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 2:1">⚓</a>Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_15_3"> <sup>3</sup>So, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:38; 21:5; Rom. 15:24; 1 Cor. 16:6, 11; 2 Cor. 1:16; Titus 3:13; 3 John 6">⚓</a>being sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:27; 15:4, 12">⚓</a>describing the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_4"><sup>4</sup>And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they reported all things that God had done with them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_5"><sup>5</sup>But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command <i>them</i> to keep the law of Moses.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Jerusalem Council</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_15_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_7"><sup>7</sup>And when there had been much dispute, Peter rose up <i>and</i> said to them: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:20">⚓</a>“Men <i>and</i> brethren, you know that a good while ago God chose among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_8"><sup>8</sup>So God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 28:9; Acts 1:24">⚓</a>who knows the heart, acknowledged them by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:4; 10:44, 47">⚓</a>giving them the Holy Spirit, just as <i>He</i> <i>did</i> to us, </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 10:12">⚓</a>and made no distinction between us and them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:15, 28">⚓</a>purifying their hearts by faith. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_10"><sup>10</sup>Now therefore, why do you test God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 23:4; Gal. 5:1">⚓</a>by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_11"><sup>11</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 3:4; 5:15; 2 Cor. 13:14; (Eph. 2:5–8; Titus 2:11)">⚓</a>we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved in the same manner as they.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_15_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring how many miracles and wonders God had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:27; 15:3, 4">⚓</a>worked through them among the Gentiles. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_13"><sup>13</sup>And after they had become silent, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 12:17">⚓</a>James answered, saying, “Men <i>and</i> brethren, listen to me: </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:7; 2 Pet. 1:1">⚓</a>Simon has declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_15"><sup>15</sup>And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_15_16">  <sup>16</sup>‘After<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 9:11, 12">⚓</a> this I will return<br/>   And will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down;<br/>   I will rebuild its ruins,<br/>   And I will set it up;<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_15_17">   <sup>17</sup>So that the rest of mankind may seek the LORD,<br/>   Even all the Gentiles who are called by My name,<br/>   Says the Lord who does all these things.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_15_18"> <sup>18</sup>“Known to God from eternity are all His works. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_19"><sup>19</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:28; 21:25">⚓</a>I judge that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 1:9">⚓</a>are turning to God, </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_20"><sup>20</sup>but that we <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:25">⚓</a>write to them to abstain <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 35:2; Ex. 20:3, 23; Ezek. 20:30; (1 Cor. 8:1; 10:20, 28); Rev. 2:14">⚓</a>from things polluted by idols, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 6:9); Gal. 5:19; Eph. 5:3; Col. 3:5; 1 Thess. 4:3; 1 Pet. 4:3">⚓</a><i>from</i> sexual immorality, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:4; Lev. 3:17; Deut. 12:16; 1 Sam. 14:33">⚓</a><i>from</i> things strangled, and <i>from</i> blood. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_21"><sup>21</sup>For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:15, 27; 2 Cor. 3:14">⚓</a>being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Jerusalem Decree</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_15_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, <i>namely,</i> Judas who was also named <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:23">⚓</a>Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_15_23"> <sup>23</sup>They wrote this <i>letter</i> by them:<br/>  The apostles, the elders, and the brethren,<br/>   To the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia:<br/>   Greetings.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_15_24">   <sup>24</sup>Since we have heard that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:1; Gal. 2:4; 5:12; Titus 1:10, 11">⚓</a>some who went out from us have troubled you with words, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 1:7; 5:10">⚓</a>unsettling your souls, saying, “<i>You</i> <i>must</i> be circumcised and keep the law” —to whom we gave no <i>such</i> commandment— </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_25">   <sup>25</sup>it seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_26">   <sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:50; 14:19; 1 Cor. 15:30; 2 Cor. 11:23–26">⚓</a>men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_27">   <sup>27</sup>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also report the same things by word of mouth. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_28">   <sup>28</sup>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_29">   <sup>29</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:20; 21:25; Rev. 2:14, 20">⚓</a>that you abstain from things offered to idols, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 17:14">⚓</a>from blood, from things strangled, and from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 5:1; 6:18; 7:2; Col. 3:5; 1 Thess. 4:3">⚓</a>sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well.<br/>   Farewell.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Continuing Ministry in Syria</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_15_30"> <sup>30</sup>So when they were sent off, they came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_31"><sup>31</sup>When they had read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_32"><sup>32</sup>Now Judas and Silas, themselves being <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:27; 1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11; Rev. 18:20">⚓</a>prophets also, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:22; 18:23">⚓</a>exhorted and strengthened the brethren with many words. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_33"><sup>33</sup>And after they had stayed <i>there</i> for a time, they were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 5:34; Acts 16:36; 1 Cor. 16:11; Heb. 11:31">⚓</a>sent back with greetings from the brethren to the apostles.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_15_34"> <sup>34</sup>However, it seemed good to Silas to remain there. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_35"><sup>35</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:1">⚓</a>Paul and Barnabas also remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Division over John Mark</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_15_36"> <sup>36</sup>Then after some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us now go back and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, <i>and</i> <i>see</i> how they are doing.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_37"><sup>37</sup>Now Barnabas was determined to take with them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 12:12, 25; Col. 4:10; 2 Tim. 4:11; Philem. 24">⚓</a>John called Mark. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_38"><sup>38</sup>But Paul insisted that they should not take with them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:13">⚓</a>the one who had departed from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_39"><sup>39</sup>Then the contention became so sharp that they parted from one another. And so Barnabas took Mark and sailed to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:36; 13:4">⚓</a>Cyprus; </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_40"><sup>40</sup>but Paul chose Silas and departed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:23; 14:26">⚓</a>being commended by the brethren to the grace of God. </span>
<span class="verse cong_15_41"><sup>41</sup>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:5">⚓</a>strengthening the churches.<br/></span>
