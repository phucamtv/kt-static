<div class="title"><h1>16</h1><h3>Timothy Joins Paul and Silas</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_16_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then he came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:6">⚓</a>Derbe and Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple was there, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:22; Rom. 16:21; 1 Cor. 4:17; 16:10; Phil. 1:1; 2:19; 1 Thess. 3:2; 2 Tim. 1:2">⚓</a>named Timothy, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 1:5; 3:15">⚓</a><i>the</i> son of a certain Jewish woman who believed, but his father <i>was</i> Greek. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_2"><sup>2</sup>He was well spoken of by the brethren who were at Lystra and Iconium. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_3"><sup>3</sup>Paul wanted to have him go on with him. And he <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 9:20; Gal. 2:3; 5:2)">⚓</a>took <i>him</i> and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in that region, for they all knew that his father was Greek. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_4"><sup>4</sup>And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:19–21">⚓</a>decrees to keep, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:28, 29">⚓</a>which were determined by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:47; 15:41">⚓</a>So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Macedonian Call</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_16_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:23; Gal. 1:1, 2">⚓</a>Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_7"><sup>7</sup>After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_8"><sup>8</sup>So passing by Mysia, they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:11; 20:5; 2 Cor. 2:12; 2 Tim. 4:13">⚓</a>came down to Troas. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_9"><sup>9</sup>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:30">⚓</a>man of Macedonia stood and pleaded with him, saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_10"><sup>10</sup>Now after he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 2:13">⚓</a>to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Lydia Baptized at Philippi</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_16_11"> <sup>11</sup>Therefore, sailing from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and the next <i>day</i> came to Neapolis, </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_12"><sup>12</sup>and from there to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:6; Phil. 1:1; 1 Thess. 2:2">⚓</a>Philippi, which is the foremost city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were staying in that city for some days. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_13"><sup>13</sup>And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily made; and we sat down and spoke to the women who met <i>there.</i></span>
<span class="verse cong_16_14"><sup>14</sup>Now a certain woman named Lydia heard <i>us.</i> She was a seller of purple from the city of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 1:11; 2:18, 24">⚓</a>Thyatira, who worshiped God. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:45">⚓</a>The Lord opened her heart to heed the things spoken by Paul. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_15"><sup>15</sup>And when she and her household were baptized, she begged <i>us,</i> saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.” So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:3; 33:11; Judg. 19:21; Luke 24:29; (Heb. 13:2)">⚓</a>she persuaded us.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Paul and Silas Imprisoned</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_16_16"> <sup>16</sup>Now it happened, as we went to prayer, that a certain slave girl <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:31; 20:6, 27; Deut. 18:11; 1 Sam. 28:3, 7; 2 Kin. 21:6; 1 Chr. 10:13; Is. 8:19">⚓</a>possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:24">⚓</a>much profit by fortune-telling. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_17"><sup>17</sup>This girl followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying, “These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_18"><sup>18</sup>And this she did for many days.<br/> But Paul, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:25, 34">⚓</a>greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:17">⚓</a>And he came out that very hour. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_19"><sup>19</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:16; 19:25, 26">⚓</a>when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:18">⚓</a>dragged <i>them</i> into the marketplace to the authorities.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_16_20"> <sup>20</sup>And they brought them to the magistrates, and said, “These men, being Jews, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:17; Acts 17:8">⚓</a>exceedingly trouble our city; </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_21"><sup>21</sup>and they teach customs which are not lawful for us, being Romans, to receive or observe.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_22"><sup>22</sup>Then the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates tore off their clothes <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 6:5; 11:23, 25; 1 Thess. 2:2">⚓</a>and commanded <i>them</i> to be beaten with rods. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_23"><sup>23</sup>And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw <i>them</i> into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_24"><sup>24</sup>Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Philippian Jailer Saved</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_16_25"> <sup>25</sup>But at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_26"><sup>26</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:31">⚓</a>Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:19; 12:7, 10">⚓</a>all the doors were opened and everyone’s chains were loosed. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_27"><sup>27</sup>And the keeper of the prison, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, supposing the prisoners had fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_28"><sup>28</sup>But Paul called with a loud voice, saying, “Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_16_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_30"><sup>30</sup>And he brought them out and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 3:10; Acts 2:37; 9:6; 22:10">⚓</a>“Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_16_31"> <sup>31</sup>So they said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 3:16, 36; 6:47; Acts 13:38, 39; Rom. 10:9–11; 1 John 5:10)">⚓</a>“Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_32"><sup>32</sup>Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_33"><sup>33</sup>And he took them the same hour of the night and washed <i>their</i> stripes. And immediately he and all his <i>family</i> were baptized. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_34"><sup>34</sup>Now when he had brought them into his house, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 5:4; Luke 5:29; 19:6">⚓</a>he set food before them; and he rejoiced, having believed in God with all his household.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Paul Refuses to Depart Secretly</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_16_35"> <sup>35</sup>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the officers, saying, “Let those men go.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_16_36"> <sup>36</sup>So the keeper of the prison reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_16_37"> <sup>37</sup>But Paul said to them, “They have beaten us openly, uncondemned <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:25–29">⚓</a>Romans, <i>and</i> have thrown <i>us</i> into prison. And now do they put us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and get us out.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_16_38"> <sup>38</sup>And the officers told these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_39"><sup>39</sup>Then they came and pleaded with them and brought <i>them</i> out, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:34">⚓</a>asked <i>them</i> to depart from the city. </span>
<span class="verse cong_16_40"><sup>40</sup>So they went out of the prison <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:14">⚓</a>and entered <i>the</i> <i>house</i> <i>of</i> Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they encouraged them and departed.<br/></span>
