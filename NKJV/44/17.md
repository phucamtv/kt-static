<div class="title"><h1>17</h1><h3>Preaching Christ at Thessalonica</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_17_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 17:11, 13; 20:4; 27:2; Phil. 4:16; 1 Thess. 1:1; 2 Thess. 1:1; 2 Tim. 4:10">⚓</a>Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_2"><sup>2</sup>Then Paul, as his custom was, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 4:16; Acts 9:20; 13:5, 14; 14:1; 16:13; 19:8">⚓</a>went in to them, and for three Sabbaths <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 2:1–16">⚓</a>reasoned with them from the Scriptures, </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_3"><sup>3</sup>explaining and demonstrating <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:26, 46; Acts 18:5, 28; Gal. 3:1">⚓</a>that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and <i>saying,</i> “This Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 28:24">⚓</a>And some of them were persuaded; and a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the leading women, joined Paul and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:22, 27, 32, 40">⚓</a>Silas.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Assault on Jason’s House</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_17_5"> <sup>5</sup>But the Jews who were not persuaded, becoming <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:45">⚓</a>envious, took some of the evil men from the marketplace, and gathering a mob, set all the city in an uproar and attacked the house of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 17:6, 7, 9; Rom. 16:21">⚓</a>Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_6"><sup>6</sup>But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 16:20)">⚓</a>“These who have turned the world upside down have come here too. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_7"><sup>7</sup>Jason has harbored them, and these are all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:2; John 19:12; 1 Pet. 2:13">⚓</a>saying there is another king—Jesus.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_8"><sup>8</sup>And they troubled the crowd and the rulers of the city when they heard these things. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_9"><sup>9</sup>So when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ministering at Berea</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_17_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:25; 17:14">⚓</a>the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_11"><sup>11</sup>These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 34:16; Luke 16:29; John 5:39">⚓</a>searched the Scriptures daily <i>to</i> <i>find</i> <i>out</i> whether these things were so. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_12"><sup>12</sup>Therefore many of them believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, prominent women as well as men. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_13"><sup>13</sup>But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the crowds. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:23">⚓</a>Then immediately the brethren sent Paul away, to go to the sea; but both Silas and Timothy remained there. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_15"><sup>15</sup>So those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:5">⚓</a>receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Philosophers at Athens</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_17_16"> <sup>16</sup>Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 2:8">⚓</a>his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was given over to idols. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_17"><sup>17</sup>Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with the <i>Gentile</i> worshipers, and in the marketplace daily with those who happened to be there. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_18"><sup>18</sup>Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, “What does this babbler want to say?”<br/> Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods,” because he preached to them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:12">⚓</a>Jesus and the resurrection.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_17_19"> <sup>19</sup>And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new doctrine <i>is</i> of which you speak? </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_20"><sup>20</sup>For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_21"><sup>21</sup>For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Addressing the Areopagus</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_17_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_23"><sup>23</sup>for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription:<br/> <aside style="text-align:center;">TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.</aside><br/> Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you: </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_24"><sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 42:5; Acts 14:15">⚓</a>“God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 10:14; Ps. 115:16; Matt. 11:25">⚓</a>Lord of heaven and earth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 8:27; Acts 7:48–50">⚓</a>does not dwell in temples made with hands. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_25"><sup>25</sup>Nor is He worshiped with men’s hands, as though He needed anything, since He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:7; Is. 42:5; Dan. 5:23">⚓</a>gives to all life, breath, and all things. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_26"><sup>26</sup>And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:8; Job 12:23; Dan. 4:35">⚓</a>the boundaries of their dwellings, </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 1:20)">⚓</a>so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:7; Ps. 139:7, 10; Jer. 23:23, 24; (Acts 14:17)">⚓</a>though He is not far from each one of us; </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_28"><sup>28</sup>for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Col. 1:17; Heb. 1:3)">⚓</a>in Him we live and move and have our being, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Titus 1:12">⚓</a>as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring.’ </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_29"><sup>29</sup>Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 115:4–7; Is. 40:18, 19; Rom. 1:23">⚓</a>we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and man’s devising. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_30"><sup>30</sup>Truly, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:16; (Rom. 3:25)">⚓</a>these times of ignorance God overlooked, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:47; Acts 26:20; (Titus 2:11, 12); 1 Pet. 1:14; 4:3">⚓</a>now commands all men everywhere to repent, </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_31"><sup>31</sup>because He has appointed a day on which <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 9:8; 96:13; 98:9; John 5:22, 27; Acts 10:42; Rom. 2:16">⚓</a>He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:24">⚓</a>raising Him from the dead.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_17_32"> <sup>32</sup>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, while others said, “We will hear you again on this <i>matter.</i>” </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_33"><sup>33</sup>So Paul departed from among them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_17_34"><sup>34</sup>However, some men joined him and believed, among them Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.<br/></span>
