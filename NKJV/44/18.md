<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>Ministering at Corinth</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>After these things Paul departed from Athens and went to Corinth. </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_2"><sup>2</sup>And he found a certain Jew named <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 16:3; 1 Cor. 16:19; 2 Tim. 4:19">⚓</a>Aquila, born in Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome); and he came to them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_3"><sup>3</sup>So, because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:34; 1 Cor. 4:12; 9:14; 2 Cor. 11:7; 12:13; 1 Thess. 2:9; 4:11; 2 Thess. 3:8">⚓</a>and worked; for by occupation they were tentmakers. </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 17:2">⚓</a>And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_18_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 17:14, 15">⚓</a>When Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:28">⚓</a>compelled by the Spirit, and testified to the Jews <i>that</i> Jesus <i>is</i> the Christ. </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_6"><sup>6</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:45">⚓</a>when they opposed him and blasphemed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 5:13; Matt. 10:14; Acts 13:51">⚓</a>he shook <i>his</i> garments and said to them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 20:9, 11, 12; 2 Sam. 1:16; 1 Kin. 2:33; Ezek. 18:13; 33:4, 6, 8; Matt. 27:25; Acts 20:26">⚓</a>“Your blood <i>be</i> upon your <i>own</i> heads; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ezek. 3:18, 19)">⚓</a>I <i>am</i> clean. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:46–48; 28:28">⚓</a>From now on I will go to the Gentiles.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_7"><sup>7</sup>And he departed from there and entered the house of a certain <i>man</i> named Justus, <i>one</i> who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue. </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:14">⚓</a>Then Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his household. And many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_18_9"> <sup>9</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:11">⚓</a>the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, <font color="red">“Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent;</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_18_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 1:18, 19">⚓</a><font color="red">for I am with you, and no one will attack you to hurt you; for I have many people in this city.”</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_18_11"><sup>11</sup>And he continued <i>there</i> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_18_12"> <sup>12</sup>When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat, </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_13"><sup>13</sup>saying, “This <i>fellow</i> persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_18_14"> <sup>14</sup>And when Paul was about to open <i>his</i> mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of wrongdoing or wicked crimes, O Jews, there would be reason why I should bear with you. </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_15"><sup>15</sup>But if it is a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:29; 25:19">⚓</a>question of words and names and your own law, look <i>to</i> <i>it</i> yourselves; for I do not want to be a judge of such <i>matters.</i>” </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_16"><sup>16</sup>And he drove them from the judgment seat. </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_17"><sup>17</sup>Then all the Greeks took <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:1">⚓</a>Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat <i>him</i> before the judgment seat. But Gallio took no notice of these things.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Paul Returns to Antioch</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_18_18"> <sup>18</sup>So Paul still remained a good while. Then he took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila <i>were</i> with him. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 6:2, 5, 9, 18; Acts 21:24">⚓</a>He had <i>his</i> hair cut off at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 16:1">⚓</a>Cenchrea, for he had taken a vow. </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_19"><sup>19</sup>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there; but he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_20"><sup>20</sup>When they asked <i>him</i> to stay a longer time with them, he did not consent, </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_21"><sup>21</sup>but took leave of them, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:21; 20:16">⚓</a>“I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem; but I will return again to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 4:19; Heb. 6:3; James 4:15">⚓</a>God willing.” And he sailed from Ephesus.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_18_22"> <sup>22</sup>And when he had landed at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:40">⚓</a>Caesarea, and gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch. </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_23"><sup>23</sup>After he had spent some time <i>there,</i> he departed and went over the region of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 1:2">⚓</a>Galatia and Phrygia in order, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:22; 15:32, 41">⚓</a>strengthening all the disciples.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ministry of Apollos</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_18_24"> <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:1; 1 Cor. 1:12; 3:4; 16:12; Titus 3:13">⚓</a>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man <i>and</i> mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus. </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_25"><sup>25</sup>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 12:11">⚓</a>fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things of the Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 3:1–11; Mark 1:7, 8; Luke 3:16, 17; 7:29; John 1:26, 33); Acts 19:3">⚓</a>though he knew only the baptism of John. </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_26"><sup>26</sup>So he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_27"><sup>27</sup>And when he desired to cross to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; and when he arrived, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 3:6">⚓</a>he greatly helped those who had believed through grace; </span>
<span class="verse cong_18_28"><sup>28</sup>for he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:22; 17:3; 18:5">⚓</a>showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.<br/></span>
