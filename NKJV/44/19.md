<div class="title"><h1>19</h1><h3>Paul at Ephesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_19_1"> <sup>1</sup>And it happened, while <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:12; 3:5, 6; Titus 3:13">⚓</a>Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:23">⚓</a>the upper regions, came to Ephesus. And finding some disciples </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_2"><sup>2</sup>he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”<br/> So they said to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 3:7; Acts 8:16">⚓</a>“We have not so much as heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_19_3"> <sup>3</sup>And he said to them, “Into what then were you baptized?”<br/> So they said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:29; Acts 18:25">⚓</a>“Into John’s baptism.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_19_4"> <sup>4</sup>Then Paul said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:11; Mark 1:4, 7, 8; Luke 3:16; (John 1:15, 26, 27); Acts 13:24">⚓</a>“John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on Him who would come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_19_5"> <sup>5</sup>When they heard <i>this,</i> they were baptized <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:19; Acts 8:12, 16; 10:48">⚓</a>in the name of the Lord Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_6"><sup>6</sup>And when Paul had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:6; 8:17">⚓</a>laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:17; Acts 2:4; 10:46">⚓</a>they spoke with tongues and prophesied. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_7"><sup>7</sup>Now the men were about twelve in all.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_19_8"> <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 17:2; 18:4">⚓</a>And he went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:3; 28:23">⚓</a>concerning the things of the kingdom of God. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_9"><sup>9</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 1:15; 2 Pet. 2:2; Jude 10">⚓</a>when some were hardened and did not believe, but spoke evil <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:2; 19:23; 22:4; 24:14">⚓</a>of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and withdrew the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_10"><sup>10</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:8; 20:31">⚓</a>this continued for two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Miracles Glorify Christ</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_19_11"> <sup>11</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:20; Acts 14:3">⚓</a>God worked unusual miracles by the hands of Paul, </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 4:29; Acts 5:15">⚓</a>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:27; Luke 11:19">⚓</a>Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 9:38; Luke 9:49">⚓</a>took it upon themselves to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “We exorcise you by the Jesus whom Paul <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:23; 2:2">⚓</a>preaches.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_14"><sup>14</sup>Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_19_15"> <sup>15</sup>And the evil spirit answered and said, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_19_16"> <sup>16</sup>Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_17"><sup>17</sup>This became known both to all Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:65; 7:16; Acts 2:43; 5:5, 11">⚓</a>fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_18"><sup>18</sup>And many who had believed came <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:6">⚓</a>confessing and telling their deeds. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_19"><sup>19</sup>Also, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned <i>them</i> in the sight of all. And they counted up the value of them, and <i>it</i> totaled fifty thousand <i>pieces</i> of silver. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:7; 12:24">⚓</a>So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Riot at Ephesus</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_19_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 15:25; Gal. 2:1">⚓</a>When these things were accomplished, Paul <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:22; 2 Cor. 1:16">⚓</a>purposed in the Spirit, when he had passed through <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:1; 1 Cor. 16:5">⚓</a>Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have been there, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:21; 23:11; Rom. 1:13; 15:22–29">⚓</a>I must also see Rome.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_22"><sup>22</sup>So he sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 1:2">⚓</a>Timothy and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 16:23; 2 Tim. 4:20">⚓</a>Erastus, but he himself stayed in Asia for a time.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_19_23"> <sup>23</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 1:8">⚓</a>about that time there arose a great commotion about <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:2">⚓</a>the Way. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_24"><sup>24</sup>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:16, 19">⚓</a>no small profit to the craftsmen. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_25"><sup>25</sup>He called them together with the workers of similar occupation, and said: “Men, you know that we have our prosperity by this trade. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_26"><sup>26</sup>Moreover you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but throughout almost all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:28; Ps. 115:4; Is. 44:10–20; Jer. 10:3; Acts 17:29; 1 Cor. 8:4; 10:19; Rev. 9:20">⚓</a>they are not gods which are made with hands. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_27"><sup>27</sup>So not only is this trade of ours in danger of falling into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Diana may be despised and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_19_28"> <sup>28</sup>Now when they heard <i>this,</i> they were full of wrath and cried out, saying, “Great <i>is</i> Diana of the Ephesians!” </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_29"><sup>29</sup>So the whole city was filled with confusion, and rushed into the theater with one accord, having seized <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:4; Rom. 16:23; 1 Cor. 1:14; 3 John 1">⚓</a>Gaius and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:4; 27:2; Col. 4:10; Philem. 24">⚓</a>Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul’s travel companions. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_30"><sup>30</sup>And when Paul wanted to go in to the people, the disciples would not allow him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_31"><sup>31</sup>Then some of the officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him pleading that he would not venture into the theater. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_32"><sup>32</sup>Some therefore cried one thing and some another, for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_33"><sup>33</sup>And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 1:20; 2 Tim. 4:14">⚓</a>Alexander <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 12:17">⚓</a>motioned with his hand, and wanted to make his defense to the people. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_34"><sup>34</sup>But when they found out that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for about two hours, “Great <i>is</i> Diana of the Ephesians!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_19_35"> <sup>35</sup>And when the city clerk had quieted the crowd, he said: “Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple guardian of the great goddess Diana, and of the <i>image</i> which fell down from Zeus? </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_36"><sup>36</sup>Therefore, since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rashly. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_37"><sup>37</sup>For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_38"><sup>38</sup>Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a case against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_39"><sup>39</sup>But if you have any other inquiry to make, it shall be determined in the lawful assembly. </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_40"><sup>40</sup>For we are in danger of being called in question for today’s uproar, there being no reason which we may give to account for this disorderly gathering.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_19_41"><sup>41</sup>And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.<br/></span>
