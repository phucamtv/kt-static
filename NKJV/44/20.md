<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>Journeys in Greece</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>After the uproar had ceased, Paul called the disciples to <i>himself,</i> embraced <i>them,</i> and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 16:5; 1 Tim. 1:3">⚓</a>departed to go to Macedonia. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_2"><sup>2</sup>Now when he had gone over that region and encouraged them with many words, he came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 17:15; 18:1">⚓</a>Greece </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_3"><sup>3</sup>and stayed three months. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:23; 23:12; 25:3; 2 Cor. 11:26">⚓</a>when the Jews plotted against him as he was about to sail to Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_4"><sup>4</sup>And Sopater of Berea accompanied him to Asia—also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:29; Col. 4:10">⚓</a>Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:29">⚓</a>Gaius of Derbe, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:1">⚓</a>Timothy, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 6:21; Col. 4:7; 2 Tim. 4:12; Titus 3:12">⚓</a>Tychicus and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:29; 2 Tim. 4:20">⚓</a>Trophimus of Asia. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_5"><sup>5</sup>These men, going ahead, waited for us at <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 2:12; 2 Tim. 4:13">⚓</a>Troas. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_6"><sup>6</sup>But we sailed away from Philippi after <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:14, 15">⚓</a>the Days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days joined them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:8; 2 Cor. 2:12; 2 Tim. 4:13">⚓</a>at Troas, where we stayed seven days.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Ministering at Troas</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_20_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 16:2; Rev. 1:10">⚓</a>the first <i>day</i> of the week, when the disciples came together <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:42, 46; 20:11; 1 Cor. 10:16">⚓</a>to break bread, Paul, ready to depart the next day, spoke to them and continued his message until midnight. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_8"><sup>8</sup>There were many lamps <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:13">⚓</a>in the upper room where they were gathered together. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_9"><sup>9</sup>And in a window sat a certain young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep. He was overcome by sleep; and as Paul continued speaking, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_10"><sup>10</sup>But Paul went down, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 17:21; 2 Kin. 4:34">⚓</a>fell on him, and embracing <i>him</i> said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:23, 24; Mark 5:39">⚓</a>“Do not trouble yourselves, for his life is in him.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_11"><sup>11</sup>Now when he had come up, had broken bread and eaten, and talked a long while, even till daybreak, he departed. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_12"><sup>12</sup>And they brought the young man in alive, and they were not a little comforted.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>From Troas to Miletus</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_20_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then we went ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, there intending to take Paul on board; for so he had given orders, intending himself to go on foot. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_14"><sup>14</sup>And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_15"><sup>15</sup>We sailed from there, and the next <i>day</i> came opposite Chios. The following <i>day</i> we arrived at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The next <i>day</i> we came to Miletus. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_16"><sup>16</sup>For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:21; 19:21; 21:4">⚓</a>he was hurrying <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 24:17">⚓</a>to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:1; 1 Cor. 16:8">⚓</a>the Day of Pentecost.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Ephesian Elders Exhorted</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_20_17"> <sup>17</sup>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_18"><sup>18</sup>And when they had come to him, he said to them: “You know, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:19; 19:1, 10; 20:4, 16">⚓</a>from the first day that I came to Asia, in what manner I always lived among you, </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_19"><sup>19</sup>serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears and trials which happened to me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:3">⚓</a>by the plotting of the Jews; </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_20"><sup>20</sup>how <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:27">⚓</a>I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house, </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:5; 19:10">⚓</a>testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 1:15">⚓</a>repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_22"><sup>22</sup>And see, now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:21">⚓</a>I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there, </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_23"><sup>23</sup>except that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:4, 11">⚓</a>the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that chains and tribulations await me. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_24"><sup>24</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:13">⚓</a>none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:25; 2 Tim. 4:7">⚓</a>so that I may finish my race with joy, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:17">⚓</a>and the ministry <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 1:1">⚓</a>which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_20_25"> <sup>25</sup>“And indeed, now I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_26"><sup>26</sup>Therefore I testify to you this day that I <i>am</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:6; 2 Cor. 7:2">⚓</a>innocent of the blood of all <i>men.</i></span>
<span class="verse cong_20_27"><sup>27</sup>For I have not shunned to declare to you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:30; John 15:15; Eph. 1:11">⚓</a>the whole counsel of God. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_28"><sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 12:32; John 21:15–17; Acts 20:29; (1 Tim. 4:16); 1 Pet. 5:2">⚓</a>Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 12:28">⚓</a>has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 1:7, 14; Col. 1:14; Titus 2:14; Heb. 9:12; (1 Pet. 1:19); Rev. 5:9">⚓</a>which He purchased <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 9:14">⚓</a>with His own blood. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_29"><sup>29</sup>For I know this, that after my departure <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 22:27; Matt. 7:15">⚓</a>savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_30"><sup>30</sup>Also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 1:20; 2 Tim. 1:15">⚓</a>from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_31"><sup>31</sup>Therefore watch, and remember that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:8, 10; 24:17">⚓</a>for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_20_32"> <sup>32</sup>“So now, brethren, I commend you to God and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 13:9">⚓</a>to the word of His grace, which is able <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:31">⚓</a>to build you up and give you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 26:18; Eph. 1:14, 18; 5:5; Col. 1:12; 3:24; (Heb. 9:15; 1 Pet. 1:4)">⚓</a>an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_33"><sup>33</sup>I have coveted no one’s silver or gold or apparel. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_34"><sup>34</sup>Yes, you yourselves know <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:3; 1 Cor. 4:12; 1 Thess. 2:9; 2 Thess. 3:8">⚓</a>that these hands have provided for my necessities, and for those who were with me. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_35"><sup>35</sup>I have shown you in every way, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 15:1; 1 Cor. 9:12; 2 Cor. 11:9, 12; Eph. 4:28; 1 Thess. 4:11; 2 Thess. 3:8">⚓</a>by laboring like this, that you must support the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, <font color="red">‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’</font> ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_20_36"> <sup>36</sup>And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_37"><sup>37</sup>Then they all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:13">⚓</a>wept freely, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:14">⚓</a>fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him, </span>
<span class="verse cong_20_38"><sup>38</sup>sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they would see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.<br/></span>
