<div class="title"><h1>21</h1><h3>Warnings on the Journey to Jerusalem</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now it came to pass, that when we had departed from them and set sail, running a straight course we came to Cos, the following <i>day</i> to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_2"><sup>2</sup>And finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_3"><sup>3</sup>When we had sighted Cyprus, we passed it on the left, sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_4"><sup>4</sup>And finding disciples, we stayed there seven days. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 20:23; 21:12)">⚓</a>They told Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_5"><sup>5</sup>When we had come to the end of those days, we departed and went on our way; and they all accompanied us, with wives and children, till <i>we</i> <i>were</i> out of the city. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 22:41; Acts 9:40; 20:36">⚓</a>we knelt down on the shore and prayed. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_6"><sup>6</sup>When we had taken our leave of one another, we boarded the ship, and they returned <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:11">⚓</a>home.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_21_7"> <sup>7</sup>And when we had finished <i>our</i> voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, greeted the brethren, and stayed with them one day. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_8"><sup>8</sup>On the next <i>day</i> we who were Paul’s companions departed and came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:40; 21:16">⚓</a>Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:5, 26, 40; Eph. 4:11; 2 Tim. 4:5">⚓</a>the evangelist, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:5">⚓</a>who was <i>one</i> of the seven, and stayed with him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_9"><sup>9</sup>Now this man had four virgin daughters <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Joel 2:28; Acts 2:17">⚓</a>who prophesied. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_10"><sup>10</sup>And as we stayed many days, a certain prophet named <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:28">⚓</a>Agabus came down from Judea. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_11"><sup>11</sup>When he had come to us, he took Paul’s belt, bound his <i>own</i> hands and feet, and said, “Thus says the Holy Spirit, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:23; 21:33; 22:25">⚓</a>‘So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and deliver <i>him</i> into the hands of the Gentiles.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_21_12"> <sup>12</sup>Now when we heard these things, both we and those from that place pleaded with him not to go up to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_13"><sup>13</sup>Then Paul answered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:24, 37">⚓</a>“What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_21_14"> <sup>14</sup>So when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 6:10; 26:42; Luke 11:2; 22:42">⚓</a>“The will of the Lord be done.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Paul Urged to Make Peace</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_21_15"> <sup>15</sup>And after those days we packed and went up to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_16"><sup>16</sup>Also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us and brought with them a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to lodge.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_21_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:4">⚓</a>And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_18"><sup>18</sup>On the following <i>day</i> Paul went in with us to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:13; Gal. 1:19; 2:9">⚓</a>James, and all the elders were present. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_19"><sup>19</sup>When he had greeted them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:4, 12; Rom. 15:18, 19">⚓</a>he told in detail those things which God had done among the Gentiles <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:17; 20:24; 1 Tim. 2:7">⚓</a>through his ministry. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_20"><sup>20</sup>And when they heard <i>it,</i> they glorified the Lord. And they said to him, “You see, brother, how many myriads of Jews there are who have believed, and they are all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:1; 22:3; (Rom. 10:2); Gal. 1:14">⚓</a>zealous for the law; </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_21"><sup>21</sup>but they have been informed about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise <i>their</i> children nor to walk according to the customs. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_22"><sup>22</sup>What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_23"><sup>23</sup>Therefore do what we tell you: We have four men who have taken a vow. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_24"><sup>24</sup>Take them and be purified with them, and pay their expenses so that they may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 6:2, 13, 18; Acts 18:18">⚓</a>shave <i>their</i> heads, and that all may know that those things of which they were informed concerning you are nothing, but <i>that</i> you yourself also walk orderly and keep the law. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_25"><sup>25</sup>But concerning the Gentiles who believe, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:19, 20, 29">⚓</a>we have written <i>and</i> decided that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from <i>things</i> offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Arrested in the Temple</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_21_26"> <sup>26</sup>Then Paul took the men, and the next day, having been purified with them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 11:55; Acts 21:24; 24:18">⚓</a>entered the temple <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 6:13; Acts 24:18">⚓</a>to announce the expiration of the days of purification, at which time an offering should be made for each one of them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_21_27"> <sup>27</sup>Now when the seven days were almost ended, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:19; 24:18">⚓</a>the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 26:21">⚓</a>laid hands on him, </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_28"><sup>28</sup>crying out, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 24:15); Acts 6:13; 24:6">⚓</a>who teaches all <i>men</i> everywhere against the people, the law, and this place; and furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_29"><sup>29</sup>(For they had previously seen <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:4">⚓</a>Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_21_30"> <sup>30</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 11:15; Acts 16:19; 26:21">⚓</a>all the city was disturbed; and the people ran together, seized Paul, and dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the doors were shut. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_31"><sup>31</sup>Now as they were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 11:23">⚓</a>seeking to kill him, news came to the commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_32"><sup>32</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:27; 24:7">⚓</a>He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_33"><sup>33</sup>Then the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 24:7">⚓</a>commander came near and took him, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:23; 21:11; Eph. 6:20; 2 Tim. 1:16; 2:9">⚓</a>commanded <i>him</i> to be bound with two chains; and he asked who he was and what he had done. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_34"><sup>34</sup>And some among the multitude cried one thing and some another.<br/> So when he could not ascertain the truth because of the tumult, he commanded him to be taken into the barracks. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_35"><sup>35</sup>When he reached the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob. </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_36"><sup>36</sup>For the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:18; John 19:15; Acts 22:22">⚓</a>“Away with him!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Addressing the Jerusalem Mob</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_21_37"> <sup>37</sup>Then as Paul was about to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, “May I speak to you?”<br/> He replied, “Can you speak Greek? </span>
<span class="verse cong_21_38"><sup>38</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:36">⚓</a>Are you not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a rebellion and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_21_39"> <sup>39</sup>But Paul said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:11; 22:3; 2 Cor. 11:22; Phil. 3:4–6">⚓</a>“I am a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city; and I implore you, permit me to speak to the people.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_21_40"> <sup>40</sup>So when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 12:17">⚓</a>motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he spoke to <i>them</i> in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 5:2; Acts 22:2">⚓</a>Hebrew language, saying,<br/></span>
