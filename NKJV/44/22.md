<span class="verse cong_22_1"> <sup>1</sup>“Brethren<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:2">⚓</a> and fathers, hear my defense before you now.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_2"><sup>2</sup>And when they heard that he spoke to them in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:40">⚓</a>Hebrew language, they kept all the more silent.<br/> Then he said: </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:39; 2 Cor. 11:22">⚓</a>“I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:3">⚓</a>at the feet of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:34">⚓</a>Gamaliel, taught <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:6; 26:5; Phil. 3:6">⚓</a>according to the strictness of our fathers’ law, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:20; Gal. 1:14">⚓</a>was zealous toward God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 10:2)">⚓</a>as you all are today. </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:3; 26:9–11; Phil. 3:6; 1 Tim. 1:13">⚓</a>I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women, </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_5"><sup>5</sup>as also the high priest bears me witness, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:14; 24:1; 25:15">⚓</a>all the council of the elders, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 22:66; Acts 4:5; 1 Tim. 4:14">⚓</a>from whom I also received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:2">⚓</a>to bring in chains even those who were there to Jerusalem to be punished.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_22_6"> <sup>6</sup>“Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:3; 26:12, 13">⚓</a>it happened, as I journeyed and came near Damascus at about noon, suddenly a great light from heaven shone around me. </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_7"><sup>7</sup>And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, <font color="red">‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?’</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_22_8"><sup>8</sup>So I answered, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And He said to me, <font color="red">‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.’</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_22_9"> <sup>9</sup>“And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:7; Acts 9:7">⚓</a>those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they did not hear the voice of Him who spoke to me. </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_10"><sup>10</sup>So I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, <font color="red">‘Arise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all things which are appointed for you to do.’</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_22_11"><sup>11</sup>And since I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_22_12"> <sup>12</sup>“Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:17">⚓</a>a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:22">⚓</a>having a good testimony with all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 3:7">⚓</a>Jews who dwelt <i>there,</i></span>
<span class="verse cong_22_13"><sup>13</sup>came to me; and he stood and said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight.’ And at that same hour I looked up at him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_14"><sup>14</sup>Then he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:13; 5:30">⚓</a>‘The God of our fathers <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:15; 26:16; Gal. 1:15">⚓</a>has chosen you that you should <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:14; 7:52">⚓</a>know His will, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:17; 26:16; 1 Cor. 9:1; 15:8">⚓</a>see the Just One, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 11:23; Gal. 1:12">⚓</a>and hear the voice of His mouth. </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:11">⚓</a>For you will be His witness to all men of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:20; 26:16">⚓</a>what you have seen and heard. </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_16"><sup>16</sup>And now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptized, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:38; 1 Cor. 6:11; (Eph. 5:26); Heb. 10:22">⚓</a>and wash away your sins, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:14; Rom. 10:13">⚓</a>calling on the name of the Lord.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_22_17"> <sup>17</sup>“Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:26; 26:20; 2 Cor. 12:2">⚓</a>it happened, when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_18"><sup>18</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:14">⚓</a>saw Him saying to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:14">⚓</a><font color="red">‘Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, for they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.’</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_22_19"><sup>19</sup>So I said, ‘Lord, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:3; 22:4">⚓</a>they know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:17; Acts 26:11">⚓</a>beat those who believe on You. </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:54—8:1">⚓</a>And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 11:48">⚓</a>consenting to his death, and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.’ </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_21"><sup>21</sup>Then He said to me, <font color="red">‘Depart, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:15; Rom. 1:5; 11:13; Gal. 2:7, 8; Eph. 3:7, 8; 1 Tim. 2:7; 2 Tim. 1:11">⚓</a><font color="red">for I will send you far from here to the Gentiles.’</font> ”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Paul’s Roman Citizenship</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_22_22"> <sup>22</sup>And they listened to him until this word, and <i>then</i> they raised their voices and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:36; 1 Thess. 2:16">⚓</a>“Away with such a <i>fellow</i> from the earth, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 25:24">⚓</a>he is not fit to live!” </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_23"><sup>23</sup>Then, as they cried out and tore off <i>their</i> clothes and threw dust into the air, </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_24"><sup>24</sup>the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and said that he should be examined under scourging, so that he might know why they shouted so against him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_22_25"><sup>25</sup>And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:37">⚓</a>“Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_22_26"> <sup>26</sup>When the centurion heard <i>that,</i> he went and told the commander, saying, “Take care what you do, for this man is a Roman.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_22_27"> <sup>27</sup>Then the commander came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman?”<br/> He said, “Yes.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_22_28"> <sup>28</sup>The commander answered, “With a large sum I obtained this citizenship.”<br/> And Paul said, “But I was born <i>a</i> <i>citizen.</i>”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_22_29"> <sup>29</sup>Then immediately those who were about to examine him withdrew from him; and the commander was also afraid after he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Sanhedrin Divided</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_22_30"> <sup>30</sup>The next day, because he wanted to know for certain why he was accused by the Jews, he released him from <i>his</i> bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down and set him before them.<br/></span>
