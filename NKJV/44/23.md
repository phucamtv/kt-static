<span class="verse cong_23_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Paul, looking earnestly at the council, said, “Men <i>and</i> brethren, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 24:16; 1 Cor. 4:4; 2 Cor. 1:12; 4:2; 2 Tim. 1:3; Heb. 13:18">⚓</a>I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_2"><sup>2</sup>And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 22:24; Jer. 20:2; John 18:22">⚓</a>to strike him on the mouth. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_3"><sup>3</sup>Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, <i>you</i> whitewashed wall! For you sit to judge me according to the law, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:35; Deut. 25:1, 2; John 7:51">⚓</a>do you command me to be struck contrary to the law?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_23_4"> <sup>4</sup>And those who stood by said, “Do you revile God’s high priest?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_23_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then Paul said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 5:17, 18">⚓</a>“I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:28; Eccl. 10:20; 2 Pet. 2:10">⚓</a>‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_23_6"> <sup>6</sup>But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, “Men <i>and</i> brethren, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 26:5; Phil. 3:5">⚓</a>I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 24:15, 21; 26:6; 28:20">⚓</a>concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_23_7"> <sup>7</sup>And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the assembly was divided. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:23; Mark 12:18; Luke 20:27">⚓</a>For Sadducees say that there is no resurrection—and no angel or spirit; but the Pharisees confess both. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_9"><sup>9</sup>Then there arose a loud outcry. And the scribes of the Pharisees’ party arose and protested, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 25:25; 26:31">⚓</a>“We find no evil in this man; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 12:29; Acts 22:6, 7, 17, 18">⚓</a>if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 5:39">⚓</a>let us not fight against God.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_23_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now when there arose a great dissension, the commander, fearing lest Paul might be pulled to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring <i>him</i> into the barracks.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Plot Against Paul</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_23_11"> <sup>11</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:9; 27:23, 24">⚓</a>the following night the Lord stood by him and said, <font color="red">“Be of good cheer, Paul; for as you have testified for Me in </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:18, 19; 22:1–21">⚓</a><font color="red">Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness at </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 28:16, 17, 23">⚓</a><font color="red">Rome.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_23_12"> <sup>12</sup>And when it was day, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:21, 30; 25:3">⚓</a>some of the Jews banded together and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:23, 24; 25:3; 26:21; 27:42; 1 Thess. 2:15">⚓</a>killed Paul. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_13"><sup>13</sup>Now there were more than forty who had formed this conspiracy. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_14"><sup>14</sup>They came to the chief priests and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:5, 23; 6:12; 22:5; 24:1; 25:15">⚓</a>elders, and said, “We have bound ourselves under a great oath that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_15"><sup>15</sup>Now you, therefore, together with the council, suggest to the commander that he be brought down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to make further inquiries concerning him; but we are ready to kill him before he comes near.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_23_16"> <sup>16</sup>So when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their ambush, he went and entered the barracks and told Paul. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_17"><sup>17</sup>Then Paul called one of the centurions to <i>him</i> and said, “Take this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_18"><sup>18</sup>So he took him and brought <i>him</i> to the commander and said, “Paul the prisoner called me to <i>him</i> and asked <i>me</i> to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_23_19"> <sup>19</sup>Then the commander took him by the hand, went aside, and asked privately, “What is it that you have to tell me?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_23_20"> <sup>20</sup>And he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:12">⚓</a>“The Jews have agreed to ask that you bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire more fully about him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_21"><sup>21</sup>But do not yield to them, for more than forty of them lie in wait for him, men who have bound themselves by an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him; and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_23_22"> <sup>22</sup>So the commander let the young man depart, and commanded <i>him,</i> “Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Sent to Felix</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_23_23"> <sup>23</sup>And he called for two centurions, saying, “Prepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:40; 23:33">⚓</a>Caesarea at the third hour of the night; </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_24"><sup>24</sup>and provide mounts to set Paul on, and bring <i>him</i> safely to Felix the governor.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_25"><sup>25</sup>He wrote a letter in the following manner:<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_23_26">  <sup>26</sup>Claudius Lysias,<br/>   To the most excellent governor Felix:<br/>   Greetings.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_23_27">   <sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:30, 33; 24:7">⚓</a>This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them. Coming with the troops I rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_28">   <sup>28</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:30">⚓</a>And when I wanted to know the reason they accused him, I brought him before their council. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_29">   <sup>29</sup>I found out that he was accused <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:15; 25:19">⚓</a>concerning questions of their law, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 25:25; 26:31">⚓</a>but had nothing charged against him deserving of death or chains. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_30">   <sup>30</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:20">⚓</a>when it was told me that the Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent him immediately to you, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 24:8; 25:6">⚓</a>also commanded his accusers to state before you the charges against him.<br/>   Farewell.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_23_31"> <sup>31</sup>Then the soldiers, as they were commanded, took Paul and brought <i>him</i> by night to Antipatris. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_32"><sup>32</sup>The next day they left the horsemen to go on with him, and returned to the barracks. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_33"><sup>33</sup>When they came to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:40">⚓</a>Caesarea and had delivered the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:26–30">⚓</a>letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_34"><sup>34</sup>And when the governor had read <i>it,</i> he asked what province he was from. And when he understood that <i>he</i> <i>was</i> from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:9; 21:39">⚓</a>Cilicia, </span>
<span class="verse cong_23_35"><sup>35</sup>he said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 24:1, 10; 25:16">⚓</a>“I will hear you when your accusers also have come.” And he commanded him to be kept in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:27">⚓</a>Herod’s Praetorium.<br/></span>
