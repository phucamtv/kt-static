<div class="title"><h1>24</h1><h3>Accused of Sedition</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_24_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now after <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:27">⚓</a>five days <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:2, 30, 35; 25:2">⚓</a>Ananias the high priest came down with the elders and a certain orator <i>named</i> Tertullus. These gave evidence to the governor against Paul.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_24_2"> <sup>2</sup>And when he was called upon, Tertullus began his accusation, saying: “Seeing that through you we enjoy great peace, and prosperity is being brought to this nation by your foresight, </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_3"><sup>3</sup>we accept <i>it</i> always and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_4"><sup>4</sup>Nevertheless, not to be tedious to you any further, I beg you to hear, by your courtesy, a few words from us. </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:2; Acts 6:13; 16:20; 17:6; 21:28; 1 Pet. 2:12, 15">⚓</a>For we have found this man a plague, a creator of dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:28">⚓</a>He even tried to profane the temple, and we seized him, and wanted <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 18:31">⚓</a>to judge him according to our law. </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:33; 23:10">⚓</a>But the commander Lysias came by and with great violence took <i>him</i> out of our hands, </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:30">⚓</a>commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_9"><sup>9</sup>And the Jews also assented, maintaining that these things were so.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Defense Before Felix</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_24_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: “Inasmuch as I know that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself, </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_11"><sup>11</sup>because you may ascertain that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:15, 18, 26, 27; 24:17">⚓</a>to worship. </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 25:8; 28:17">⚓</a>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with anyone nor inciting the crowd, either in the synagogues or in the city. </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_13"><sup>13</sup>Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me. </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_14"><sup>14</sup>But this I confess to you, that according to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 8:14; Acts 9:2; 24:22">⚓</a>the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 1:3">⚓</a>God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 26:22; 28:23">⚓</a>the Law and in the Prophets. </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:6; 26:6, 7; 28:20">⚓</a>I have hope in God, which they themselves also accept, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 12:2; John 5:28, 29; 11:24)">⚓</a>that there will be a resurrection of <i>the</i> dead, both of <i>the</i> just and <i>the</i> unjust. </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:1">⚓</a>This <i>being</i> so, I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_24_17"> <sup>17</sup>“Now after many years <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:29, 30; Rom. 15:25–28; 1 Cor. 16:1–4; 2 Cor. 8:1–4; 9:1, 2, 12; Gal. 2:10">⚓</a>I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation, </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:27; 26:21">⚓</a>in the midst of which some Jews from Asia found me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:26">⚓</a>purified in the temple, neither with a mob nor with tumult. </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 23:30; 25:16)">⚓</a>They ought to have been here before you to object if they had anything against me. </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_20"><sup>20</sup>Or else let those who are <i>here</i> themselves say if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council, </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_21"><sup>21</sup>unless <i>it</i> <i>is</i> for this one statement which I cried out, standing among them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 23:6; 24:15; 28:20)">⚓</a>‘Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you this day.’ ”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Felix Procrastinates</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_24_22"> <sup>22</sup>But when Felix heard these things, having more accurate knowledge of <i>the</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:2; 18:26; 19:9, 23; 22:4">⚓</a>Way, he adjourned the proceedings and said, “When <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:26; 24:7">⚓</a>Lysias the commander comes down, I will make a decision on your case.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_23"><sup>23</sup>So he commanded the centurion to keep Paul and to let <i>him</i> have liberty, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:16; 27:3; 28:16">⚓</a>told him not to forbid any of his friends to provide for or visit him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_24_24"> <sup>24</sup>And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 3:15; 5:24; 11:25; 12:46; 20:31; Rom. 10:9)">⚓</a>faith in Christ. </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_25"><sup>25</sup>Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and answered, “Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_24_26"><sup>26</sup>Meanwhile he also hoped that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:8">⚓</a>money would be given him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_24_27"> <sup>27</sup>But after two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix; and Felix, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 23:2; Acts 12:3; 23:35; 25:9, 14">⚓</a>wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul bound.<br/></span>
