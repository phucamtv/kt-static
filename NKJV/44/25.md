<div class="title"><h1>25</h1><h3>Paul Appeals to Caesar</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_25_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now when Festus had come to the province, after three days he went up from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:40; 25:4, 6, 13">⚓</a>Caesarea to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 24:1; 25:15">⚓</a>Then the high priest and the chief men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they petitioned him, </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_3"><sup>3</sup>asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:12, 15">⚓</a>while <i>they</i> lay in ambush along the road to kill him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_4"><sup>4</sup>But Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was going <i>there</i> shortly. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_5"><sup>5</sup>“Therefore,” he said, “let those who have authority among you go down with <i>me</i> and accuse this man, to see <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:14; 25:18">⚓</a>if there is any fault in him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_25_6"> <sup>6</sup>And when he had remained among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_7"><sup>7</sup>When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood about <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 15:3; Luke 23:2, 10; Acts 24:5, 13">⚓</a>and laid many serious complaints against Paul, which they could not prove, </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_8"><sup>8</sup>while he answered for himself, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:13; 24:12; 28:17">⚓</a>“Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended in anything at all.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_25_9"> <sup>9</sup>But Festus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 12:2; 24:27">⚓</a>wanting to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 25:20">⚓</a>“Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be judged before me concerning these things?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_25_10"> <sup>10</sup>So Paul said, “I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:14; 23:29; 25:25; 26:31">⚓</a>For if I am an offender, or have committed anything deserving of death, I do not object to dying; but if there is nothing in these things of which these men accuse me, no one can deliver me to them. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 26:32; 28:19">⚓</a>I appeal to Caesar.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_25_12"> <sup>12</sup>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, “You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go!”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Paul Before Agrippa</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_25_13"> <sup>13</sup>And after some days King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_14"><sup>14</sup>When they had been there many days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 24:27">⚓</a>“There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix, </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 24:1; 25:2, 3">⚓</a>about whom the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed <i>me,</i> when I was in Jerusalem, asking for a judgment against him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 25:4, 5">⚓</a>To them I answered, ‘It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to destruction before the accused meets the accusers face to face, and has opportunity to answer for himself concerning the charge against him.’ </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_17"><sup>17</sup>Therefore when they had come together, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:19; Acts 25:6, 10">⚓</a>without any delay, the next day I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_18"><sup>18</sup>When the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation against him of such things as I supposed, </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:14, 15; 23:29">⚓</a>but had some questions against him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_20"><sup>20</sup>And because I was uncertain of such questions, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_21"><sup>21</sup>But when Paul <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 25:11, 12">⚓</a>appealed to be reserved for the decision of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I could send him to Caesar.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_25_22"> <sup>22</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:15">⚓</a>Agrippa said to Festus, “I also would like to hear the man myself.”<br/> “Tomorrow,” he said, “you shall hear him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_25_23"> <sup>23</sup>So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and had entered the auditorium with the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at Festus’ command <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:15">⚓</a>Paul was brought in. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_24"><sup>24</sup>And Festus said: “King Agrippa and all the men who are here present with us, you see this man about whom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 25:2, 3, 7">⚓</a>the whole assembly of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out that he was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:36; 22:22">⚓</a>not fit to live any longer. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_25"><sup>25</sup>But when I found that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:9, 29; 26:31">⚓</a>he had committed nothing deserving of death, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 25:11, 12">⚓</a>and that he himself had appealed to Augustus, I decided to send him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_26"><sup>26</sup>I have nothing certain to write to my lord concerning him. Therefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the examination has taken place I may have something to write. </span>
<span class="verse cong_25_27"><sup>27</sup>For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to specify the charges against him.”<br/></span>
