<span class="verse cong_26_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You are permitted to speak for yourself.”<br/> So Paul stretched out his hand and answered for himself: </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_2"><sup>2</sup>“I think myself <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Pet. 3:14; 4:14)">⚓</a>happy, King Agrippa, because today I shall answer <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Pet. 3:15, 16)">⚓</a>for myself before you concerning all the things of which I am <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:28; 24:5, 6">⚓</a>accused by the Jews, </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_3"><sup>3</sup>especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which have to do with the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_26_4"> <sup>4</sup>“My manner of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know. </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_5"><sup>5</sup>They knew me from the first, if they were willing to testify, that according to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 22:3; 23:6; 24:15, 21); Phil. 3:5">⚓</a>the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:6">⚓</a>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 3:15; 22:18; 26:4; 49:10; Deut. 18:15; 2 Sam. 7:12; Ps. 132:11; Is. 4:2; 7:14; 9:6; 40:10; Jer. 23:5; 33:14–16; Ezek. 34:23; 37:24; Dan. 9:24); Acts 13:32; Rom. 15:8; (Titus 2:13)">⚓</a>the promise made by God to our fathers. </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_7"><sup>7</sup>To this <i>promise</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="James 1:1">⚓</a>our twelve tribes, earnestly serving <i>God</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:37; 1 Thess. 3:10; 1 Tim. 5:5">⚓</a>night and day, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 3:11">⚓</a>hope to attain. For this hope’s sake, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews. </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_8"><sup>8</sup>Why should it be thought incredible by you that God raises the dead?<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_26_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 16:2; 1 Cor. 15:9; 1 Tim. 1:12, 13">⚓</a>“Indeed, I myself thought I must do many things contrary to the name of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:22; 10:38">⚓</a>Jesus of Nazareth. </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:1–3; 9:13; Gal. 1:13">⚓</a>This I also did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I shut up in prison, having received authority <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:14">⚓</a>from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against <i>them.</i></span>
<span class="verse cong_26_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:17; Acts 22:19">⚓</a>And I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled <i>them</i> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted <i>them</i> even to foreign cities.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Paul Recounts His Conversion</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_26_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:3–8; 22:6–11; 26:12–18">⚓</a>“While thus occupied, as I journeyed to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_13"><sup>13</sup>at midday, O king, along the road I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me. </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_14"><sup>14</sup>And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language, <font color="red">‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? <i>It is</i> hard for you to kick against the goads.’</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_26_15"><sup>15</sup>So I said, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And He said, <font color="red">‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_26_16"><sup>16</sup><font color="red">But rise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:15; Eph. 3:6–8">⚓</a><font color="red">to make you a minister and a witness both of the things which you have seen and of the things which I will yet reveal to you.</font></span>
<span class="verse cong_26_17"><sup>17</sup><font color="red">I will deliver you from the <i>Jewish</i> people, as well as <i>from</i> the Gentiles, </font><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:21">⚓</a><font color="red">to whom I now send you,</font></span>

<div class="title"><h3>Paul’s Post-Conversion Life</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_26_19"> <sup>19</sup>“Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_20"><sup>20</sup>but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:19, 20, 22; 11:26">⚓</a>declared first to those in Damascus and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and <i>then</i> to the Gentiles, that they should repent, turn to God, and do <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 3:8; Luke 3:8">⚓</a>works befitting repentance. </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_21"><sup>21</sup>For these reasons the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill <i>me.</i></span>
<span class="verse cong_26_22"><sup>22</sup>Therefore, having obtained help from God, to this day I stand, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:27; Acts 24:14; 28:23; Rom. 3:21">⚓</a>which the prophets and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 5:46">⚓</a>Moses said would come— </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:26">⚓</a>that the Christ would suffer, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:20, 23; Col. 1:18; Rev. 1:5">⚓</a>that He would be the first to rise from the dead, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 42:6; 49:6; Luke 2:32; 2 Cor. 4:4">⚓</a>would proclaim light to the <i>Jewish</i> people and to the Gentiles.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Agrippa Parries Paul’s Challenge</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_26_24"> <sup>24</sup>Now as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “Paul, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 9:11; John 10:20; (1 Cor. 1:23; 2:13, 14; 4:10)">⚓</a>you are beside yourself! Much learning is driving you mad!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_26_25"> <sup>25</sup>But he said, “I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak the words of truth and reason. </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_26"><sup>26</sup>For the king, before whom I also speak freely, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 26:3">⚓</a>knows these things; for I am convinced that none of these things escapes his attention, since this thing was not done in a corner. </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_27"><sup>27</sup>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do believe.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_26_28"> <sup>28</sup>Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You almost persuade me to become a Christian.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_26_29"> <sup>29</sup>And Paul said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 7:7">⚓</a>“I would to God that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become both almost and altogether such as I am, except for these chains.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_26_30"> <sup>30</sup>When he had said these things, the king stood up, as well as the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them; </span>
<span class="verse cong_26_31"><sup>31</sup>and when they had gone aside, they talked among themselves, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:9, 29; 25:25">⚓</a>“This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_26_32"> <sup>32</sup>Then Agrippa said to Festus, “This man might have been set <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 28:18">⚓</a>free <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 25:11">⚓</a>if he had not appealed to Caesar.”<br/></span>
