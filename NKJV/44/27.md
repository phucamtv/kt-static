<div class="title"><h1>27</h1><h3>The Voyage to Rome Begins</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_27_1"> <sup>1</sup>And when <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 25:12, 25">⚓</a>it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to <i>one</i> named Julius, a centurion of the Augustan Regiment. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_2"><sup>2</sup>So, entering a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, meaning to sail along the coasts of Asia. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:29">⚓</a>Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_3"><sup>3</sup>And the next <i>day</i> we landed at Sidon. And Julius <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 24:23; 28:16">⚓</a>treated Paul kindly and gave <i>him</i> liberty to go to his friends and receive care. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_4"><sup>4</sup>When we had put to sea from there, we sailed under <i>the</i> <i>shelter</i> <i>of</i> Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_5"><sup>5</sup>And when we had sailed over the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, <i>a</i> <i>city</i> of Lycia. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_6"><sup>6</sup>There the centurion found <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 28:11">⚓</a>an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he put us on board.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_27_7"> <sup>7</sup>When we had sailed slowly many days, and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to proceed, we sailed under <i>the</i> <i>shelter</i> <i>of</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:11; 27:12, 21; Titus 1:5, 12">⚓</a>Crete off Salmone. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_8"><sup>8</sup>Passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city <i>of</i> Lasea.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Paul’s Warning Ignored</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_27_9"> <sup>9</sup>Now when much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 16:29–31; 23:27–29; Num. 29:7">⚓</a>because the Fast was already over, Paul advised them, </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_10"><sup>10</sup>saying, “Men, I perceive that this voyage will end with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and ship, but also our lives.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_11"><sup>11</sup>Nevertheless the centurion was more persuaded by the helmsman and the owner of the ship than by the things spoken by Paul. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_12"><sup>12</sup>And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to set sail from there also, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete opening toward the southwest and northwest, <i>and</i> winter <i>there.</i><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>In the Tempest</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_27_13"> <sup>13</sup>When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained <i>their</i> desire, putting out to sea, they sailed close by Crete. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_14"><sup>14</sup>But not long after, a tempestuous head wind arose, called Euroclydon. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_15"><sup>15</sup>So when the ship was caught, and could not head into the wind, we let <i>her</i> drive. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_16"><sup>16</sup>And running under <i>the</i> <i>shelter</i> <i>of</i> an island called Clauda, we secured the skiff with difficulty. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_17"><sup>17</sup>When they had taken it on board, they used cables to undergird the ship; and fearing lest they should run aground on the Syrtis <i>Sands,</i> they struck sail and so were driven. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_18"><sup>18</sup>And because we were exceedingly tempest-tossed, the next <i>day</i> they lightened the ship. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_19"><sup>19</sup>On the third <i>day</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jon. 1:5">⚓</a>we threw the ship’s tackle overboard with our own hands. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_20"><sup>20</sup>Now when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest beat on <i>us,</i> all hope that we would be saved was finally given up.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_27_21"> <sup>21</sup>But after long abstinence from food, then Paul stood in the midst of them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me, and not have sailed from Crete and incurred this disaster and loss. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_22"><sup>22</sup>And now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:9; 23:11; 2 Tim. 4:17">⚓</a>For there stood by me this night an angel of the God to whom I belong and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 6:16; Rom. 1:9; 2 Tim. 1:3">⚓</a>whom I serve, </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_24"><sup>24</sup>saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you.’ </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_25"><sup>25</sup>Therefore take heart, men, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:45; Rom. 4:20, 21; 2 Tim. 1:12">⚓</a>for I believe God that it will be just as it was told me. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_26"><sup>26</sup>However, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 28:1">⚓</a>we must run aground on a certain island.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_27_27"> <sup>27</sup>Now when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic <i>Sea,</i> about midnight the sailors sensed that they were drawing near some land. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_28"><sup>28</sup>And they took soundings and found <i>it</i> to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they took soundings again and found <i>it</i> to be fifteen fathoms. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_29"><sup>29</sup>Then, fearing lest we should run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern, and prayed for day to come. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_30"><sup>30</sup>And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, when they had let down the skiff into the sea, under pretense of putting out anchors from the prow, </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_31"><sup>31</sup>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_32"><sup>32</sup>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff and let it fall off.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_27_33"> <sup>33</sup>And as day was about to dawn, Paul implored <i>them</i> all to take food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day you have waited and continued without food, and eaten nothing. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_34"><sup>34</sup>Therefore I urge you to take nourishment, for this is for your survival, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 1:52; (Matt. 10:30; Luke 12:7; 21:18)">⚓</a>since not a hair will fall from the head of any of you.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_35"><sup>35</sup>And when he had said these things, he took bread and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 9:13; Matt. 15:36; Mark 8:6; John 6:11; (1 Tim. 4:3, 4)">⚓</a>gave thanks to God in the presence of them all; and when he had broken <i>it</i> he began to eat. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_36"><sup>36</sup>Then they were all encouraged, and also took food themselves. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_37"><sup>37</sup>And in all we were two hundred and seventy-six <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:41; 7:14; Rom. 13:1; 1 Pet. 3:20">⚓</a>persons on the ship. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_38"><sup>38</sup>So when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and threw out the wheat into the sea.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Shipwrecked on Malta</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_27_39"> <sup>39</sup>When it was day, they did not recognize the land; but they observed a bay with a beach, onto which they planned to run the ship if possible. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_40"><sup>40</sup>And they let go the anchors and left <i>them</i> in the sea, meanwhile loosing the rudder ropes; and they hoisted the mainsail to the wind and made for shore. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_41"><sup>41</sup>But striking a place where two seas met, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 11:25">⚓</a>they ran the ship aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the violence of the waves.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_27_42"> <sup>42</sup>And the soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape. </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_43"><sup>43</sup>But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, kept them from <i>their</i> purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should jump <i>overboard</i> first and get to land, </span>
<span class="verse cong_27_44"><sup>44</sup>and the rest, some on boards and some on <i>parts</i> of the ship. And so it was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 27:22, 31">⚓</a>that they all escaped safely to land.<br/></span>
