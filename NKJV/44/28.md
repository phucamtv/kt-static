<div class="title"><h1>28</h1><h3>Paul’s Ministry on Malta</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_28_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now when they had escaped, they then found out that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 27:26">⚓</a>the island was called Malta. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_2"><sup>2</sup>And the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 28:4; Rom. 1:14; 1 Cor. 14:11; Col. 3:11">⚓</a>natives showed us unusual kindness; for they kindled a fire and made us all welcome, because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_3"><sup>3</sup>But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid <i>them</i> on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_4"><sup>4</sup>So when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow to live.” </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_5"><sup>5</sup>But he shook off the creature into the fire and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:18; Luke 10:19">⚓</a>suffered no harm. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_6"><sup>6</sup>However, they were expecting that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had looked for a long time and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 12:22; 14:11">⚓</a>said that he was a god.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_28_7"> <sup>7</sup>In that region there was an estate of the leading citizen of the island, whose name was Publius, who received us and entertained us courteously for three days. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_8"><sup>8</sup>And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:40; (James 5:14, 15)">⚓</a>prayed, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:18; Mark 5:23; 6:5; 7:32; 16:18; Luke 4:40; Acts 19:11, 12; (1 Cor. 12:9, 28)">⚓</a>he laid his hands on him and healed him. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_9"><sup>9</sup>So when this was done, the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_10"><sup>10</sup>They also honored us in many <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 15:6; 1 Tim. 5:17">⚓</a>ways; and when we departed, they provided such things as were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Phil. 4:19)">⚓</a>necessary.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Arrival at Rome</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_28_11"> <sup>11</sup>After three months we sailed in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 27:6">⚓</a>an Alexandrian ship whose figurehead was the Twin Brothers, which had wintered at the island. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_12"><sup>12</sup>And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_13"><sup>13</sup>From there we circled round and reached Rhegium. And after one day the south wind blew; and the next day we came to Puteoli, </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_14"><sup>14</sup>where we found <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:8">⚓</a>brethren, and were invited to stay with them seven days. And so we went toward Rome. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_15"><sup>15</sup>And from there, when the brethren heard about us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Three Inns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_28_16"> <sup>16</sup>Now when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:11; 24:25; 27:3">⚓</a>Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Paul’s Ministry at Rome</h3></div>
<span class="verse cong_28_17"> <sup>17</sup>And it came to pass after three days that Paul called the leaders of the Jews together. So when they had come together, he said to them: “Men <i>and</i> brethren, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 23:29; 24:12, 13; 26:31">⚓</a>though I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:33">⚓</a>I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans, </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_18"><sup>18</sup>who, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:24; 24:10; 25:8; 26:32">⚓</a>when they had examined me, wanted to let <i>me</i> go, because there was no cause for putting me to death. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_19"><sup>19</sup>But when the Jews spoke against <i>it,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 25:11, 21, 25">⚓</a>I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything of which to accuse my nation. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_20"><sup>20</sup>For this reason therefore I have called for you, to see <i>you</i> and speak with <i>you,</i> because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 26:6, 7">⚓</a>for the hope of Israel I am bound with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 26:29; Eph. 3:1; 4:1; 6:20; 2 Tim. 1:8, 16; Philem. 10, 13">⚓</a>this chain.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_28_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then they said to him, “We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren who came reported or spoken any evil of you. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_22"><sup>22</sup>But we desire to hear from you what you think; for concerning this sect, we know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:34; Acts 24:5, 14; (1 Pet. 2:12; 3:16; 4:14, 16)">⚓</a>it is spoken against everywhere.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_28_23"> <sup>23</sup>So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at <i>his</i> lodging, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:27; (Acts 17:3; 19:8)">⚓</a>to whom he explained and solemnly testified of the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 26:6, 22">⚓</a>from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_24"><sup>24</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:4; 19:9">⚓</a>some were persuaded by the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved. </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_25"><sup>25</sup>So when they did not agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had said one word: “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers, </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_26"><sup>26</sup>saying,<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 6:9, 10; Jer. 5:21; Ezek. 12:2; Matt. 13:14, 15; Mark 4:12; Luke 8:10; John 12:40, 41; Rom. 11:8">⚓</a>‘Go to this people and say:<br/>   “Hearing you will hear, and shall not understand;<br/>   And seeing you will see, and not perceive;<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_28_27">   <sup>27</sup>For the hearts of this people have grown dull.<br/>   <i>Their</i> ears are hard of hearing,<br/>   And their eyes they have closed,<br/>   Lest they should see with <i>their</i> eyes and hear with <i>their</i> ears,<br/>   Lest they should understand with <i>their</i> hearts and turn,<br/>   So that I should heal them.” ’<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_28_28"> <sup>28</sup>“Therefore let it be known to you that the salvation of God has been sent <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 42:1, 6; 49:6; Matt. 21:41; Luke 2:32; Rom. 11:11">⚓</a>to the Gentiles, and they will hear it!” </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_29"><sup>29</sup>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed and had a great dispute among themselves.<br/></span>
<span class="verse cong_28_30"> <sup>30</sup>Then Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to him, </span>
<span class="verse cong_28_31"><sup>31</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 4:31; Eph. 6:19">⚓</a>preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no one forbidding him.<br/></span>
