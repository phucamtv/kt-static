<span class="verse ro_1_8"> <sup>8</sup>First, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:4; Eph. 1:15; Phil. 1:3; Col. 1:3; 1 Thess. 1:2; 2:13">⚓</a>I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 28:22; Rom. 16:19">⚓</a>your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. </span>

<span class="verse ro_1_10"><sup>10</sup>making request if, by some means, now at last I may find a way in the will of God to come to you. </span>
<span class="verse ro_1_11"><sup>11</sup>For I long to see you, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 15:29">⚓</a>I may impart to you some spiritual gift, so that you may be established— </span>

<span class="verse ro_1_15"><sup>15</sup>So, as much as is in me, <i>I</i> <i>am</i> ready to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Just Live by Faith</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_1_16"> <sup>16</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 40:9, 10">⚓</a>I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:18, 24">⚓</a>it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:30; Acts 3:26; Rom. 2:9">⚓</a>for the Jew first and also for the Greek. </span>

<div class="title"><h3>God’s Wrath on Unrighteousness</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_1_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 17:30)">⚓</a>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 6:13; 2 Thess. 2:10; 2 Pet. 2:13; 1 John 5:17">⚓</a>unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, </span>
<span class="verse ro_1_19"><sup>19</sup>because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 14:17; 17:24)">⚓</a>what may be known of God is manifest in them, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:9)">⚓</a>God has shown <i>it</i> to them. </span>
<span class="verse ro_1_20"><sup>20</sup>For since the creation of the world <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 12:7–9; Ps. 19:1–6; Jer. 5:22">⚓</a>His invisible <i>attributes</i> are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <i>even</i> His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, </span>
<span class="verse ro_1_21"><sup>21</sup>because, although they knew God, they did not glorify <i>Him</i> as God, nor were thankful, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 17:15; Jer. 2:5; Eph. 4:17">⚓</a>became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. </span>
<span class="verse ro_1_22"><sup>22</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 10:14; (1 Cor. 1:20)">⚓</a>Professing to be wise, they became fools, </span>
<span class="verse ro_1_23"><sup>23</sup>and changed the glory of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 1:17; 6:15, 16">⚓</a>incorruptible <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 4:16–18; Ps. 106:20; Jer. 2:11; Acts 17:29">⚓</a>God into an image made like corruptible man—and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_1_24"> <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 81:12; Acts 7:42; Eph. 4:18, 19">⚓</a>Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 6:18">⚓</a>to dishonor their bodies <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 18:22">⚓</a>among themselves, </span>
<span class="verse ro_1_25"><sup>25</sup>who exchanged <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 1:9">⚓</a>the truth of God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 44:20; Jer. 10:14; 13:25; 16:19">⚓</a>for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_1_26"> <sup>26</sup>For this reason God gave them up to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 18:22; Eph. 5:12">⚓</a>vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. </span>
<span class="verse ro_1_27"><sup>27</sup>Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_1_28"> <sup>28</sup>And even as they did not like to retain God in <i>their</i> knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 5:4">⚓</a>which are not fitting; </span>
<span class="verse ro_1_29"><sup>29</sup>being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; <i>they</i> <i>are</i> whisperers, </span>
<span class="verse ro_1_30"><sup>30</sup>backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, </span>
<span class="verse ro_1_31"><sup>31</sup>undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful; </span>
<span class="verse ro_1_32"><sup>32</sup>who, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 2:2)">⚓</a>knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 6:21)">⚓</a>are deserving of death, not only do the same but also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 50:18); Hos. 7:3">⚓</a>approve of those who practice them.<br/></span>
