<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Abraham Justified by Faith</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>What then shall we say that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 11:27—25:9; Is. 51:2; (Matt. 3:9); John 8:33">⚓</a>Abraham our <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 3:8); John 8:53; James 2:21">⚓</a>father has found according to the flesh? </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_2"><sup>2</sup>For if Abraham was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 3:20, 27">⚓</a>justified by works, he has <i>something</i> to boast about, but not before God. </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_3"><sup>3</sup>For what does the Scripture say? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:9, 22; Gal. 3:6; James 2:23">⚓</a>“Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_4"><sup>4</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 11:6">⚓</a>to him who works, the wages are not counted as grace but as debt.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>David Celebrates the Same Truth</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_4_5"> <sup>5</sup>But to him who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gal. 2:16; Eph. 2:8, 9)">⚓</a>does not work but believes on Him who justifies <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 24:2">⚓</a>the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness, </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_6"><sup>6</sup>just as David also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 32:1, 2">⚓</a>describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from works:<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_4_7">  <sup>7</sup>“Blessed<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 32:1, 2">⚓</a><i>are</i> <i>those</i> whose lawless deeds are forgiven,<br/>   And whose sins are covered;<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_4_8">   <sup>8</sup>Blessed <i>is</i> <i>the</i> man to whom the LORD shall not impute sin.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Abraham Justified Before Circumcision</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_4_9"> <sup>9</sup><i>Does</i> this blessedness then <i>come</i> upon the circumcised <i>only,</i> or upon the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness. </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_10"><sup>10</sup>How then was it accounted? While he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised. </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_11"><sup>11</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:10">⚓</a>he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <i>he</i> <i>had</i> <i>while</i> <i>still</i> uncircumcised, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 19:9; Rom. 4:16">⚓</a>he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are uncircumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also, </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_12"><sup>12</sup>and the father of circumcision to those who not only <i>are</i> of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of the faith which our father <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 4:18–22">⚓</a>Abraham <i>had</i> <i>while</i> <i>still</i> uncircumcised.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Promise Granted Through Faith</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_4_13"> <sup>13</sup>For the promise that he would be the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:4–6; 22:17">⚓</a>heir of the world <i>was</i> not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_14"><sup>14</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 3:18">⚓</a>if those who are of the law <i>are</i> heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect, </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_15"><sup>15</sup>because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 3:20">⚓</a>the law brings about wrath; for where there is no law <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no transgression.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_4_16"> <sup>16</sup>Therefore <i>it</i> <i>is</i> of faith that <i>it</i> <i>might</i> <i>be</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 3:24)">⚓</a>according to grace, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gal. 3:22)">⚓</a>so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 51:2">⚓</a>who is the father of us all </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_17"><sup>17</sup>(as it is written, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:5">⚓</a>“I have made you a father of many nations”) in the presence of Him whom he believed—God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 8:11)">⚓</a>who gives life to the dead and calls those <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 9:26">⚓</a>things which do not exist as though they did; </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_18"><sup>18</sup>who, contrary to hope, in hope believed, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was spoken, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:5">⚓</a>“So shall your descendants be.” </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_19"><sup>19</sup>And not being weak in faith, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 17:17">⚓</a>he did not consider his own body, already dead (since he was about a hundred years old), <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 11:11">⚓</a>and the deadness of Sarah’s womb. </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_20"><sup>20</sup>He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_21"><sup>21</sup>and being fully convinced that what He had promised <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:14; (Ps. 115:3; Luke 1:37; Heb. 11:19)">⚓</a>He was also able to perform. </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_22"><sup>22</sup>And therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:6">⚓</a>“it was accounted to him for righteousness.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_4_23"> <sup>23</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor. 10:6">⚓</a>it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him, </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_24"><sup>24</sup>but also for us. It shall be imputed to us who believe <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:24">⚓</a>in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, </span>
<span class="verse ro_4_25"><sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:4, 5; (Rom. 5:6, 8; 8:32; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 5:2; Heb. 9:28)">⚓</a>who was delivered up because of our offenses, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 5:18; 1 Cor. 15:17; 2 Cor. 5:15)">⚓</a>was raised because of our justification.<br/></span>
