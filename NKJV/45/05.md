<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Faith Triumphs in Trouble</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Therefore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 32:17; John 16:33">⚓</a>having been justified by faith, we have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 53:5); Acts 10:36; (Eph. 2:14)">⚓</a>peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 10:9; Eph. 2:18; 3:12; Heb. 10:19; 1 Pet. 3:18)">⚓</a>through whom also we have access by faith into this grace <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:1">⚓</a>in which we stand, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 3:6">⚓</a>rejoice in hope of the glory of God. </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_3"><sup>3</sup>And not only <i>that,</i> but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 5:11, 12; (John 16:33; Acts 5:41; 2 Cor. 12:9); James 1:2">⚓</a>we also glory in tribulations, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="James 1:3">⚓</a>knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 2:22; (James 1:12)">⚓</a>and perseverance, character; and character, hope. </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 1:20">⚓</a>Now hope does not disappoint, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 1:22; Eph. 1:13">⚓</a>because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Christ in Our Place</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_5_6"> <sup>6</sup>For when we were still without strength, in due time <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:5; (Rom. 4:25; 5:8; 8:32; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 5:2)">⚓</a>Christ died for the ungodly. </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_7"><sup>7</sup>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_8"><sup>8</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 3:16; 15:13; Rom. 8:39)">⚓</a>God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_9"><sup>9</sup>Much more then, having now been justified <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 2:13; (1 John 1:7)">⚓</a>by His blood, we shall be saved <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:18; 1 Thess. 1:10">⚓</a>from wrath through Him. </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_10"><sup>10</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 8:32)">⚓</a>if when we were enemies <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 11:28; 2 Cor. 5:18; (Eph. 2:5, 6); Col. 1:21">⚓</a>we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 14:19">⚓</a>by His life. </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_11"><sup>11</sup>And not only <i>that,</i> but we also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gal. 4:9)">⚓</a>rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Death in Adam, Life in Christ</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_5_12"> <sup>12</sup>Therefore, just as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:17; 3:6, 19; (Rom. 5:15–17; 1 Cor. 15:21)">⚓</a>through one man sin entered the world, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:17">⚓</a>death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned— </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_13"><sup>13</sup>(For until the law sin was in the world, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 John 3:4">⚓</a>sin is not imputed when there is no law. </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_14"><sup>14</sup>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 15:21, 22)">⚓</a>who is a type of Him who was to come. </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_15"><sup>15</sup>But the free gift <i>is</i> not like the offense. For if by the one man’s offense many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 53:11)">⚓</a>to many. </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_16"><sup>16</sup>And the gift <i>is</i> not like <i>that</i> <i>which</i> <i>came</i> through the one who sinned. For the judgment <i>which</i> <i>came</i> from one <i>offense</i> <i>resulted</i> in condemnation, but the free gift <i>which</i> <i>came</i> from many offenses <i>resulted</i> in justification. </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_17"><sup>17</sup>For if by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.)<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_5_18"> <sup>18</sup>Therefore, as through one man’s offense <i>judgment</i> <i>came</i> to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 15:21, 45)">⚓</a>one Man’s righteous act <i>the</i> <i>free</i> <i>gift</i> <i>came</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:21; (John 12:32)">⚓</a>to all men, resulting in justification of life. </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_19"><sup>19</sup>For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:11, 12; (Phil. 2:8)">⚓</a>one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_5_20"> <sup>20</sup>Moreover <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 15:22">⚓</a>the law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 7:47; Rom. 6:1; 1 Tim. 1:14">⚓</a>abounded much more, </span>
<span class="verse ro_5_21"><sup>21</sup>so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br/></span>
