<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Dead to Sin, Alive to God</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>What shall we say then? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 3:8; 6:15">⚓</a>Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_2"><sup>2</sup>Certainly not! How shall we who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 6:11; 7:4, 6; Gal. 2:19; Col. 2:20; 3:3); 1 Pet. 2:24">⚓</a>died to sin live any longer in it? </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_3"><sup>3</sup>Or do you not know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:38; 8:16; 19:5; (Gal. 3:27); Col. 2:12">⚓</a>as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 15:29)">⚓</a>were baptized into His death? </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_4"><sup>4</sup>Therefore we were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 2:12">⚓</a>buried with Him through baptism into death, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 6:14">⚓</a>just as Christ was raised from the dead by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 2:11">⚓</a>the glory of the Father, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 7:6; (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15; Eph. 4:23; Col. 3:10)">⚓</a>even so we also should walk in newness of life.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_6_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 4:10; Phil. 3:10; Col. 2:12; 3:1">⚓</a>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>likeness</i> of <i>His</i> resurrection, </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_6"><sup>6</sup>knowing this, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 2:20; 5:24; 6:14">⚓</a>our old man was crucified with <i>Him,</i> that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 2:11">⚓</a>the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_7"><sup>7</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Pet. 4:1">⚓</a>he who has died has been freed from sin. </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_8"><sup>8</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 6:4; 2 Cor. 4:10; 2 Tim. 2:11">⚓</a>if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_9"><sup>9</sup>knowing that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 1:18">⚓</a>Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_10"><sup>10</sup>For <i>the</i> <i>death</i> that He died, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 9:27">⚓</a>He died to sin once for all; but <i>the</i> <i>life</i> that He lives, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 20:38">⚓</a>He lives to God. </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_11"><sup>11</sup>Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 6:2; 7:4, 6)">⚓</a>dead indeed to sin, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gal. 2:19; Col. 2:20; 3:3); 1 Pet. 2:24">⚓</a>alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_6_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 19:13">⚓</a>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts. </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_13"><sup>13</sup>And do not present your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 6:16, 19; 7:5; Col. 3:5; James 4:1">⚓</a>members <i>as</i> instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 12:1; 2 Cor. 5:14; 1 Pet. 2:24; 4:2">⚓</a>present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members <i>as</i> instruments of righteousness to God. </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_14"><sup>14</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 7:4, 6; 8:2; Gal. 5:18)">⚓</a>sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>From Slaves of Sin to Slaves of God</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_6_15"> <sup>15</sup>What then? Shall we sin <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 9:21">⚓</a>because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not! </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_16"><sup>16</sup>Do you not know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 5:22; (Matt. 6:24); John 8:34; 2 Pet. 2:19">⚓</a>to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one’s slaves whom you obey, whether of sin <i>leading</i> to death, or of obedience <i>leading</i> to righteousness? </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_17"><sup>17</sup>But God be thanked that <i>though</i> you were slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from the heart <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 1:13">⚓</a>that form of doctrine to which you were delivered. </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_18"><sup>18</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:32; Rom. 6:22; 8:2; 1 Cor. 7:22; Gal. 5:1; 1 Pet. 2:16">⚓</a>having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_19"><sup>19</sup>I speak in human <i>terms</i> because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members <i>as</i> slaves of uncleanness, and of lawlessness <i>leading</i> to <i>more</i> lawlessness, so now present your members <i>as</i> slaves <i>of</i> righteousness for holiness.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_6_20"> <sup>20</sup>For when you were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:34">⚓</a>slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 12:13; Ezek. 16:63; Rom. 7:5">⚓</a>What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:32; Gal. 6:8">⚓</a>the end of those things <i>is</i> death. </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_22"><sup>22</sup>But now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 8:32); Rom. 6:18; 8:2">⚓</a>having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life. </span>
<span class="verse ro_6_23"><sup>23</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:17">⚓</a>the wages of sin <i>is</i> death, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 2:7; 1 Pet. 1:4">⚓</a>the gift of God <i>is</i> eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br/></span>
