<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>Freed from the Law</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>Or do you not know, brethren (for I speak to those who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives? </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_2"><sup>2</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 7:39">⚓</a>the woman who has a husband is bound by the law to <i>her</i> husband as long as he lives. But if the husband dies, she is released from the law of <i>her</i> husband. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_3"><sup>3</sup>So then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 5:32)">⚓</a>if, while <i>her</i> husband lives, she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she has married another man. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_4"><sup>4</sup>Therefore, my brethren, you also have become <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 8:2; Gal. 2:19; 5:18; (Col. 2:14)">⚓</a>dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another—to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 5:22">⚓</a>bear fruit to God. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_5"><sup>5</sup>For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were aroused by the law <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 6:13">⚓</a>were at work in our members <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 6:21; Gal. 5:19; James 1:15">⚓</a>to bear fruit to death. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_6"><sup>6</sup>But now we have been delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 2:29; 2 Cor. 3:6">⚓</a>in the newness of the Spirit and not <i>in</i> the oldness of the letter.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Sin’s Advantage in the Law</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_7_7"> <sup>7</sup>What shall we say then? <i>Is</i> the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 3:20">⚓</a>I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:17; Deut. 5:21; Acts 20:33">⚓</a>“You shall not covet.” </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_8"><sup>8</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 4:15">⚓</a>sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all <i>manner</i> <i>of</i> <i>evil</i> desire. For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:56">⚓</a>apart from the law sin <i>was</i> dead. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_9"><sup>9</sup>I was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_10"><sup>10</sup>And the commandment, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 18:5; Ezek. 20:11, 13, 21; Luke 10:28; Rom. 10:5; 2 Cor. 3:7; Gal. 3:12">⚓</a>which <i>was</i> to <i>bring</i> life, I found to <i>bring</i> death. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_11"><sup>11</sup>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed <i>me.</i></span>
<span class="verse ro_7_12"><sup>12</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 19:8">⚓</a>the law <i>is</i> holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Law Cannot Save from Sin</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_7_13"> <sup>13</sup>Has then what is good become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through what is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_14"><sup>14</sup>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 21:20, 25; 2 Kin. 17:17; Rom. 6:16">⚓</a>sold under sin. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_15"><sup>15</sup>For what I am doing, I do not understand. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 7:19; (Gal. 5:17)">⚓</a>For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate, that I do. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_16"><sup>16</sup>If, then, I do what I will not to do, I agree with the law that <i>it</i> <i>is</i> good. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_17"><sup>17</sup>But now, <i>it</i> <i>is</i> no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_18"><sup>18</sup>For I know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 6:5; 8:21)">⚓</a>in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but <i>how</i> to perform what is good I do not find. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_19"><sup>19</sup>For the good that I will <i>to</i> <i>do,</i> I do not do; but the evil I will not <i>to</i> <i>do,</i> that I practice. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_20"><sup>20</sup>Now if I do what I will not <i>to</i> <i>do,</i> it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_7_21"> <sup>21</sup>I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_22"><sup>22</sup>For I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 1:2">⚓</a>delight in the law of God according to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 4:16; Eph. 3:16; 1 Pet. 3:4)">⚓</a>the inward man. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_23"><sup>23</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 6:19; (Gal. 5:17); James 4:1; 1 Pet. 2:11">⚓</a>I see another law in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 6:13, 19">⚓</a>my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_24"><sup>24</sup>O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 15:51, 52; 1 Thess. 4:14–17)">⚓</a>from this body of death? </span>
<span class="verse ro_7_25"><sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:57">⚓</a>I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!<br/> So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.<br/></span>
