<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>Israel Needs the Gospel</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be saved. </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_2"><sup>2</sup>For I bear them witness <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 21:20; Gal. 1:14">⚓</a>that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_3"><sup>3</sup>For they being ignorant of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 1:17)">⚓</a>God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Phil. 3:9)">⚓</a>righteousness, have not submitted to the righteousness of God. </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_4"><sup>4</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 5:17; (Rom. 7:1–4; Gal. 3:24; 4:5)">⚓</a>Christ <i>is</i> the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_5"> <sup>5</sup>For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 18:5; Neh. 9:29; Ezek. 20:11, 13, 21; Rom. 7:10; Gal. 3:12">⚓</a>“The man who does those things shall live by them.” </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_6"><sup>6</sup>But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 30:12–14">⚓</a>“Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ down <i>from</i> <i>above</i>) </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_7"><sup>7</sup>or, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 30:13">⚓</a>“ ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_8"><sup>8</sup>But what does it say? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 30:14">⚓</a>“The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith which we preach): </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_9"><sup>9</sup>that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:32; Luke 12:8; Acts 8:37; Rom. 14:9; (1 Cor. 12:3); Phil. 2:11">⚓</a>if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_10"><sup>10</sup>For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_11"><sup>11</sup>For the Scripture says, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 28:16; Jer. 17:7; Rom. 9:33">⚓</a>“Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.” </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_12"><sup>12</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:9; Rom. 3:22, 29; Gal. 3:28">⚓</a>there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:36; 1 Tim. 2:5">⚓</a>the same Lord over all <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 1:7">⚓</a>is rich to all who call upon Him. </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_13"><sup>13</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Joel 2:32; Acts 2:21">⚓</a>“whoever calls <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:14">⚓</a>on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel Rejects the Gospel</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_10_14"> <sup>14</sup>How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 8:31; Titus 1:3">⚓</a>without a preacher? </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_15"><sup>15</sup>And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 52:7; Nah. 1:15">⚓</a>“How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace,<br/>   Who bring glad tidings of good things!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_16"> <sup>16</sup>But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:1; John 12:38">⚓</a>“LORD, who has believed our report?” </span>
<span class="verse ro_10_17"><sup>17</sup>So then faith <i>comes</i> by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_18"> <sup>18</sup>But I say, have they not heard? Yes indeed:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 19:4; Matt. 24:14; Mark 16:15; Rom. 1:8; Col. 1:6, 23; 1 Thess. 1:8">⚓</a>“Their sound has gone out to all the earth,<br/>   And their words to the ends of the world.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_19"> <sup>19</sup>But I say, did Israel not know? First Moses says:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:21; Rom. 11:11">⚓</a>“I will provoke you to jealousy by <i>those</i> <i>who</i> <i>are</i> not a nation,<br/>   I will move you to anger by a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Titus 3:3">⚓</a>foolish nation.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_20"> <sup>20</sup>But Isaiah is very bold and says:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 65:1; Rom. 9:30">⚓</a>“I was found by those who did not seek Me;<br/>   I was made manifest to those who did not ask for Me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_10_21"> <sup>21</sup>But to Israel he says:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 65:2">⚓</a>“All day long I have stretched out My hands<br/>   To a disobedient and contrary people.”<br/></span>
