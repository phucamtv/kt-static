<div class="title"><h1>11</h1><h3>Israel’s Rejection Not Total</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>I say then, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 94:14; Jer. 46:28">⚓</a>has God cast away His people? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 12:22; Jer. 31:37">⚓</a>Certainly not! For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 11:22; Phil. 3:5">⚓</a>I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, <i>of</i> the tribe of Benjamin. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_2"><sup>2</sup>God has not cast away His people whom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 8:29)">⚓</a>He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel, saying, </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:10, 14">⚓</a>“LORD, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life”? </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_4"><sup>4</sup>But what does the divine response say to him? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 19:18">⚓</a>“I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.” </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 19:4; Rom. 9:27">⚓</a>Even so then, at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_6"><sup>6</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 4:4">⚓</a>if by grace, then <i>it</i> <i>is</i> no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if <i>it</i> <i>is</i> of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_11_7"> <sup>7</sup>What then? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 9:31">⚓</a>Israel has not obtained what it seeks; but the elect have obtained it, and the rest were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:52; Rom. 9:18; 11:25; 2 Cor. 3:14">⚓</a>blinded. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_8"><sup>8</sup>Just as it is written:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 29:10, 13">⚓</a>“God has given them a spirit of stupor,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:3, 4; Is. 6:9; Matt. 13:13, 14; John 12:40; Acts 28:26, 27">⚓</a>Eyes that they should not see<br/>   And ears that they should not hear,<br/>   To this very day.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_11_9"> <sup>9</sup>And David says:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:22, 23">⚓</a>“Let their table become a snare and a trap,<br/>   A stumbling block and a recompense to them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_11_10">   <sup>10</sup>Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see,<br/>   And bow down their back always.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Israel’s Rejection Not Final</h3></div>
<span class="verse ro_11_11"> <sup>11</sup>I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? Certainly not! But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 42:6, 7; Acts 28:28">⚓</a>through their fall, to provoke them to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:21; Acts 13:46; Rom. 10:19">⚓</a>jealousy, salvation <i>has</i> <i>come</i> to the Gentiles. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_12"><sup>12</sup>Now if their fall <i>is</i> riches for the world, and their failure riches for the Gentiles, how much more their fullness!<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_11_13"> <sup>13</sup>For I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:15; 22:21; Gal. 1:16; 2:7–9; Eph. 3:8">⚓</a>I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_14"><sup>14</sup>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy <i>those</i> <i>who</i> <i>are</i> my flesh and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 9:22; 1 Tim. 4:16; James 5:20">⚓</a>save some of them. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_15"><sup>15</sup>For if their being cast away <i>is</i> the reconciling of the world, what <i>will</i> their acceptance <i>be</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 26:16–19)">⚓</a>but life from the dead?<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_11_16"> <sup>16</sup>For if <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 23:10; (James 1:18)">⚓</a>the firstfruit <i>is</i> holy, the lump <i>is</i> also <i>holy;</i> and if the root <i>is</i> holy, so <i>are</i> the branches. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_17"><sup>17</sup>And if <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 11:16; (John 15:2)">⚓</a>some of the branches were broken off, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:39; (Eph. 2:12)">⚓</a>and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them became a partaker of the root and fatness of the olive tree, </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 10:12)">⚓</a>do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, <i>remember</i> <i>that</i> you do not support the root, but the root <i>supports</i> you.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_11_19"> <sup>19</sup>You will say then, “Branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.” </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_20"><sup>20</sup>Well <i>said.</i> Because of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 3:19">⚓</a>unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be haughty, but fear. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_21"><sup>21</sup>For if God did not spare the natural branches, He may not spare you either. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_22"><sup>22</sup>Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:2; Heb. 3:6, 14">⚓</a>if you continue in <i>His</i> goodness. Otherwise <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 15:2)">⚓</a>you also will be cut off. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_23"><sup>23</sup>And they also, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 3:16)">⚓</a>if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_24"><sup>24</sup>For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, who <i>are</i> natural <i>branches,</i> be grafted into their own olive tree?<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_11_25"> <sup>25</sup>For I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 12:16">⚓</a>wise in your own opinion, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 3:14">⚓</a>blindness in part has happened to Israel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 21:24; John 10:16; Rom. 11:12">⚓</a>until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_26"><sup>26</sup>And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 14:7; Is. 59:20, 21">⚓</a>“The Deliverer will come out of Zion,<br/>   And He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_11_27">   <sup>27</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 27:9; Heb. 8:12">⚓</a>this <i>is</i> My covenant with them,<br/>   When I take away their sins.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_11_28"> <sup>28</sup>Concerning the gospel <i>they</i> <i>are</i> enemies for your sake, but concerning the election <i>they</i> <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 7:8; 10:15; Rom. 9:5">⚓</a>beloved for the sake of the fathers. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_29"><sup>29</sup>For the gifts and the calling of God <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 23:19">⚓</a>irrevocable. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_30"><sup>30</sup>For as you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 2:2)">⚓</a>were once disobedient to God, yet have now obtained mercy through their disobedience, </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_31"><sup>31</sup>even so these also have now been disobedient, that through the mercy shown you they also may obtain mercy. </span>
<span class="verse ro_11_32"><sup>32</sup>For God has committed them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 3:9; (Gal. 3:22)">⚓</a>all to disobedience, that He might have mercy on all.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_11_33"> <sup>33</sup>Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable <i>are</i> His judgments and His ways past finding out!<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_11_34">  <sup>34</sup>“For who has known the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 40:13; Jer. 23:18; 1 Cor. 2:16">⚓</a>mind of the Lord?<br/>   Or <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 36:22">⚓</a>who has become His counselor?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_11_35">   <sup>35</sup>“Or<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 41:11">⚓</a> who has first given to Him<br/>   And it shall be repaid to him?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ro_11_36"> <sup>36</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 8:6; 11:12); Col. 1:16; Heb. 2:10">⚓</a>of Him and through Him and to Him <i>are</i> all things, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 13:21">⚓</a>to whom <i>be</i> glory forever. Amen.<br/></span>
