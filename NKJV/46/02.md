<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Christ Crucified</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_2"><sup>2</sup>For I determined not to know anything among you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:23; Gal. 6:14">⚓</a>except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:1">⚓</a>I was with you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 4:7)">⚓</a>in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_4"><sup>4</sup>And my speech and my preaching <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 1:16">⚓</a><i>were</i> not with persuasive words of human wisdom, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 15:19; 1 Cor. 4:20">⚓</a>but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, </span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_5"><sup>5</sup>that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:16; 1 Thess. 1:5">⚓</a>power of God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Spiritual Wisdom</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_2_6"> <sup>6</sup>However, we speak wisdom among those who are mature, yet not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_7"><sup>7</sup>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden <i>wisdom</i> which God ordained before the ages for our glory, </span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_8"><sup>8</sup>which none of the rulers of this age knew; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:34">⚓</a>had they known, they would not have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:33–50">⚓</a>crucified the Lord of glory.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_9"> <sup>9</sup>But as it is written:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 64:4; 65:17)">⚓</a>“Eye has not seen, nor ear heard,<br/>   Nor have entered into the heart of man<br/>   The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_10"> <sup>10</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 11:25; 13:11; 16:17; (Gal. 1:12; Eph. 3:3, 5)">⚓</a>God has revealed <i>them</i> to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_11"><sup>11</sup>For what man knows the things of a man except the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 32:8; Eccl. 12:7; (1 Cor. 6:20; James 2:26)">⚓</a>spirit of the man which is in him? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 11:33">⚓</a>Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_12"><sup>12</sup>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 8:15)">⚓</a>the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_13"> <sup>13</sup>These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:23">⚓</a>But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know <i>them,</i> because they are spiritually discerned. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_15"><sup>15</sup>But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is <i>rightly</i> judged by no one. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_2_16"><sup>16</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 15:8; Is. 40:13; Rom. 11:34">⚓</a>“who has known the mind of the LORD that he may instruct Him?” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 15:15)">⚓</a>But we have the mind of Christ.<br/></span>
