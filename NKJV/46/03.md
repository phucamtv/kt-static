<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Sectarianism Is Carnal</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual <i>people</i> but as to carnal, as to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 2:6; Eph. 4:14; Heb. 5:13">⚓</a>babes in Christ. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_2"><sup>2</sup>I fed you with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 5:12; 1 Pet. 2:2">⚓</a>milk and not with solid food; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 16:12">⚓</a>for until now you were not able <i>to</i> <i>receive</i> <i>it,</i> and even now you are still not able; </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_3"><sup>3</sup>for you are still carnal. For where <i>there</i> <i>are</i> envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like <i>mere</i> men? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_4"><sup>4</sup>For when one says, “I am of Paul,” and another, “I <i>am</i> of Apollos,” are you not carnal?<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Watering, Working, Warning</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_3_5"> <sup>5</sup>Who then is Paul, and who <i>is</i> Apollos, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 15:16; 2 Cor. 3:3, 6; 4:1; 5:18; 6:4; Eph. 3:7; Col. 1:25; 1 Tim. 1:12">⚓</a>ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord gave to each one? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:4; 1 Cor. 4:15; 9:1; 15:1; 2 Cor. 10:14">⚓</a>I planted, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:24–27; 1 Cor. 1:12">⚓</a>Apollos watered, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 3:5)">⚓</a>but God gave the increase. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_7"><sup>7</sup>So then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 12:11; (Gal. 6:3)">⚓</a>neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_8"><sup>8</sup>Now he who plants and he who waters are one, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 62:12; Rom. 2:6">⚓</a>and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_9"> <sup>9</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:20; Acts 15:4; 2 Cor. 6:1">⚓</a>we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, <i>you</i> <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 3:16; Eph. 2:20–22); Col. 2:7; Heb. 3:3, 4; (1 Pet. 2:5)">⚓</a>God’s building. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:5">⚓</a>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 4:15">⚓</a>the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_11"><sup>11</sup>For no other foundation can anyone lay than <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 28:16; Matt. 16:18; 2 Cor. 11:4">⚓</a>that which is laid, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 2:20; 1 Pet. 2:4">⚓</a>which is Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_12"><sup>12</sup>Now if anyone builds on this foundation <i>with</i> gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_13"><sup>13</sup>each one’s work will become clear; for the Day <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Pet. 1:7">⚓</a>will declare it, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 3:1–3; Luke 2:35">⚓</a>it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one’s work, of what sort it is. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_14"><sup>14</sup>If anyone’s work which he has built on <i>it</i> endures, he will receive a reward. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_15"><sup>15</sup>If anyone’s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 8:9; 1 Cor. 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16; Eph. 2:21">⚓</a>Do you not know that you are the temple of God and <i>that</i> the Spirit of God dwells in you? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_17"><sup>17</sup>If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which <i>temple</i> you are.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Avoid Worldly Wisdom</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_3_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 3:7">⚓</a>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_19"><sup>19</sup>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 5:13">⚓</a>“He catches the wise in their <i>own</i> craftiness”; </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_20"><sup>20</sup>and again, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 94:11">⚓</a>“The LORD knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.” </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_21"><sup>21</sup>Therefore let no one boast in men. For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 4:5)">⚓</a>all things are yours: </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_22"><sup>22</sup>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come—all are yours. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_3_23"><sup>23</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 14:8); 1 Cor. 15:23; 2 Cor. 10:7; (Gal. 3:29)">⚓</a>you <i>are</i> Christ’s, and Christ <i>is</i> God’s.<br/></span>
