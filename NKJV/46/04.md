<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>Stewards of the Mysteries of God</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Let a man so consider us, as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 24:45; Rom. 13:6; 2 Cor. 3:6; Col. 1:25">⚓</a>servants of Christ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 12:42; 1 Cor. 9:17; Titus 1:7; 1 Pet. 4:10">⚓</a>and stewards of the mysteries of God. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_2"><sup>2</sup>Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_3"><sup>3</sup>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by a human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_4"><sup>4</sup>For I know of nothing against myself, yet I am not justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 7:1; Rom. 2:1; (Rev. 20:12)">⚓</a>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:26">⚓</a>light the hidden things of darkness and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 3:13">⚓</a>reveal the counsels of the hearts. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 2:29; 1 Cor. 3:8; (2 Cor. 5:10)">⚓</a>Then each one’s praise will come from God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Fools for Christ’s Sake</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_4_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us not to think beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up on behalf of one against the other. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_7"><sup>7</sup>For who makes you differ <i>from</i> <i>another?</i> And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 3:27; Rom. 12:3, 6; 1 Pet. 4:10">⚓</a>what do you have that you did not receive? Now if you did indeed receive <i>it,</i> why do you boast as if you had not received <i>it?</i><br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_8"> <sup>8</sup>You are already full! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 3:17">⚓</a>You are already rich! You have reigned as kings without us—and indeed I could wish you did reign, that we also might reign with you! </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_9"><sup>9</sup>For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last, as men condemned to death; for we have been made a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 10:33">⚓</a>spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_10"><sup>10</sup>We <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 17:18; 26:24; 1 Cor. 1:18">⚓</a>fools for Christ’s sake, but you <i>are</i> wise in Christ! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 2:3; 2 Cor. 13:9">⚓</a>We <i>are</i> weak, but you <i>are</i> strong! You <i>are</i> distinguished, but we <i>are</i> dishonored! </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_11"><sup>11</sup>To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and we are poorly clothed, and beaten, and homeless. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:3; 20:34">⚓</a>And we labor, working with our own hands. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 5:44">⚓</a>Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure; </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_13"><sup>13</sup>being defamed, we entreat. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lam. 3:45">⚓</a>We have been made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things until now.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Paul’s Paternal Care</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_4_14"> <sup>14</sup>I do not write these things to shame you, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 6:13; 12:14; 1 Thess. 2:11; 1 John 2:1; 3 John 4">⚓</a>as my beloved children I warn <i>you.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_15"><sup>15</sup>For though you might have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet <i>you</i> <i>do</i> not <i>have</i> many fathers; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:12; Acts 18:11; 1 Cor. 3:8; Gal. 4:19; Philem. 10">⚓</a>in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_16"><sup>16</sup>Therefore I urge you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 11:1); Phil. 3:17; 4:9; (1 Thess. 1:6); 2 Thess. 3:9">⚓</a>imitate me. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_17"><sup>17</sup>For this reason I have sent <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:22; Phil. 2:19">⚓</a>Timothy to you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 4:14; 1 Tim. 1:2, 18; 2 Tim. 1:2">⚓</a>who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 11:2">⚓</a>remind you of my ways in Christ, as I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 7:17; Titus 1:5">⚓</a>teach everywhere <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 14:33">⚓</a>in every church.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 5:2">⚓</a>Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:21; 20:2; 1 Cor. 11:34; 16:5, 7–9; 2 Cor. 1:15">⚓</a>But I will come to you shortly, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 18:21; Heb. 6:3; James 4:15">⚓</a>if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_20"><sup>20</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 1:5">⚓</a>the kingdom of God <i>is</i> not in word but in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 2:4">⚓</a>power. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_4_21"><sup>21</sup>What do you want? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 10:2">⚓</a>Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?<br/></span>
