<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Immorality Defiles the Church</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>It is actually reported <i>that</i> <i>there</i> <i>is</i> sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles—that a man has his father’s <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 18:6–8; Deut. 22:30; 27:20">⚓</a>wife! </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 4:18">⚓</a>And you are puffed up, and have not rather <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 7:7–10">⚓</a>mourned, that he who has done this deed might be taken away from among you. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 2:5; 1 Thess. 2:17">⚓</a>For I indeed, as absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged (as though I were present) him who has so done this deed. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_4"><sup>4</sup>In the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 18:20)">⚓</a>name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 16:19; John 20:23); 2 Cor. 12:9">⚓</a>with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 109:6; Prov. 23:14; Luke 22:31; 1 Tim. 1:20">⚓</a>deliver such a one to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 26:18)">⚓</a>Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_6"> <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 3:21">⚓</a>Your glorying <i>is</i> not good. Do you not know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hos. 7:4; Matt. 16:6, 12; Gal. 5:9; 2 Tim. 2:17">⚓</a>a little leaven leavens the whole lump? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_7"><sup>7</sup>Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened. For indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:7">⚓</a>Christ, our <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 19:14">⚓</a>Passover, was sacrificed for us. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_8"><sup>8</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:15">⚓</a>let us keep the feast, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 16:3">⚓</a>not with old leaven, nor <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:6">⚓</a>with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened <i>bread</i> of sincerity and truth.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Immorality Must Be Judged</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_5_9"> <sup>9</sup>I wrote to you in my epistle <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 6:14; Eph. 5:11; 2 Thess. 3:6">⚓</a>not to keep company with sexually immoral people. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_10"><sup>10</sup>Yet <i>I</i> certainly <i>did</i> not <i>mean</i> with the sexually immoral people of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, since then you would need to go <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 17:15">⚓</a>out of the world. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_11"><sup>11</sup>But now I have written to you not to keep company <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:17">⚓</a>with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 2:12">⚓</a>not even to eat with such a person.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_12"> <sup>12</sup>For what <i>have</i> I <i>to</i> <i>do</i> with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_5_13"><sup>13</sup>But those who are outside God judges. Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:5; 17:7, 12; 19:19; 21:21; 22:21, 24; 24:7; 1 Cor. 5:2">⚓</a>“put away from yourselves the evil person.”<br/></span>
