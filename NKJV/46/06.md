<span class="verse 1co_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:22; Matt. 19:28">⚓</a>saints? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_6_2"><sup>2</sup>Do you not know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 49:14">⚓</a>the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_6_3"><sup>3</sup>Do you not know that we shall <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 2:4">⚓</a>judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_6_4"><sup>4</sup>If then you have judgments concerning things pertaining to this life, do you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_6_5"><sup>5</sup>I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you, not even one, who will be able to judge between his brethren? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_6_6"><sup>6</sup>But brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers!<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_6_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now therefore, it is already an utter failure for you that you go to law against one another. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 20:22)">⚓</a>Why do you not rather accept wrong? Why do you not rather <i>let</i> <i>yourselves</i> be cheated? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_6_8"><sup>8</sup>No, you yourselves do wrong and cheat, and <i>you</i> <i>do</i> these things <i>to</i> <i>your</i> brethren! </span>

Do not be deceived. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:32; (1 Cor. 15:50); Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5; 1 Tim. 1:9">⚓</a>Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, </span>
<span class="verse 1co_6_10"><sup>10</sup>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_6_11"><sup>11</sup>And such were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 12:2; Col. 3:5–7; Titus 3:3–7)">⚓</a>some of you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 10:22">⚓</a>But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.<br/></span>
