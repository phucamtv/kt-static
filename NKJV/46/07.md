<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>Principles of Marriage</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now concerning the things of which you wrote to me:<br/> <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 7:8, 26">⚓</a><i>It</i> <i>is</i> good for a man not to touch a woman. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_2"><sup>2</sup>Nevertheless, because of sexual immorality, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 21:10">⚓</a>Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_4"><sup>4</sup>The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband <i>does.</i> And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife <i>does.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Joel 2:16">⚓</a>Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 3:5">⚓</a>Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_6"><sup>6</sup>But I say this as a concession, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 8:8">⚓</a>not as a commandment. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_7"><sup>7</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 26:29">⚓</a>I wish that all men were even as I myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_8"> <sup>8</sup>But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 7:1, 26">⚓</a>It is good for them if they remain even as I am; </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_9"><sup>9</sup>but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 5:14">⚓</a>if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn <i>with</i> <i>passion.</i><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Keep Your Marriage Vows</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_7_10"> <sup>10</sup>Now to the married I command, <i>yet</i> not I but the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 10:6–10">⚓</a>Lord: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 2:14; (Matt. 5:32)">⚓</a>A wife is not to depart from <i>her</i> husband. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_11"><sup>11</sup>But even if she does depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to <i>her</i> husband. And a husband is not to divorce <i>his</i> wife.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_12"> <sup>12</sup>But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is willing to live with him, let him not divorce her. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_13"><sup>13</sup>And a woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is willing to live with her, let her not divorce him. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_14"><sup>14</sup>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezra 9:2; Mal. 2:15">⚓</a>your children would be unclean, but now they are holy. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_15"><sup>15</sup>But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such <i>cases.</i> But God has called us <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 12:18">⚓</a>to peace. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_16"><sup>16</sup>For how do you know, O wife, whether you will <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 11:14; 1 Pet. 3:1">⚓</a>save <i>your</i> husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save <i>your</i> wife?<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Live as You Are Called</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_7_17"> <sup>17</sup>But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 4:17">⚓</a>so I ordain in all the churches. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_18"><sup>18</sup>Was anyone called while circumcised? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:1">⚓</a>Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 2:27, 29; Gal. 3:28; 5:6; 6:15; Col. 3:11)">⚓</a>Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 15:14)">⚓</a>keeping the commandments of God <i>is</i> <i>what</i> <i>matters.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_20"><sup>20</sup>Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_21"><sup>21</sup>Were you called <i>while</i> a slave? Do not be concerned about it; but if you can be made free, rather use <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_22"><sup>22</sup>For he who is called in the Lord <i>while</i> a slave is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 8:36); Rom. 6:18; Philem. 16">⚓</a>the Lord’s freedman. Likewise he who is called <i>while</i> free is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 9:21; Gal. 5:13); Eph. 6:6; Col. 3:24; 1 Pet. 2:16">⚓</a>Christ’s slave. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 25:42; 1 Cor. 6:20; 1 Pet. 1:18, 19; Rev. 5:9">⚓</a>You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_24"><sup>24</sup>Brethren, let each one remain with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 6:5–8; Col. 3:22–24)">⚓</a>God in that <i>state</i> in which he was called.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>To the Unmarried and Widows</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_7_25"> <sup>25</sup>Now concerning virgins: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 8:8">⚓</a>I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give judgment as one <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 4:1; 1 Tim. 1:13, 16">⚓</a>whom the Lord in His mercy has made <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 1:12">⚓</a>trustworthy. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_26"><sup>26</sup>I suppose therefore that this is good because of the present distress—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 7:1, 8">⚓</a>that <i>it</i> <i>is</i> good for a man to remain as he is: </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_27"><sup>27</sup>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_28"><sup>28</sup>But even if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh, but I would spare you.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_29"> <sup>29</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 13:11); 1 Cor. 7:31; 1 Pet. 4:7; (2 Pet. 3:8, 9)">⚓</a>this I say, brethren, the time <i>is</i> short, so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they had none, </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_30"><sup>30</sup>those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess, </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_31"><sup>31</sup>and those who use this world as not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 9:18">⚓</a>misusing <i>it.</i> For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 39:6; 1 Cor. 7:29; James 1:10; 4:14; 1 Pet. 1:24; 4:7; (1 John 2:17)">⚓</a>the form of this world is passing away.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_32"> <sup>32</sup>But I want you to be without care. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 5:5">⚓</a>He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord—how he may please the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_33"><sup>33</sup>But he who is married cares about the things of the world—how he may please <i>his</i> wife. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_34"><sup>34</sup>There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:40">⚓</a>cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world—how she may please <i>her</i> husband. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_35"><sup>35</sup>And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_36"> <sup>36</sup>But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of youth, and thus it must be, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin; let them marry. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_37"><sup>37</sup>Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so determined in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_38"><sup>38</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 13:4">⚓</a>So then he who gives <i>her</i> in marriage does well, but he who does not give <i>her</i> in marriage does better.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_39"> <sup>39</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 7:2">⚓</a>A wife is bound by law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 6:14">⚓</a>only in the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_7_40"><sup>40</sup>But she is happier if she remains as she is, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 7:6, 25">⚓</a>according to my judgment—and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 4:8">⚓</a>I think I also have the Spirit of God.<br/></span>
