<span class="verse 1co_11_1"> <sup>1</sup>Imitate<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 5:1">⚓</a> me, just as I also <i>imitate</i> Christ.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Head Coverings</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_11_2"> <sup>2</sup>Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions just as I delivered <i>them</i> to you. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_3"><sup>3</sup>But I want you to know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 1:22; 4:15; 5:23; Col. 1:18; 2:19">⚓</a>the head of every man is Christ, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:16; (Eph. 5:23)">⚓</a>the head of woman <i>is</i> man, and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 14:28">⚓</a>head of Christ <i>is</i> God. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_4"><sup>4</sup>Every man praying or <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 12:10">⚓</a>prophesying, having <i>his</i> head covered, dishonors his head. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_5"><sup>5</sup>But every woman who prays or prophesies with <i>her</i> head uncovered dishonors her head, for that is one and the same as if her head were <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 21:12">⚓</a>shaved. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_6"><sup>6</sup>For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 5:18">⚓</a>shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_7"><sup>7</sup>For a man indeed ought not to cover <i>his</i> head, since <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:26, 27; 5:1; 9:6; James 3:9">⚓</a>he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_8"><sup>8</sup>For man is not from woman, but woman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:21–23; 1 Tim. 2:13">⚓</a>from man. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_9"><sup>9</sup>Nor was man created for the woman, but woman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:18">⚓</a>for the man. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_10"><sup>10</sup>For this reason the woman ought to have <i>a</i> <i>symbol</i> <i>of</i> authority on <i>her</i> head, because of the angels. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_11"><sup>11</sup>Nevertheless, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gal. 3:28)">⚓</a>neither <i>is</i> man independent of woman, nor woman independent of man, in the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_12"><sup>12</sup>For as woman <i>came</i> from man, even so man also <i>comes</i> through woman; but all things are from God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_13"> <sup>13</sup>Judge among yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_14"><sup>14</sup>Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_15"><sup>15</sup>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her; for <i>her</i> hair is given to her for a covering. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_16"><sup>16</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 6:4">⚓</a>if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 7:17">⚓</a>nor <i>do</i> the churches of God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Conduct at the Lord’s Supper</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_11_17"> <sup>17</sup>Now in giving these instructions I do not praise <i>you,</i> since you come together not for the better but for the worse. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_18"><sup>18</sup>For first of all, when you come together as a church, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:10–12; 3:3">⚓</a>I hear that there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_19"><sup>19</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:7; Luke 17:1; 1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Pet. 2:1">⚓</a>there must also be factions among you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Deut. 13:3); Luke 2:35; 1 John 2:19">⚓</a>that those who are approved may be recognized among you. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_20"><sup>20</sup>Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_21"><sup>21</sup>For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of <i>others;</i> and one is hungry and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 2:13; Jude 12">⚓</a>another is drunk. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_22"><sup>22</sup>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 10:32">⚓</a>the church of God and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="James 2:6">⚓</a>shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise <i>you.</i><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Institution of the Lord’s Supper</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_11_23"> <sup>23</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:3; Gal. 1:12; Col. 3:24">⚓</a>I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:26–28; Mark 14:22–24; Luke 22:17–20; 1 Cor. 10:16">⚓</a>that the Lord Jesus on the <i>same</i> night in which He was betrayed took bread; </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_24"><sup>24</sup>and when He had given thanks, He broke <i>it</i> and said, <font color="red">“Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”</font></span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_25"><sup>25</sup>In the same manner <i>He</i> also <i>took</i> the cup after supper, saying, <font color="red">“This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink <i>it,</i> in remembrance of Me.”</font><br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_26"> <sup>26</sup>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 14:3; (Acts 1:11)">⚓</a>till He comes.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Examine Yourself</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_11_27"> <sup>27</sup>Therefore whoever eats <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 6:51)">⚓</a>this bread or drinks <i>this</i> cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_28"><sup>28</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:22; 2 Cor. 13:5; Gal. 6:4">⚓</a>let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_29"><sup>29</sup>For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_30"><sup>30</sup>For this reason many <i>are</i> weak and sick among you, and many sleep. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_31"><sup>31</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 32:5; 1 John 1:9)">⚓</a>if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_32"><sup>32</sup>But when we are judged, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 7:14; Ps. 94:12; (Heb. 12:5–10; Rev. 3:19)">⚓</a>we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_33"> <sup>33</sup>Therefore, my brethren, when you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 14:26">⚓</a>come together to eat, wait for one another. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_11_34"><sup>34</sup>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come.<br/></span>
