<div class="title"><h1>14</h1><h3>Prophecy and Tongues</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_14_1"> <sup>1</sup>Pursue love, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 12:31; 14:39">⚓</a>desire spiritual <i>gifts,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:25, 29">⚓</a>but especially that you may prophesy. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_2"><sup>2</sup>For he who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:4; 10:46">⚓</a>speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God, for no one understands <i>him;</i> however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_3"><sup>3</sup>But he who prophesies speaks <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 14:19; 15:2; 2 Cor. 10:8; 12:19; Eph. 4:12, 29">⚓</a>edification and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 4:13; 2 Tim. 4:2; Titus 1:9; 2:15; Heb. 3:13; 10:25">⚓</a>exhortation and comfort to men. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_4"><sup>4</sup>He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_5"><sup>5</sup>I wish you all spoke with tongues, but even more that you prophesied; for he who prophesies <i>is</i> greater than he who speaks with tongues, unless indeed he interprets, that the church may receive edification.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Tongues Must Be Interpreted</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_14_6"> <sup>6</sup>But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 14:26; Eph. 1:17">⚓</a>revelation, by knowledge, by prophesying, or by teaching? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_7"><sup>7</sup>Even things without life, whether flute or harp, when they make a sound, unless they make a distinction in the sounds, how will it be known what is piped or played? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_8"><sup>8</sup>For if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound, who will prepare for battle? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_9"><sup>9</sup>So likewise you, unless you utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_10"><sup>10</sup>There are, it may be, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them <i>is</i> without significance. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_11"><sup>11</sup>Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a foreigner to him who speaks, and he who speaks <i>will</i> <i>be</i> a foreigner to me. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_12"><sup>12</sup>Even so you, since you are zealous for spiritual <i>gifts, let it be</i> for the edification of the church <i>that</i> you seek to excel.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_13"> <sup>13</sup>Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 12:10">⚓</a>interpret. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_14"><sup>14</sup>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_15"><sup>15</sup>What is <i>the</i> <i>conclusion</i> then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the understanding. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16">⚓</a>I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 47:7">⚓</a>with the understanding. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_16"><sup>16</sup>Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say “Amen” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 27:15–26; 1 Chr. 16:36; Neh. 5:13; 8:6; Ps. 106:48; Jer. 11:5; 28:6; 1 Cor. 11:24; Rev. 5:14; 7:12">⚓</a>at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_17"><sup>17</sup>For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_18"> <sup>18</sup>I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all; </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_19"><sup>19</sup>yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Tongues a Sign to Unbelievers</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_14_20"> <sup>20</sup>Brethren, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 131:2; (Matt. 11:25; 18:3; 19:14); Rom. 16:19; 1 Cor. 3:1; Eph. 4:14; Heb. 5:12, 13">⚓</a>do not be children in understanding; however, in malice <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 18:3; 1 Pet. 2:2)">⚓</a>be babes, but in understanding be mature.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 10:34; 1 Cor. 14:34">⚓</a>In the law it is written:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 28:11, 12">⚓</a>“With <i>men</i> <i>of</i> other tongues and other lips<br/>   I will speak to this people;<br/>   And yet, for all that, they will not hear Me,”<br/> says the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_22"> <sup>22</sup>Therefore tongues are for a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:17">⚓</a>sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_23"><sup>23</sup>Therefore if the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in <i>those</i> <i>who</i> <i>are</i> uninformed or unbelievers, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:13">⚓</a>will they not say that you are out of your mind? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_24"><sup>24</sup>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an uninformed person comes in, he is convinced by all, he is convicted by all. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_25"><sup>25</sup>And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed; and so, falling down on <i>his</i> face, he will worship God and report <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 45:14; Dan. 2:47; Zech. 8:23; Acts 4:13">⚓</a>that God is truly among you.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Order in Church Meetings</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1co_14_26"> <sup>26</sup>How is it then, brethren? Whenever you come together, each of you has a psalm, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 12:8–10; 14:6">⚓</a>has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 12:7; (2 Cor. 12:19)">⚓</a>Let all things be done for edification. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_27"><sup>27</sup>If anyone speaks in a tongue, <i>let</i> <i>there</i> <i>be</i> two or at the most three, <i>each</i> in turn, and let one interpret. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_28"><sup>28</sup>But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_29"><sup>29</sup>Let two or three prophets speak, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 12:10">⚓</a>let the others judge. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_30"><sup>30</sup>But if <i>anything</i> is revealed to another who sits by, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Thess. 5:19, 20)">⚓</a>let the first keep silent. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_31"><sup>31</sup>For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_32"><sup>32</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 John 4:1">⚓</a>the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_33"><sup>33</sup>For God is not <i>the</i> <i>author</i> of confusion but of peace, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 11:16">⚓</a>as in all the churches of the saints.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_34"> <sup>34</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 2:11; 1 Pet. 3:1">⚓</a>Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but <i>they</i> <i>are</i> to be submissive, as the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:16">⚓</a>law also says. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_35"><sup>35</sup>And if they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_36"> <sup>36</sup>Or did the word of God come <i>originally</i> from you? Or <i>was</i> <i>it</i> you only that it reached? </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_37"><sup>37</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 10:7; (1 John 4:6)">⚓</a>If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_38"><sup>38</sup>But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_39"> <sup>39</sup>Therefore, brethren, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 12:31; 1 Thess. 5:20">⚓</a>desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues. </span>
<span class="verse 1co_14_40"><sup>40</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 14:33">⚓</a>Let all things be done decently and in order.<br/></span>
