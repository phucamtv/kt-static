<span class="verse 2co_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>But I determined this within myself, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 1:23">⚓</a>that I would not come again to you in sorrow. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_2"><sup>2</sup>For if I make you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 7:8">⚓</a>sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Forgive the Offender</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_2_3"> <sup>3</sup>And I wrote this very thing to you, lest, when I came, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 4:21; 2 Cor. 12:21">⚓</a>I should have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 8:22; Gal. 5:10; 2 Thess. 3:4; Philem. 21">⚓</a>having confidence in you all that my joy is <i>the</i> <i>joy</i> of you all. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_4"><sup>4</sup>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 2:9; 7:8, 12)">⚓</a>not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 5:1)">⚓</a>if anyone has caused grief, he has not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 4:12">⚓</a>grieved me, but all of you to some extent—not to be too severe. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_6"><sup>6</sup>This punishment which <i>was</i> <i>inflicted</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 5:4, 5; 2 Cor. 7:11; 1 Tim. 5:20">⚓</a>by the majority <i>is</i> sufficient for such a man, </span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 6:1; Eph. 4:32">⚓</a>so that, on the contrary, you <i>ought</i> rather to forgive and comfort <i>him</i>, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_8"><sup>8</sup>Therefore I urge you to reaffirm <i>your</i> love to him. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_9"><sup>9</sup>For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 7:15; 10:6">⚓</a>obedient in all things. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_10"><sup>10</sup>Now whom you forgive anything, I also <i>forgive</i>. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, </span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_11"><sup>11</sup>lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Triumph in Christ</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_2_12"> <sup>12</sup>Furthermore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:8">⚓</a>when I came to Troas to <i>preach</i> Christ’s gospel, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 16:9">⚓</a>a door was opened to me by the Lord, </span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 7:6, 13; 8:6; Gal. 2:1, 3; 2 Tim. 4:10; Titus 1:4">⚓</a>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_14"> <sup>14</sup>Now thanks <i>be</i> to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_15"><sup>15</sup>For we are to God the fragrance of Christ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 1:18)">⚓</a>among those who are being saved and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 4:3)">⚓</a>among those who are perishing. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 2:34; (John 9:39; 1 Pet. 2:7)">⚓</a>To the one <i>we</i> <i>are</i> the aroma of death <i>leading</i> to death, and to the other the aroma of life <i>leading</i> to life. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 15:10)">⚓</a>who <i>is</i> sufficient for these things? </span>
<span class="verse 2co_2_17"><sup>17</sup>For we are not, as so many, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 2:3">⚓</a>peddling the word of God; but as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 5:8; 2 Cor. 1:12; 1 Thess. 2:4; 1 Pet. 4:11">⚓</a>of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ.<br/></span>
