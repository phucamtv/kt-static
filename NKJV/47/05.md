<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Assurance of the Resurrection</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>For we know that if <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 4:19; 1 Cor. 15:47; 2 Cor. 4:7">⚓</a>our earthly house, <i>this</i> tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 14:58; Acts 7:48; Heb. 9:11, 24">⚓</a>not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_2"><sup>2</sup>For in this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 8:23; 2 Cor. 5:4">⚓</a>we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven, </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_3"><sup>3</sup>if indeed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 3:18">⚓</a>having been clothed, we shall not be found naked. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_4"><sup>4</sup>For we who are in <i>this</i> tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:53">⚓</a>but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_5"><sup>5</sup>Now He who has prepared us for this very thing <i>is</i> God, who also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 8:23; (2 Cor. 1:22); Eph. 1:14">⚓</a>has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_6"> <sup>6</sup>So <i>we</i> <i>are</i> always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_7"><sup>7</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 8:24; Heb. 11:1">⚓</a>we walk by faith, not by sight. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_8"><sup>8</sup>We are confident, yes, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 1:23">⚓</a>well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Judgment Seat of Christ</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_5_9"> <sup>9</sup>Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing to Him. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:27; Acts 10:42; Rom. 2:16; 14:10, 12">⚓</a>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 6:7; Eph. 6:8">⚓</a>that each one may receive the things <i>done</i> in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_11"><sup>11</sup>Knowing, therefore, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 10:31; 12:29; Jude 23)">⚓</a>the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are well known to God, and I also trust are well known in your consciences.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Be Reconciled to God</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_5_12"> <sup>12</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 3:1">⚓</a>we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give you opportunity <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 1:14; Phil. 1:26">⚓</a>to boast on our behalf, that you may have <i>an</i> <i>answer</i> for those who boast in appearance and not in heart. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_13"><sup>13</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 3:21; 2 Cor. 11:1, 16; 12:11">⚓</a>if we are beside ourselves, <i>it</i> <i>is</i> for God; or if we are of sound mind, <i>it</i> <i>is</i> for you. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_14"><sup>14</sup>For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 5:15; 6:6; Gal. 2:20; Col. 3:3)">⚓</a>if One died for all, then all died; </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_15"><sup>15</sup>and He died for all, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 6:11)">⚓</a>that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 10:3">⚓</a>Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 12:50)">⚓</a>yet now we know <i>Him</i> <i>thus</i> no longer. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_17"><sup>17</sup>Therefore, if anyone <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 6:63)">⚓</a><i>is</i> in Christ, <i>he</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 8:9)">⚓</a>a new creation; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 43:18; 65:17; (Eph. 4:24); Rev. 21:4">⚓</a>old things have passed away; behold, all things have become <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 6:3–10; Col. 3:3)">⚓</a>new. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_18"><sup>18</sup>Now all things <i>are</i> of God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 5:10; (Eph. 2:16; Col. 1:20)">⚓</a>who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_19"><sup>19</sup>that is, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 3:24)">⚓</a>God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_20"> <sup>20</sup>Now then, we are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 2:7; Eph. 6:20">⚓</a>ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore <i>you</i> on Christ’s behalf, be reconciled to God. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_5_21"><sup>21</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:6, 9">⚓</a>He made Him who knew no sin <i>to</i> <i>be</i> sin for us, that we might become <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 1:17; 3:21); 1 Cor. 1:30">⚓</a>the righteousness of God in Him.<br/></span>
