<span class="verse 2co_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>Therefore,<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 John 3:3)">⚓</a> having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Corinthians’ Repentance</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_7_2"> <sup>2</sup>Open <i>your</i> <i>hearts</i> to us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:33">⚓</a>we have cheated no one. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_7_3"><sup>3</sup>I do not say <i>this</i> to condemn; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 6:11, 12">⚓</a>I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_7_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 3:12">⚓</a>Great <i>is</i> my boldness of speech toward you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:4">⚓</a>great <i>is</i> my boasting on your behalf. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 2:17; Col. 1:24">⚓</a>I am filled with comfort. I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2co_7_5"> <sup>5</sup>For indeed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 15:26; 2 Cor. 2:13">⚓</a>when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 4:8">⚓</a>we were troubled on every side. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 32:25">⚓</a>Outside <i>were</i> conflicts, inside <i>were</i> fears. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_7_6"><sup>6</sup>Nevertheless <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 49:13; 2 Cor. 1:3, 4">⚓</a>God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 2:13; 7:13">⚓</a>the coming of Titus, </span>
<span class="verse 2co_7_7"><sup>7</sup>and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us of your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2co_7_8"> <sup>8</sup>For even if I made you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 2:2">⚓</a>sorry with my letter, I do not regret it; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 2:4">⚓</a>though I did regret it. For I perceive that the same epistle made you sorry, though only for a while. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_7_9"><sup>9</sup>Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_7_10"><sup>10</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 12:13; Ps. 32:10; Matt. 26:75">⚓</a>godly sorrow produces repentance <i>leading</i> to salvation, not to be regretted; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 17:22">⚓</a>but the sorrow of the world produces death. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_7_11"><sup>11</sup>For observe this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it produced in you, <i>what</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 5:11">⚓</a>clearing of yourselves, what indignation, <i>what</i> fear, <i>what</i> vehement desire, <i>what</i> zeal, <i>what</i> vindication! In all <i>things</i> you proved yourselves to be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 2:5–11">⚓</a>clear in this matter. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_7_12"><sup>12</sup>Therefore, although I wrote to you, <i>I</i> <i>did</i> not <i>do</i> <i>it</i> for the sake of him who had done the wrong, nor for the sake of him who suffered wrong, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 2:4">⚓</a>but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Joy of Titus</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_7_13"> <sup>13</sup>Therefore we have been comforted in your comfort. And we rejoiced exceedingly more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 15:32">⚓</a>has been refreshed by you all. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_7_14"><sup>14</sup>For if in anything I have boasted to him about you, I am not ashamed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting to Titus was found true. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_7_15"><sup>15</sup>And his affections are greater for you as he remembers <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 2:9; Phil. 2:12">⚓</a>the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_7_16"><sup>16</sup>Therefore I rejoice that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 2:3; 8:22; 2 Thess. 3:4; Philem. 8, 21">⚓</a>I have confidence in you in everything.<br/></span>
