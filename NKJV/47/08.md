<span class="verse 2co_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia: </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_2"><sup>2</sup>that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 12:44">⚓</a>their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their liberality. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_3"><sup>3</sup>For I bear witness that according to <i>their</i> ability, yes, and beyond <i>their</i> ability, <i>they</i> <i>were</i> freely willing, </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_4"><sup>4</sup>imploring us with much urgency that we would receive the gift and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:29; 24:17; Rom. 15:25, 26; 1 Cor. 16:1, 3, 4; 2 Cor. 9:1">⚓</a>the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_5"><sup>5</sup>And not <i>only</i> as we had hoped, but they first <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 12:1, 2)">⚓</a>gave themselves to the Lord, and <i>then</i> to us by the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 6:6)">⚓</a>will of God. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_6"><sup>6</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 8:17; 12:18">⚓</a>we urged Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also complete this grace in you as well. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_7"><sup>7</sup>But as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 1:5; 12:13)">⚓</a>you abound in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us—<i>see</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 9:8">⚓</a>that you abound in this grace also.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Christ Our Pattern</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_8_8"> <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 7:6">⚓</a>I speak not by commandment, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by the diligence of others. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_9"><sup>9</sup>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 8:20; Luke 9:58; Phil. 2:6, 7">⚓</a>that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 9:23; (Eph. 1:7; Rev. 3:18)">⚓</a>rich.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_10"> <sup>10</sup>And in this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 7:25, 40">⚓</a>I give advice: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 19:17; Matt. 10:42; 1 Tim. 6:18, 19; Heb. 13:16)">⚓</a>It is to your advantage not only to be doing what you began and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 16:2; 2 Cor. 9:2">⚓</a>were desiring to do a year ago; </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_11"><sup>11</sup>but now you also must complete the doing <i>of</i> <i>it;</i> that as <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a readiness to desire <i>it,</i> so <i>there</i> also <i>may</i> <i>be</i> a completion out of what <i>you</i> have. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_12"><sup>12</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 12:43, 44; Luke 21:3, 4; 2 Cor. 9:7">⚓</a>if there is first a willing mind, <i>it</i> <i>is</i> accepted according to what one has, <i>and</i> not according to what he does not have.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_13"> <sup>13</sup>For <i>I</i> <i>do</i> not mean that others should be eased and you burdened; </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_14"><sup>14</sup>but by an equality, <i>that</i> now at this time your abundance <i>may</i> <i>supply</i> their lack, that their abundance also may <i>supply</i> your lack—that there may be equality. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_15"><sup>15</sup>As it is written, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:18">⚓</a>“He who <i>gathered</i> much had nothing left over, and he who <i>gathered</i> little had no lack.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Collection for the Judean Saints</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_8_16"> <sup>16</sup>But thanks <i>be</i> to God who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_17"><sup>17</sup>For he not only accepted the exhortation, but being more diligent, he went to you of his own accord. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_18"><sup>18</sup>And we have sent with him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 16:3; 2 Cor. 12:18">⚓</a>the brother whose praise <i>is</i> in the gospel throughout all the churches, </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_19"><sup>19</sup>and not only <i>that,</i> but who was also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:23; 1 Cor. 16:3, 4">⚓</a>chosen by the churches to travel with us with this gift, which is administered by us <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 4:15">⚓</a>to the glory of the Lord Himself and <i>to</i> <i>show</i> your ready mind, </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_20"><sup>20</sup>avoiding this: that anyone should blame us in this lavish gift which is administered by us— </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 12:17; Phil. 4:8; 1 Pet. 2:12">⚓</a>providing honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_22"> <sup>22</sup>And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, because of the great confidence which <i>we</i> <i>have</i> in you. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_23"><sup>23</sup>If <i>anyone</i> <i>inquires</i> about <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 7:13, 14">⚓</a>Titus, <i>he</i> <i>is</i> my partner and fellow worker concerning you. Or if our brethren <i>are</i> <i>inquired</i> <i>about, they are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 13:16); Phil. 2:25">⚓</a>messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_8_24"><sup>24</sup>Therefore show to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love and of our <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 7:4, 14; 9:2">⚓</a>boasting on your behalf.<br/></span>
