<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>The Vision of Paradise</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. I will come to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:9; 18:9; 22:17, 18; 23:11; 26:13–15; 27:23">⚓</a>visions and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:3–6; 1 Cor. 14:6; 2 Cor. 12:7; (Gal. 1:12; 2:2; Eph. 3:3–6)">⚓</a>revelations of the Lord: </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_2"><sup>2</sup>I know a man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 16:7; Gal. 1:22">⚓</a>in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows—such a one <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 22:17">⚓</a>was caught up to the third heaven. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_3"><sup>3</sup>And I know such a man—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows— </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_4"><sup>4</sup>how he was caught up into <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 23:43; (Rev. 2:7)">⚓</a>Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_5"><sup>5</sup>Of such a one I will boast; yet of myself I will not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 11:30">⚓</a>boast, except in my infirmities. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_6"><sup>6</sup>For though I might desire to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, lest anyone should think of me above what he sees me <i>to</i> <i>be</i> or hears from me.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Thorn in the Flesh</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_12_7"> <sup>7</sup>And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 33:55; Ezek. 28:24; Hos. 2:6; Gal. 4:13, 14">⚓</a>thorn in the flesh was given to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 2:7; Matt. 4:10; Luke 13:16; (1 Cor. 5:5)">⚓</a>a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_8"><sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 3:23; Matt. 26:44">⚓</a>Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_9"><sup>9</sup>And He said to me, <font color="red">“My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.”</font> Therefore most gladly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 11:30">⚓</a>I will rather boast in my infirmities, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Pet. 4:14)">⚓</a>that the power of Christ may rest upon me. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_10"><sup>10</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 5:3; 8:35)">⚓</a>I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 13:4">⚓</a>For when I am weak, then I am strong.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Signs of an Apostle</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2co_12_11"> <sup>11</sup>I have become <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 5:13; 11:1, 16; 12:6">⚓</a>a fool in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 11:5">⚓</a>in nothing was I behind the most eminent apostles, though <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 3:7; 13:2; 15:9">⚓</a>I am nothing. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:3; Rom. 15:18">⚓</a>Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance, in signs and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:12">⚓</a>wonders and mighty <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:8–10; 16:16–18; 19:11, 12; 20:6–12; 28:1–10">⚓</a>deeds. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_13"><sup>13</sup>For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong!<br/></span>

<span class="verse 2co_12_15"><sup>15</sup>And I will very gladly spend and be spent <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 10:11; Rom. 9:3; 2 Cor. 1:6; Phil. 2:17; Col. 1:24; 1 Thess. 2:8; (2 Tim. 2:10)">⚓</a>for your souls; though <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 6:12, 13">⚓</a>the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_16"> <sup>16</sup>But be that <i>as</i> <i>it</i> <i>may,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 11:9">⚓</a>I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning! </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_17"><sup>17</sup>Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you? </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_18"><sup>18</sup>I urged Titus, and sent our <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 8:18">⚓</a>brother with <i>him.</i> Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did <i>we</i> not <i>walk</i> in the same steps?<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_19"> <sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 5:12">⚓</a>Again, do you think that we excuse ourselves to you? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 9:1, 2); 2 Cor. 11:31">⚓</a>We speak before God in Christ. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 10:33">⚓</a>But <i>we</i> <i>do</i> all things, beloved, for your edification. </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_20"><sup>20</sup>For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and <i>that</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 4:21; 2 Cor. 13:2, 10">⚓</a>I shall be found by you such as you do not wish; lest <i>there</i> <i>be</i> contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, backbitings, whisperings, conceits, tumults; </span>
<span class="verse 2co_12_21"><sup>21</sup>lest, when I come again, my God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 2:1, 4">⚓</a>will humble me among you, and I shall mourn for many <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 13:2">⚓</a>who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 5:1">⚓</a>fornication, and lewdness which they have practiced.<br/></span>
