<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Defending the Gospel</h3></div>
<span class="verse ga_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then after fourteen years <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:2">⚓</a>I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and also took Titus with <i>me.</i></span>
<span class="verse ga_2_2"><sup>2</sup>And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:1–4">⚓</a>privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 9:16; 1 Cor. 9:24); Gal. 5:7; Phil. 2:16; 1 Thess. 3:5; 2 Tim. 4:7; Heb. 12:1">⚓</a>I might run, or had run, in vain. </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_3"><sup>3</sup>Yet not even Titus who <i>was</i> with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_4"><sup>4</sup>And <i>this</i> <i>occurred</i> because of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:1, 24; 2 Cor. 11:13, 26; Gal. 1:7">⚓</a>false brethren secretly brought in (who came in by stealth to spy out our <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 3:25; 5:1, 13; (James 1:25)">⚓</a>liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 4:3, 9">⚓</a>that they might bring us into bondage), </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_5"><sup>5</sup>to whom we did not yield submission even for an hour, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gal. 1:6; 2:14; 3:1); Col. 1:5">⚓</a>the truth of the gospel might continue with you.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ga_2_6"> <sup>6</sup>But from those <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 2:9; 6:3">⚓</a>who seemed to be something—whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:34; Rom. 2:11">⚓</a>God shows personal favoritism to no man—for those who seemed <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>something</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 11:5; 12:11">⚓</a>added nothing to me. </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_7"><sup>7</sup>But on the contrary, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:15; 13:46; 22:21; Rom. 11:13">⚓</a>when they saw that the gospel for the uncircumcised <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 9:17; 1 Thess. 2:4; 1 Tim. 1:11">⚓</a>had been committed to me, as <i>the</i> <i>gospel</i> for the circumcised <i>was</i> to Peter </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_8"><sup>8</sup>(for He who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Pet. 1:1">⚓</a>circumcised <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 9:15">⚓</a>also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gal. 3:5)">⚓</a>worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles), </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_9"><sup>9</sup>and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 16:18">⚓</a>pillars, perceived <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:5">⚓</a>the grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:3">⚓</a>that we <i>should</i> <i>go</i> to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_10"><sup>10</sup><i>They</i> <i>desired</i> only that we should remember the poor, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:30">⚓</a>the very thing which I also was eager to do.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>No Return to the Law</h3></div>
<span class="verse ga_2_11"> <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 15:35">⚓</a>Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_12"><sup>12</sup>for before certain men came from James, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 10:28; 11:2, 3)">⚓</a>he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_13"><sup>13</sup>And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ga_2_14"> <sup>14</sup>But when I saw that they were not straightforward about <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 1:6; 2:5; Col. 1:5">⚓</a>the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 5:20">⚓</a>before <i>them</i> all, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 10:28); Gal. 2:12">⚓</a>“If you, being a Jew, live in the manner of Gentiles and not as the Jews, why do you compel Gentiles to live as Jews? </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 15:10)">⚓</a>We <i>who</i> <i>are</i> Jews by nature, and not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 9:11">⚓</a>sinners of the Gentiles, </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:38, 39; Gal. 3:11">⚓</a>knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:17">⚓</a>by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 143:2; Rom. 3:20">⚓</a>by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ga_2_17"> <sup>17</sup>“But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 John 3:8)">⚓</a>sinners, <i>is</i> Christ therefore a minister of sin? Certainly not! </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_18"><sup>18</sup>For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_19"><sup>19</sup>For I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 8:2">⚓</a>through the law <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 6:2, 14; 7:4); 1 Cor. 9:20">⚓</a>died to the law that I might <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 6:11)">⚓</a>live to God. </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_20"><sup>20</sup>I have been <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 6:6; Gal. 5:24; 6:14)">⚓</a>crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the <i>life</i> which I now live in the flesh <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 6:8–11; 2 Cor. 5:15; (Eph. 2:4–6; Col. 3:1–4)">⚓</a>I live by faith in the Son of God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:12; Eph. 5:2">⚓</a>who loved me and gave Himself for me. </span>
<span class="verse ga_2_21"><sup>21</sup>I do not set aside the grace of God; for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 7:11">⚓</a>if righteousness <i>comes</i> through the law, then Christ died in vain.”<br/></span>
