<span class="verse ga_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now I say <i>that</i> the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all, </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_2"><sup>2</sup>but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_3"><sup>3</sup>Even so we, when we were children, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 4:9; Col. 2:8, 20; Heb. 5:12; 9:10">⚓</a>were in bondage under the elements of the world. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_4"><sup>4</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gen. 49:10)">⚓</a>when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:14); Rom. 1:3; 8:3; (Phil. 2:7)">⚓</a>born <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:15; (Is. 7:14; Matt. 1:25)">⚓</a>of a woman, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 5:17); Luke 2:21, 27">⚓</a>born under the law, </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 20:28; Gal. 3:13)">⚓</a>to redeem those who were under the law, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:12)">⚓</a>that we might receive the adoption as sons.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ga_4_6"> <sup>6</sup>And because you are sons, God has sent forth <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 16:7; Rom. 5:5; 8:9, 15, 16; 2 Cor. 3:17)">⚓</a>the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!” </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_7"><sup>7</sup>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 8:16, 17)">⚓</a>and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Fears for the Church</h3></div>
<span class="verse ga_4_8"> <sup>8</sup>But then, indeed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:21; Eph. 2:12; 1 Thess. 4:5; 2 Thess. 1:8">⚓</a>when you did not know God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:25">⚓</a>you served those which by nature are not gods. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_9"><sup>9</sup>But now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 8:3)">⚓</a>after you have known God, or rather are known by God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 3:1–3; Col. 2:20">⚓</a>how <i>is</i> <i>it</i> <i>that</i> you turn again to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 7:18">⚓</a>the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage? </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 14:5; Col. 2:16">⚓</a>You observe days and months and seasons and years. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_11"><sup>11</sup>I am afraid for you, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 3:5">⚓</a>lest I have labored for you in vain.<br/></span>
<span class="verse ga_4_12"> <sup>12</sup>Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I <i>became</i> like you. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 2:5">⚓</a>You have not injured me at all. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_13"><sup>13</sup>You know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 2:3">⚓</a>because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_14"><sup>14</sup>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mal. 2:7">⚓</a>as an angel of God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 10:16)">⚓</a><i>even</i> as Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_15"><sup>15</sup>What then was the blessing you <i>enjoyed?</i> For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_16"><sup>16</sup>Have I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth?<br/></span>
<span class="verse ga_4_17"> <sup>17</sup>They <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 10:2">⚓</a>zealously court you, <i>but</i> for no good; yes, they want to exclude you, that you may be zealous for them. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_18"><sup>18</sup>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 4:15">⚓</a>My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you, </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_20"><sup>20</sup>I would like to be present with you now and to change my tone; for I have doubts about you.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Two Covenants</h3></div>
<span class="verse ga_4_21"> <sup>21</sup>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law? </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_22"><sup>22</sup>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:15">⚓</a>the one by a bondwoman, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:2">⚓</a>the other by a freewoman. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_23"><sup>23</sup>But he <i>who</i> <i>was</i> of the bondwoman <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 9:7, 8; Gal. 4:29">⚓</a>was born according to the flesh, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 16:15; 17:15–19; 18:10; 21:1; Gal. 4:28; Heb. 11:11">⚓</a>and he of the freewoman through promise, </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_24"><sup>24</sup>which things are symbolic. For these are the two covenants: the one from Mount <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:6–8; Deut. 33:2">⚓</a>Sinai which gives birth to bondage, which is Hagar— </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_25"><sup>25</sup>for this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children— </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_26"><sup>26</sup>but the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 2:2)">⚓</a>Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_27"><sup>27</sup>For it is written:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 54:1">⚓</a>“Rejoice, O barren,<br/>   <i>You</i> who do not bear!<br/>   Break forth and shout,<br/>   You who are not in labor!<br/>   For the desolate has many more children<br/>   Than she who has a husband.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse ga_4_28"> <sup>28</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 9:7, 8; Gal. 3:29">⚓</a>we, brethren, as Isaac <i>was,</i> are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 3:25">⚓</a>children of promise. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_29"><sup>29</sup>But, as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:9">⚓</a>he who was born according to the flesh then persecuted him <i>who</i> <i>was</i> <i>born</i> according to the Spirit, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 5:11">⚓</a>even so <i>it</i> <i>is</i> now. </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_30"><sup>30</sup>Nevertheless what does <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gal. 3:8, 22)">⚓</a>the Scripture say? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 21:10, 12">⚓</a>“Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 8:35)">⚓</a>the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.” </span>
<span class="verse ga_4_31"><sup>31</sup>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free.<br/></span>
