<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>Greeting</h3></div>
<span class="verse phi_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ,<br/> To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Tim. 3:8–13)">⚓</a>deacons:<br/></span>
<span class="verse phi_1_2"> <sup>2</sup>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Thankfulness and Prayer</h3></div>
<span class="verse phi_1_3"> <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:4">⚓</a>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_4"><sup>4</sup>always in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 1:16; 1 Thess. 1:2">⚓</a>every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy, </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 12:13)">⚓</a>for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now, </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_6"><sup>6</sup>being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 6:29)">⚓</a>a good work in you will complete <i>it</i> until the day of Jesus Christ; </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_7"><sup>7</sup>just as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers with me of grace. </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_8"><sup>8</sup>For God is my witness, how greatly I long for you all with the affection of Jesus Christ.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phi_1_9"> <sup>9</sup>And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment, </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_10"><sup>10</sup>that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ, </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_11"><sup>11</sup>being filled with the fruits of righteousness <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 2:10); Col. 1:6">⚓</a>which <i>are</i> by Jesus Christ, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 15:8">⚓</a>to the glory and praise of God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Christ Is Preached</h3></div>
<span class="verse phi_1_12"> <sup>12</sup>But I want you to know, brethren, that the things <i>which</i> <i>happened</i> to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel, </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_13"><sup>13</sup>so that it has become evident <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 4:22">⚓</a>to the whole palace guard, and to all the rest, that my chains are in Christ; </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_14"><sup>14</sup>and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phi_1_15"> <sup>15</sup>Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from goodwill: </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_16"><sup>16</sup>The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains; </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_17"><sup>17</sup>but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_18"><sup>18</sup>What then? Only <i>that</i> in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>To Live Is Christ</h3></div>
<span class="verse phi_1_19"> <sup>19</sup>For I know that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 13:16, LXX">⚓</a>this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_20"><sup>20</sup>according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 6:19, 20">⚓</a>with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 14:8)">⚓</a>or by death. </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_21"><sup>21</sup>For to me, to live <i>is</i> Christ, and to die <i>is</i> gain. </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_22"><sup>22</sup>But if <i>I</i> live on in the flesh, this <i>will</i> <i>mean</i> fruit from <i>my</i> labor; yet what I shall choose I cannot tell. </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_23"><sup>23</sup>For I am hard-pressed between the two, having a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 5:2, 8); 2 Tim. 4:6">⚓</a>desire to depart and be with Christ, <i>which</i> <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 16:11)">⚓</a>far better. </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_24"><sup>24</sup>Nevertheless to remain in the flesh <i>is</i> more needful for you. </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_25"><sup>25</sup>And being confident of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of faith, </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_26"><sup>26</sup>that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 1:14">⚓</a>your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Striving and Suffering for Christ</h3></div>
<span class="verse phi_1_27"> <sup>27</sup>Only <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 4:1; 1 Thess. 2:12">⚓</a>let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:10; Eph. 4:3">⚓</a>with one mind <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jude 3">⚓</a>striving together for the faith of the gospel, </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_28"><sup>28</sup>and not in any way terrified by your adversaries, which is to them a proof of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that from God. </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_29"><sup>29</sup>For to you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 5:11, 12; Acts 5:41; Rom. 5:3)">⚓</a>it has been granted on behalf of Christ, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 2:8">⚓</a>not only to believe in Him, but also to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Tim. 3:12)">⚓</a>suffer for His sake, </span>
<span class="verse phi_1_30"><sup>30</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 1:29; 2:1; 1 Thess. 2:2; 1 Tim. 6:12; 2 Tim. 4:7; Heb. 10:32; 12:1">⚓</a>having the same conflict <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 16:19–40; Phil. 1:13; 1 Thess. 2:2">⚓</a>which you saw in me and now hear <i>is</i> in me.<br/></span>
