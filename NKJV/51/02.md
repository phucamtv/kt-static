<span class="verse co_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>For I want you to know what a great <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 1:30; Col. 1:29; 4:12; 1 Thess. 2:2">⚓</a>conflict I have for you and those in Laodicea, and <i>for</i> as many as have not seen my face in the flesh, </span>
<span class="verse co_2_2"><sup>2</sup>that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and <i>attaining</i> to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ, </span>
<span class="verse co_2_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:24, 30">⚓</a>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.<br/></span>
<span class="verse co_2_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now this I say <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 16:18; 2 Cor. 11:13; Eph. 4:14; 5:6">⚓</a>lest anyone should deceive you with persuasive words. </span>
<span class="verse co_2_5"><sup>5</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 2:17">⚓</a>though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 14:40">⚓</a>your <i>good</i> order and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Pet. 5:9">⚓</a>steadfastness of your faith in Christ.<br/></span>
<span class="verse co_2_6"> <sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 4:1">⚓</a>As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, </span>
<span class="verse co_2_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 2:21">⚓</a>rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.<br/></span>
<span class="verse co_2_8"> <sup>8</sup>Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 1:14">⚓</a>the tradition of men, according to the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 4:3, 9, 10; Col. 2:20">⚓</a>basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ. </span>
<span class="verse co_2_9"><sup>9</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:14); Col. 1:19">⚓</a>in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; </span>
<span class="verse co_2_10"><sup>10</sup>and you are complete in Him, who is the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 1:20, 21; 1 Pet. 3:22)">⚓</a>head of all principality and power.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Not Legalism but Christ</h3></div>
<span class="verse co_2_11"> <sup>11</sup>In Him you were also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 10:16">⚓</a>circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 6:6; 7:24; Gal. 5:24; Col. 3:5">⚓</a>putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, </span>
<span class="verse co_2_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 6:4">⚓</a>buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with <i>Him</i> through <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 1:19, 20">⚓</a>faith in the working of God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:24">⚓</a>who raised Him from the dead. </span>
<span class="verse co_2_13"><sup>13</sup>And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses, </span>
<span class="verse co_2_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 2:15, 16); Col. 2:20">⚓</a>having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. </span>
<span class="verse co_2_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 53:12; Heb. 2:14)">⚓</a>Having disarmed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 6:12">⚓</a>principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse co_2_16"> <sup>16</sup>So let no one <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 14:3">⚓</a>judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, </span>
<span class="verse co_2_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 8:5; 10:1">⚓</a>which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ. </span>
<span class="verse co_2_18"><sup>18</sup>Let no one cheat you of your reward, taking delight in <i>false</i> humility and worship of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, </span>
<span class="verse co_2_19"><sup>19</sup>and not holding fast to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 4:15">⚓</a>the Head, from whom all the body, nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 1:23; 4:16">⚓</a>grows with the increase <i>that</i> <i>is</i> from God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse co_2_20"> <sup>20</sup>Therefore, if you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 6:2–5">⚓</a>died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 4:3, 9">⚓</a>why, as <i>though</i> living in the world, do you subject yourselves to regulations—</span>
<span class="verse co_2_21"><sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 4:3">⚓</a>“Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle,” </span>
<span class="verse co_2_22"><sup>22</sup>which all concern things which perish with the using—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 29:13; Matt. 15:9; Titus 1:14">⚓</a>according to the commandments and doctrines of men? </span>
<span class="verse co_2_23"><sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 13:14; 1 Tim. 4:8">⚓</a>These things indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed religion, <i>false</i> humility, and neglect of the body, <i>but</i> <i>are</i> of no value against the indulgence of the flesh.<br/></span>
