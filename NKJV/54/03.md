<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>Qualifications of Overseers</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>This <i>is</i> a faithful saying: If a man desires the position of a bishop, he desires a good work. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_2"><sup>2</sup>A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach; </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_3"><sup>3</sup>not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous; </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_4"><sup>4</sup>one who rules his own house well, having <i>his</i> children in submission with all reverence </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_5"><sup>5</sup>(for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?); </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_6"><sup>6</sup>not a novice, lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the <i>same</i> condemnation as the devil. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_7"><sup>7</sup>Moreover he must have a good testimony among those who are outside, lest he fall into reproach and the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 6:9; 2 Tim. 2:26">⚓</a>snare of the devil.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Qualifications of Deacons</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_8"> <sup>8</sup>Likewise deacons <i>must</i> <i>be</i> reverent, not double-tongued, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 44:21">⚓</a>not given to much wine, not greedy for money, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_9"><sup>9</sup>holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_10"><sup>10</sup>But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being <i>found</i> blameless. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_11"><sup>11</sup>Likewise, <i>their</i> wives <i>must</i> <i>be</i> reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_12"><sup>12</sup>Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling <i>their</i> children and their own houses well. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_13"><sup>13</sup>For those who have served well as deacons <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 25:21">⚓</a>obtain for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Great Mystery</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_14"> <sup>14</sup>These things I write to you, though I hope to come to you shortly; </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_15"><sup>15</sup>but if I am delayed, <i>I</i> <i>write</i> so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_3_16"><sup>16</sup>And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:14; 1 Pet. 1:20; 1 John 1:2; 3:5, 8)">⚓</a>God was manifested in the flesh,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 3:16; Rom. 1:4)">⚓</a>Justified in the Spirit,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:2">⚓</a>Seen by angels,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 10:34; Rom. 10:18">⚓</a>Preached among the Gentiles,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 16:26; 2 Cor. 1:19; Col. 1:6, 23">⚓</a>Believed on in the world,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:51">⚓</a>Received up in glory.<br/></span>
