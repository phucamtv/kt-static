<span class="verse 1ti_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 3:13; Rev. 16:14">⚓</a>to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 7:15">⚓</a>speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 4:19">⚓</a>seared with a hot iron, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_3"><sup>3</sup>forbidding to marry, <i>and</i> <i>commanding</i> to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_4"><sup>4</sup>For every creature of God <i>is</i> good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving; </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_5"><sup>5</sup>for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Good Servant of Jesus Christ</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_6"> <sup>6</sup>If you instruct the brethren in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 3:14">⚓</a>nourished in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have carefully followed. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_7"><sup>7</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 2:16; Titus 1:14">⚓</a>reject profane and old wives’ fables, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 5:14">⚓</a>exercise yourself toward godliness. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_8"><sup>8</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 8:8">⚓</a>bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 37:9">⚓</a>having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_9"><sup>9</sup>This <i>is</i> a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_10"><sup>10</sup>For to this <i>end</i> we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 36:6">⚓</a>who is <i>the</i> Savior of all men, especially of those who believe. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_11"><sup>11</sup>These things command and teach.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Take Heed to Your Ministry</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_12"> <sup>12</sup>Let no one despise your youth, but be an <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 3:17; Titus 2:7; 1 Pet. 5:3">⚓</a>example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_13"><sup>13</sup>Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 1:6">⚓</a>Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:6; 1 Tim. 5:22">⚓</a>with the laying on of the hands of the eldership. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_15"><sup>15</sup>Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_4_16"><sup>16</sup>Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.<br/></span>
