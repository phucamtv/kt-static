<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Treatment of Church Members</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort <i>him</i> as a father, younger men as brothers, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_2"><sup>2</sup>older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, with all purity.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Honor True Widows</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_3"> <sup>3</sup>Honor widows who are really widows. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_4"><sup>4</sup>But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety at home and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 45:10">⚓</a>to repay their parents; for this is good and acceptable before God. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_5"><sup>5</sup>Now she who is really a widow, and left alone, trusts in God and continues in supplications and prayers <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 26:7">⚓</a>night and day. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_6"><sup>6</sup>But she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_7"><sup>7</sup>And these things command, that they may be blameless. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_8"><sup>8</sup>But if anyone does not provide for his own, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 58:7; 2 Cor. 12:14">⚓</a>and especially for those of his household, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 3:5">⚓</a>he has denied the faith <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:17">⚓</a>and is worse than an unbeliever.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_9"> <sup>9</sup>Do not let a widow under sixty years old be taken into the number, <i>and</i> <i>not</i> <i>unless</i> she has been the wife of one man, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_10"><sup>10</sup>well reported for good works: if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints’ feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_11"> <sup>11</sup>But refuse <i>the</i> younger widows; for when they have begun to grow wanton against Christ, they desire to marry, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_12"><sup>12</sup>having condemnation because they have cast off their first faith. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_13"><sup>13</sup>And besides they learn <i>to</i> <i>be</i> idle, wandering about from house to house, and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_14"><sup>14</sup>Therefore I desire that <i>the</i> younger <i>widows</i> marry, bear children, manage the house, give no opportunity to the adversary to speak reproachfully. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_15"><sup>15</sup>For some have already turned aside after Satan. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_16"><sup>16</sup>If any believing man or woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are really widows.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Honor the Elders</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_17"> <sup>17</sup>Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_18"><sup>18</sup>For the Scripture says, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 25:4; 1 Cor. 9:7–9">⚓</a>“You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain,” and, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:13; Deut. 24:15; Matt. 10:10; Luke 10:7; 1 Cor. 9:14">⚓</a>“The laborer <i>is</i> worthy of his wages.” </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_19"><sup>19</sup>Do not receive an accusation against an elder except <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 17:6; 19:15; Matt. 18:16">⚓</a>from two or three witnesses. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_20"><sup>20</sup>Those who are sinning rebuke in the presence of all, that the rest also may fear.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_21"> <sup>21</sup>I charge <i>you</i> before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that you observe these things without <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 1:17">⚓</a>prejudice, doing nothing with partiality. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_22"><sup>22</sup>Do not lay hands on anyone hastily, nor <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 5:6, 7; 2 John 11">⚓</a>share in other people’s sins; keep yourself pure.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_23"> <sup>23</sup>No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your frequent infirmities.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_24"> <sup>24</sup>Some men’s sins are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 5:19–21">⚓</a>clearly evident, preceding <i>them</i> to judgment, but those of some <i>men</i> follow later. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_5_25"><sup>25</sup>Likewise, the good works <i>of</i> <i>some</i> are clearly evident, and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.<br/></span>
