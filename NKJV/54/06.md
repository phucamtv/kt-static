<div class="title"><h1>6</h1><h3>Honor Masters</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_1"> <sup>1</sup>Let as many <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 6:5; Titus 2:9; 1 Pet. 2:18">⚓</a>bondservants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and <i>His</i> doctrine may not be blasphemed. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_2"><sup>2</sup>And those who have believing masters, let them not despise <i>them</i> because they are brethren, but rather serve <i>them</i> because those who are benefited are believers and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Error and Greed</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_3"> <sup>3</sup>If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 1:13">⚓</a>wholesome words, <i>even</i> the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Titus 1:1">⚓</a>and to the doctrine which accords with godliness, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_4"><sup>4</sup>he is proud, knowing nothing, but is obsessed with disputes and arguments over words, from which come envy, strife, reviling, evil suspicions, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_5"><sup>5</sup>useless wranglings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a <i>means</i> <i>of</i> gain. From <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 3:5">⚓</a>such withdraw yourself.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now godliness with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 4:11; Heb. 13:5">⚓</a>contentment is great gain. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_7"><sup>7</sup>For we brought nothing into <i>this</i> world, and it is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:21; Ps. 49:17; Eccl. 5:15">⚓</a>certain we can carry nothing out. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_8"><sup>8</sup>And having food and clothing, with these we shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 30:8, 9">⚓</a>content. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_9"><sup>9</sup>But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and <i>into</i> many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_10"><sup>10</sup>For the love of money is a root of all <i>kinds</i> <i>of</i> evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Good Confession</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_11"> <sup>11</sup>But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_12"><sup>12</sup>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_13"><sup>13</sup>I urge you in the sight of God who gives life to all things, and <i>before</i> Christ Jesus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 27:2; John 18:36, 37">⚓</a>who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_14"><sup>14</sup>that you keep <i>this</i> commandment without spot, blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ’s appearing, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_15"><sup>15</sup>which He will manifest in His own time, <i>He</i> <i>who</i> <i>is</i> the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_16"><sup>16</sup>who alone has immortality, dwelling in <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:22">⚓</a>unapproachable light, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 6:46">⚓</a>whom no man has seen or can see, to whom <i>be</i> honor and everlasting power. Amen.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Instructions to the Rich</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_17"> <sup>17</sup>Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 9:23; 48:7">⚓</a>riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 5:18, 19">⚓</a>to enjoy. </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_18"><sup>18</sup><i>Let</i> <i>them</i> do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share, </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_19"><sup>19</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 6:20, 21; 19:21)">⚓</a>storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Guard the Faith</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_20"> <sup>20</sup>O Timothy! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Tim. 1:12, 14)">⚓</a>Guard what was committed to your trust, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Titus 1:14">⚓</a>avoiding the profane <i>and</i> idle babblings and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge— </span>
<span class="verse 1ti_6_21"><sup>21</sup>by professing it some have strayed concerning the faith.<br/> Grace <i>be</i> with you. Amen.<br/></span>
