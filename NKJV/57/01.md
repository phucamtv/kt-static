<span class="verse phil_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>Paul, a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 3:1">⚓</a>prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy <i>our</i> brother,<br/> To Philemon our beloved <i>friend</i> and fellow laborer, </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_2"><sup>2</sup>to the beloved Apphia, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 4:17">⚓</a>Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:<br/></span>
<span class="verse phil_1_3"> <sup>3</sup>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Philemon’s Love and Faith</h3></div>
<span class="verse phil_1_4"> <sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 1:16; 1 Thess. 1:2; 2 Thess. 1:3">⚓</a>I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers, </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 1:15; Col. 1:4; 1 Thess. 3:6">⚓</a>hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints, </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_6"><sup>6</sup>that the sharing of your faith may become effective <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 1:9; (Col. 1:9; 3:10; James 2:14–17)">⚓</a>by the acknowledgment of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Thess. 5:18)">⚓</a>every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_7"><sup>7</sup>For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Plea for Onesimus</h3></div>
<span class="verse phil_1_8"> <sup>8</sup>Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you what is fitting, </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_9"><sup>9</sup><i>yet</i> for love’s sake I rather appeal <i>to</i> <i>you</i>—being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ— </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_10"><sup>10</sup>I appeal to you for my son <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 4:9">⚓</a>Onesimus, whom I have begotten <i>while</i> in my chains, </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_11"><sup>11</sup>who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable to you and to me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phil_1_12"> <sup>12</sup>I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_13"><sup>13</sup>whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my chains for the gospel. </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_14"><sup>14</sup>But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 9:7; 1 Pet. 5:2">⚓</a>that your good deed might not be by compulsion, as it were, but voluntary.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phil_1_15"> <sup>15</sup>For perhaps he departed for a while for this <i>purpose,</i> that you might receive him forever, </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_16"><sup>16</sup>no longer as a slave but more than a slave—a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 6:5; Col. 3:22">⚓</a>flesh and in the Lord.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Philemon’s Obedience Encouraged</h3></div>
<span class="verse phil_1_17"> <sup>17</sup>If then you count me as a partner, receive him as <i>you</i> <i>would</i> me. </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_18"><sup>18</sup>But if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account. </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_19"><sup>19</sup>I, Paul, am writing with my own <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 16:21; Gal. 6:11; 2 Thess. 3:17">⚓</a>hand. I will repay—not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self besides. </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_20"><sup>20</sup>Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phil_1_21"> <sup>21</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 7:16">⚓</a>Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_22"><sup>22</sup>But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 1:25; 2:24">⚓</a>I trust that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 1:11">⚓</a>through your prayers I shall be granted to you.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Farewell</h3></div>
<span class="verse phil_1_23"> <sup>23</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 1:7; 4:12">⚓</a>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, </span>
<span class="verse phil_1_24"><sup>24</sup><i>as</i> <i>do</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 12:12, 25; 15:37–39; Col. 4:10">⚓</a>Mark, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 19:29; 27:2; Col. 4:10">⚓</a>Aristarchus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 4:14; 2 Tim. 4:10">⚓</a>Demas, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 4:11">⚓</a>Luke, my fellow laborers.<br/></span>
<span class="verse phil_1_25"> <sup>25</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Tim. 4:22">⚓</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with your spirit. Amen.<br/></span>
