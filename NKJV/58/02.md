<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Do Not Neglect Salvation</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>Therefore we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_2"><sup>2</sup>For if the word <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 33:2; Acts 7:53; Gal. 3:19">⚓</a>spoken through angels proved steadfast, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 15:30">⚓</a>every transgression and disobedience received a just reward, </span>
<span class="verse he_2_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 10:28">⚓</a>how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 4:17">⚓</a>which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:20; Luke 1:2; 1 John 1:1">⚓</a>confirmed to us by those who heard <i>Him,</i></span>
<span class="verse he_2_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 16:20">⚓</a>God also bearing witness <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:22, 43; 2 Cor. 12:2">⚓</a>both with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 12:4, 7, 11; Eph. 4:7">⚓</a>gifts of the Holy Spirit, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 1:5, 9">⚓</a>according to His own will?<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Son Made Lower than Angels</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>For He has not put <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Pet. 3:13)">⚓</a>the world to come, of which we speak, in subjection to angels. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_6"><sup>6</sup>But one testified in a certain place, saying:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 7:17; Ps. 8:4–6">⚓</a>“What is man that You are mindful of him,<br/>   Or the son of man that You take care of him?<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_2_7">   <sup>7</sup>You have made him a little lower than the angels;<br/>   You have crowned him with glory and honor,<br/>   And set him over the works of Your hands.<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_2_8">   <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:18">⚓</a>You have put all things in subjection under his feet.”<br/> For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left nothing <i>that</i> <i>is</i> not put under him. But now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 8:6; 1 Cor. 15:25, 27">⚓</a>we do not yet see all things put under him. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_9"><sup>9</sup>But we see Jesus, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 2:7–9; Heb. 1:9">⚓</a>who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 2:33; 3:13; 1 Pet. 1:21">⚓</a>crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:12; (John 3:16)">⚓</a>for everyone.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Bringing Many Sons to Glory</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_2_10"> <sup>10</sup>For it was fitting for Him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 1:16">⚓</a>for whom <i>are</i> all things and by whom <i>are</i> all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 5:8, 9; 7:28">⚓</a>perfect through sufferings. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_11"><sup>11</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 10:10">⚓</a>both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 17:26">⚓</a><i>are</i> all of one, for which reason <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 28:10">⚓</a>He is not ashamed to call them brethren, </span>
<span class="verse he_2_12"><sup>12</sup>saying:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:22">⚓</a>“I will declare Your name to My brethren;<br/>   In the midst of the assembly I will sing praise to You.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_2_13"> <sup>13</sup>And again:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 22:3; Is. 8:17">⚓</a>“I will put My trust in Him.”<br/> And again:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 8:18">⚓</a>“Here am I and the children whom God has given Me.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_2_14"> <sup>14</sup>Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:14">⚓</a>Himself likewise shared in the same, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 2:15">⚓</a>that through death He might destroy him who had the power of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 15:54–57); 2 Tim. 1:10">⚓</a>death, that is, the devil, </span>
<span class="verse he_2_15"><sup>15</sup>and release those who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 68:18; Is. 42:7; 45:13; 49:9; 61:1; (Luke 1:74)">⚓</a>through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_16"><sup>16</sup>For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_17"><sup>17</sup>Therefore, in all things He had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 2:7; Heb. 2:14">⚓</a>to be made like <i>His</i> brethren, that He might be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 4:15; 5:1–10)">⚓</a>a merciful and faithful High Priest in things <i>pertaining</i> to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. </span>
<span class="verse he_2_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 4:15, 16)">⚓</a>For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted.<br/></span>
