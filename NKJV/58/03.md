<div class="title"><h1>3</h1><h3>The Son Was Faithful</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class="verse he_3_2"><sup>2</sup>who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 40:16; Num. 12:7; Heb. 3:5">⚓</a>Moses also <i>was</i> <i>faithful</i> in all His house. </span>
<span class="verse he_3_3"><sup>3</sup>For this One has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 6:12, 13">⚓</a>He who built the house has more honor than the house. </span>
<span class="verse he_3_4"><sup>4</sup>For every house is built by someone, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 2:10)">⚓</a>He who built all things <i>is</i> God. </span>
<span class="verse he_3_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 40:16; Num. 12:7; Heb. 3:2">⚓</a>And Moses indeed <i>was</i> faithful in all His house as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 14:31; Num. 12:7">⚓</a>a servant, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 18:15, 18, 19">⚓</a>for a testimony of those things which would be spoken <i>afterward,</i></span>
<span class="verse he_3_6"><sup>6</sup>but Christ as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:7; 110:4; Heb. 1:2">⚓</a>a Son over His own house, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 3:16); 1 Tim. 3:15">⚓</a>whose house we are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 10:22)">⚓</a>if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Be Faithful</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_3_7"> <sup>7</sup>Therefore, as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:16">⚓</a>the Holy Spirit says:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 95:7–11; Heb. 3:15; 4:7">⚓</a>“Today, if you will hear His voice,<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_3_8">   <sup>8</sup>Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,<br/>   In the day of trial in the wilderness,<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_3_9">   <sup>9</sup>Where your fathers tested Me, tried Me,<br/>   And saw My works forty years.<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_3_10">   <sup>10</sup>Therefore I was angry with that generation,<br/>   And said, ‘They always go astray in <i>their</i> heart,<br/>   And they have not known My ways.’<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_3_11">   <sup>11</sup>So I swore in My wrath,<br/>   ‘They shall not enter My rest.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_3_12"> <sup>12</sup>Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; </span>
<span class="verse he_3_13"><sup>13</sup>but exhort one another daily, while it is called “Today,” lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. </span>
<span class="verse he_3_14"><sup>14</sup>For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end, </span>
<span class="verse he_3_15"><sup>15</sup>while it is said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 95:7, 8">⚓</a>“Today, if you will hear His voice,<br/>   Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Failure of the Wilderness Wanderers</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_3_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:2, 11, 30; Deut. 1:35, 36, 38">⚓</a>For who, having heard, rebelled? Indeed, <i>was</i> <i>it</i> not all who came out of Egypt, <i>led</i> by Moses? </span>
<span class="verse he_3_17"><sup>17</sup>Now with whom was He angry forty years? <i>Was</i> <i>it</i> not with those who sinned, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:22, 23">⚓</a>whose corpses fell in the wilderness? </span>
<span class="verse he_3_18"><sup>18</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:30">⚓</a>to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who did not obey? </span>
<span class="verse he_3_19"><sup>19</sup>So we see that they could not enter in because of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 14:1–39; 1 Cor. 10:11, 12">⚓</a>unbelief.<br/></span>
