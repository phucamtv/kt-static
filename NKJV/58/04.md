<div class="title"><h1>4</h1><h3>The Promise of Rest</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_4_1"> <sup>1</sup>Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 6:1; (Gal. 5:4); Heb. 12:15">⚓</a>let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it. </span>
<span class="verse he_4_2"><sup>2</sup>For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard <i>it.</i></span>
<span class="verse he_4_3"><sup>3</sup>For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 95:11; Heb. 3:11">⚓</a>“So I swore in My wrath,<br/>   ‘They shall not enter My rest,’ ”<br/> although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. </span>
<span class="verse he_4_4"><sup>4</sup>For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh <i>day</i> in this way: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 2:2; Ex. 20:11; 31:17">⚓</a>“And God rested on the seventh day from all His works”; </span>
<span class="verse he_4_5"><sup>5</sup>and again in this <i>place:</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 95:11">⚓</a>“They shall not enter My rest.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_4_6"> <sup>6</sup>Since therefore it remains that some <i>must</i> enter it, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of disobedience, </span>
<span class="verse he_4_7"><sup>7</sup>again He designates a certain day, saying in David, “Today,” after such a long time, as it has been said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 95:7, 8">⚓</a>“Today, if you will hear His voice,<br/>   Do not harden your hearts.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_4_8"> <sup>8</sup>For if Joshua had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Josh. 22:4">⚓</a>given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day. </span>
<span class="verse he_4_9"><sup>9</sup>There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. </span>
<span class="verse he_4_10"><sup>10</sup>For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God <i>did</i> from His.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Word Discovers Our Condition</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_4_11"> <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 1:10">⚓</a>Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience. </span>
<span class="verse he_4_12"><sup>12</sup>For the word of God <i>is</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 147:15">⚓</a>living and powerful, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 49:2">⚓</a>sharper than any <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 6:17; Rev. 2:12">⚓</a>two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 12:48); 1 Cor. 14:24, 25">⚓</a>a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. </span>
<span class="verse he_4_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 16:9; Ps. 33:13–15; 90:8">⚓</a>And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things <i>are</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 26:6; Prov. 15:11">⚓</a>naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we <i>must</i> <i>give</i> account.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Our Compassionate High Priest</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_4_14"> <sup>14</sup>Seeing then that we have a great <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 2:17; 7:26">⚓</a>High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 10:23">⚓</a>let us hold fast <i>our</i> confession. </span>
<span class="verse he_4_15"><sup>15</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:3–5">⚓</a>we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 22:28">⚓</a>was in all <i>points</i> tempted as <i>we</i> <i>are, </i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 7:26">⚓</a>yet without sin. </span>
<span class="verse he_4_16"><sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 2:18; Heb. 10:19, 22)">⚓</a>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.<br/></span>
