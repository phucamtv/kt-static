<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>Qualifications for High Priesthood</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>For every high priest taken from among men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 2:17; 8:3">⚓</a>is appointed for men in things <i>pertaining</i> to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. </span>
<span class="verse he_5_2"><sup>2</sup>He can have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is also subject to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 7:28">⚓</a>weakness. </span>
<span class="verse he_5_3"><sup>3</sup>Because of this he is required as for the people, so also for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 9:7; 16:6; (Heb. 7:27; 9:7)">⚓</a>himself, to offer <i>sacrifices</i> for sins. </span>
<span class="verse he_5_4"><sup>4</sup>And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called by God, just as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 28:1; Num. 16:40; 1 Chr. 23:13">⚓</a>Aaron <i>was.</i><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Priest Forever</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_5_5"> <sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:54">⚓</a>So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but <i>it</i> <i>was</i> He who said to Him:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:7">⚓</a>“You are My Son,<br/>   Today I have begotten You.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_5_6"> <sup>6</sup>As <i>He</i> also <i>says</i> in another <i>place:</i><br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 110:4; Heb. 7:17">⚓</a>“You <i>are</i> a priest forever<br/>   According to the order of Melchizedek”;<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_5_7"> <sup>7</sup>who, in the days of His flesh, when He had <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:39, 42, 44; Mark 14:36, 39; Luke 22:41, 44">⚓</a>offered up prayers and supplications, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 22:1">⚓</a>with vehement cries and tears to Him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:53">⚓</a>who was able to save Him from death, and was heard <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:39">⚓</a>because of His godly fear, </span>
<span class="verse he_5_8"><sup>8</sup>though He was a Son, <i>yet</i> He learned <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 2:8">⚓</a>obedience by the things which He suffered. </span>
<span class="verse he_5_9"><sup>9</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 2:10">⚓</a>having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him, </span>
<span class="verse he_5_10"><sup>10</sup>called by God as High Priest <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 110:4">⚓</a>“according to the order of Melchizedek,” </span>
<span class="verse he_5_11"><sup>11</sup>of whom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 16:12); Heb. 7:1–22">⚓</a>we have much to say, and hard to explain, since you have become <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 13:15)">⚓</a>dull of hearing.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Spiritual Immaturity</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_5_12"> <sup>12</sup>For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need <i>someone</i> to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 3:1–3; 1 Pet. 2:2">⚓</a>milk and not solid food. </span>
<span class="verse he_5_13"><sup>13</sup>For everyone who partakes <i>only</i> of milk <i>is</i> unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 4:14">⚓</a>a babe. </span>
<span class="verse he_5_14"><sup>14</sup>But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, <i>that</i> <i>is,</i> those who by reason of use have their senses exercised <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 7:15; Phil. 1:9">⚓</a>to discern both good and evil.<br/></span>
