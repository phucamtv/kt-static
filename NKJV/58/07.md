<div class="title"><h1>7</h1><h3>The King of Righteousness</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_7_1"> <sup>1</sup>For this <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:18–20; Heb. 7:6">⚓</a>Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, </span>
<span class="verse he_7_2"><sup>2</sup>to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being translated “king of righteousness,” and then also king of Salem, meaning “king of peace,” </span>
<span class="verse he_7_3"><sup>3</sup>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_7_4"> <sup>4</sup>Now consider how great this man <i>was,</i> to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils. </span>
<span class="verse he_7_5"><sup>5</sup>And indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 18:21–26; 2 Chr. 31:4">⚓</a>those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to receive tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, though they have come from the loins of Abraham; </span>
<span class="verse he_7_6"><sup>6</sup>but he whose genealogy is not derived from them received tithes from Abraham <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 14:19, 20">⚓</a>and blessed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 4:13)">⚓</a>him who had the promises. </span>
<span class="verse he_7_7"><sup>7</sup>Now beyond all contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better. </span>
<span class="verse he_7_8"><sup>8</sup>Here mortal men receive tithes, but there he <i>receives</i> <i>them,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 5:6; 6:20; (Rev. 1:18)">⚓</a>of whom it is witnessed that he lives. </span>
<span class="verse he_7_9"><sup>9</sup>Even Levi, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham, so to speak, </span>
<span class="verse he_7_10"><sup>10</sup>for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Need for a New Priesthood</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_7_11"> <sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 7:7–14); Gal. 2:21; Heb. 7:18; 8:7">⚓</a>Therefore, if perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need <i>was</i> <i>there</i> that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be called according to the order of Aaron? </span>
<span class="verse he_7_12"><sup>12</sup>For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is also a change of the law. </span>
<span class="verse he_7_13"><sup>13</sup>For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man has officiated at the altar.<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_7_14"> <sup>14</sup>For <i>it</i> <i>is</i> evident that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:8–10; Num. 24:17; Is. 1:1; Mic. 5:2; Matt. 1:3; 2:6; Rev. 5:5">⚓</a>our Lord arose from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 1:2">⚓</a>Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood. </span>
<span class="verse he_7_15"><sup>15</sup>And it is yet far more evident if, in the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest </span>
<span class="verse he_7_16"><sup>16</sup>who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life. </span>
<span class="verse he_7_17"><sup>17</sup>For He testifies:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 110:4; Heb. 5:6; 6:20; 7:21">⚓</a>“You <i>are</i> a priest forever<br/>   According to the order of Melchizedek.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_7_18"> <sup>18</sup>For on the one hand there is an annulling of the former commandment because of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 8:3); Gal. 3:21; Heb. 7:11">⚓</a>its weakness and unprofitableness, </span>
<span class="verse he_7_19"><sup>19</sup>for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Acts 13:39); Rom. 3:20; 7:7; Gal. 2:16; 3:21; Heb. 9:9; 10:1">⚓</a>the law made nothing perfect; on the other hand, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> <i>the</i> bringing in of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 6:18, 19">⚓</a>a better hope, through which <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lam. 3:57; Rom. 5:2; (Eph. 2:18); Heb. 4:16; James 4:8">⚓</a>we draw near to God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Greatness of the New Priest</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_7_20"> <sup>20</sup>And inasmuch as <i>He</i> <i>was</i> not <i>made</i> <i>priest</i> without an oath </span>
<span class="verse he_7_21"><sup>21</sup>(for they have become priests without an oath, but He with an oath by Him who said to Him:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 110:4; Heb. 5:6; 7:17">⚓</a>“The LORD has sworn<br/>   And will not relent,<br/>   ‘You <i>are</i> a priest forever<br/>   According to the order of Melchizedek’ ”),<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_7_22"> <sup>22</sup>by so much more Jesus has become a surety of a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 8:6">⚓</a>better covenant.<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_7_23"> <sup>23</sup>Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing. </span>
<span class="verse he_7_24"><sup>24</sup>But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. </span>
<span class="verse he_7_25"><sup>25</sup>Therefore He is also <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jude 24">⚓</a>able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 8:34; 1 Tim. 2:5; Heb. 9:24; 1 John 2:1">⚓</a>to make intercession for them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_7_26"> <sup>26</sup>For such a High Priest was fitting for us, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 5:21); Heb. 4:15">⚓</a><i>who</i> <i>is</i> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 1:20">⚓</a>and has become higher than the heavens; </span>
<span class="verse he_7_27"><sup>27</sup>who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 9:7; 16:6; Heb. 5:3">⚓</a>own sins and then for the people’s, for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. </span>
<span class="verse he_7_28"><sup>28</sup>For the law appoints as high priests men who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, <i>appoints</i> the Son who has been perfected forever.<br/></span>
