<div class="title"><h1>8</h1><h3>The New Priestly Service</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <i>this</i> <i>is</i> the main point of the things we are saying: We have such a High Priest, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 68:18; 110:1; Eph. 1:20; Col. 3:1; Heb. 2:17; 3:1; 10:12">⚓</a>who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, </span>
<span class="verse he_8_2"><sup>2</sup>a Minister of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 9:8, 12">⚓</a>the sanctuary and of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 9:11, 24">⚓</a>the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man.<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_8_3"> <sup>3</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 4:25; 5:6, 8; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 5:2); Heb. 5:1; 8:4">⚓</a>every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 5:2; Heb. 9:14)">⚓</a><i>it</i> <i>is</i> necessary that this One also have something to offer. </span>
<span class="verse he_8_4"><sup>4</sup>For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law; </span>
<span class="verse he_8_5"><sup>5</sup>who serve <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 9:23, 24">⚓</a>the copy and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 2:17; Heb. 10:1">⚓</a>shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the tabernacle. For He said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:40">⚓</a>“See <i>that</i> you make all things according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.” </span>
<span class="verse he_8_6"><sup>6</sup>But now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 3:6–8)">⚓</a>He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Luke 22:20); Heb. 7:22">⚓</a>better covenant, which was established on better promises.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A New Covenant</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_8_7"> <sup>7</sup>For if that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 3:8; 19:5">⚓</a>first <i>covenant</i> had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second. </span>
<span class="verse he_8_8"><sup>8</sup>Because finding fault with them, He says: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 31:31–34">⚓</a>“Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah— </span>
<span class="verse he_8_9"><sup>9</sup>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the LORD. </span>
<span class="verse he_8_10"><sup>10</sup>For this <i>is</i> the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 31:33; Rom. 11:27; Heb. 10:16">⚓</a>Lord: I will put My laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 8:8">⚓</a>I will be their God, and they shall be My people. </span>
<span class="verse he_8_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 54:13; John 6:45; (1 John 2:27)">⚓</a>None of them shall teach his neighbor, and none his brother, saying, ‘Know the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 31:34">⚓</a>Lord,’ for all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them. </span>
<span class="verse he_8_12"><sup>12</sup>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 11:27">⚓</a>and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_8_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 5:17); Heb. 1:11">⚓</a>In that He says, “A new <i>covenant</i>,” He has made the first obsolete. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.<br/></span>
