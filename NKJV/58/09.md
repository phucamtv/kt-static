<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>The Earthly Sanctuary</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then indeed, even the first <i>covenant</i> had ordinances of divine service and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:8; (Heb. 8:2; 9:11, 24)">⚓</a>the earthly sanctuary. </span>
<span class="verse he_9_2"><sup>2</sup>For a tabernacle was prepared: the first <i>part,</i> in which <i>was</i> the lampstand, the table, and the showbread, which is called the sanctuary; </span>
<span class="verse he_9_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 26:31–35; 40:3">⚓</a>and behind the second veil, the part of the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of All, </span>
<span class="verse he_9_4"><sup>4</sup>which had the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 16:12">⚓</a>golden censer and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:10">⚓</a>the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which <i>were</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 16:33">⚓</a>the golden pot that had the manna, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 17:1–10">⚓</a>Aaron’s rod that budded, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:16; 34:29; Deut. 10:2–5">⚓</a>the tablets of the covenant; </span>
<span class="verse he_9_5"><sup>5</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 25:17, 20; Lev. 16:2; 1 Kin. 8:7">⚓</a>above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Limitations of the Earthly Service</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_9_6"> <sup>6</sup>Now when these things had been thus prepared, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 18:2–6; 28:3">⚓</a>the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle, performing the services. </span>
<span class="verse he_9_7"><sup>7</sup>But into the second part the high priest <i>went</i> alone <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:10; Lev. 16:34; Heb. 10:3">⚓</a>once a year, not without blood, which he offered for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 5:3">⚓</a>himself and <i>for</i> the people’s sins <i>committed</i> in ignorance; </span>
<span class="verse he_9_8"><sup>8</sup>the Holy Spirit indicating this, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 14:6; Heb. 10:20)">⚓</a>the way into the Holiest of All was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was still standing. </span>
<span class="verse he_9_9"><sup>9</sup>It <i>was</i> symbolic for the present time in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gal. 3:21); Heb. 7:19">⚓</a>which cannot make him who performed the service perfect in regard to the conscience— </span>
<span class="verse he_9_10"><sup>10</sup><i>concerned</i> only with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:2; Col. 2:16">⚓</a>foods and drinks, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 19:7">⚓</a>various washings, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 2:15">⚓</a>and fleshly ordinances imposed until the time of reformation.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Heavenly Sanctuary</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_9_11"> <sup>11</sup>But Christ came <i>as</i> High Priest of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 1:3–11); Heb. 10:1">⚓</a>the good things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation. </span>
<span class="verse he_9_12"><sup>12</sup>Not <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 10:4">⚓</a>with the blood of goats and calves, but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:12; Eph. 1:7">⚓</a>with His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 3:9">⚓</a>once for all, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Dan. 9:24)">⚓</a>having obtained eternal redemption. </span>
<span class="verse he_9_13"><sup>13</sup>For if <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 16:14, 15; Heb. 9:19; 10:4">⚓</a>the blood of bulls and goats and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 19:2">⚓</a>the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh, </span>
<span class="verse he_9_14"><sup>14</sup>how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 John 1:7">⚓</a>cleanse your conscience from <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 6:1">⚓</a>dead works <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 1:74">⚓</a>to serve the living God? </span>
<span class="verse he_9_15"><sup>15</sup>And for this reason <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 3:25">⚓</a>He is the Mediator of the new covenant, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 3:1">⚓</a>those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Mediator’s Death Necessary</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_9_16"> <sup>16</sup>For where there <i>is</i> a testament, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. </span>
<span class="verse he_9_17"><sup>17</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 3:15">⚓</a>a testament <i>is</i> in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the testator lives. </span>
<span class="verse he_9_18"><sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:6">⚓</a>Therefore not even the first <i>covenant</i> was dedicated without blood. </span>
<span class="verse he_9_19"><sup>19</sup>For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:5, 6">⚓</a>he took the blood of calves and goats, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 14:4, 7; Num. 19:6, 18">⚓</a>with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, </span>
<span class="verse he_9_20"><sup>20</sup>saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 26:28)">⚓</a>“This <i>is</i> the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:3–8">⚓</a>blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.” </span>
<span class="verse he_9_21"><sup>21</sup>Then likewise <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 29:12, 36">⚓</a>he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry. </span>
<span class="verse he_9_22"><sup>22</sup>And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 17:11">⚓</a>without shedding of blood there is no remission.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Greatness of Christ’s Sacrifice</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_9_23"> <sup>23</sup>Therefore <i>it</i> <i>was</i> necessary that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 8:5">⚓</a>the copies of the things in the heavens should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. </span>
<span class="verse he_9_24"><sup>24</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 6:20">⚓</a>Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, <i>which</i> <i>are</i> copies of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 8:2">⚓</a>the true, but into heaven itself, now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 8:34">⚓</a>to appear in the presence of God for us; </span>
<span class="verse he_9_25"><sup>25</sup>not that He should offer Himself often, as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 9:7">⚓</a>the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood of another— </span>
<span class="verse he_9_26"><sup>26</sup>He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now, once at the end of the ages, He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. </span>
<span class="verse he_9_27"><sup>27</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:19; Eccl. 3:20">⚓</a>And as it is appointed for men to die once, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 5:10); 1 John 4:17">⚓</a>but after this the judgment, </span>
<span class="verse he_9_28"><sup>28</sup>so <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 6:10">⚓</a>Christ was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:12; 1 Pet. 2:24">⚓</a>offered once to bear the sins <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 26:28">⚓</a>of many. To those who <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 1:7; Titus 2:13">⚓</a>eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.<br/></span>
