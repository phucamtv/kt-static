<span class="verse he_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>For the law, having a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 8:5">⚓</a>shadow of the good things to come, <i>and</i> not the very image of the things, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 7:19; 9:9">⚓</a>can never with these same sacrifices, which they offer continually year by year, make those who approach perfect. </span>
<span class="verse he_10_2"><sup>2</sup>For then would they not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers, once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins. </span>
<span class="verse he_10_3"><sup>3</sup>But in those <i>sacrifices</i> <i>there</i> <i>is</i> a reminder of sins every year. </span>
<span class="verse he_10_4"><sup>4</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mic. 6:6, 7">⚓</a><i>it</i> <i>is</i> not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Christ’s Death Fulfills God’s Will</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_10_5"> <sup>5</sup>Therefore, when He came into the world, He said:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 40:6–8">⚓</a>“Sacrifice and offering You did not desire,<br/>   But a body You have prepared for Me.<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_10_6">   <sup>6</sup>In burnt offerings and <i>sacrifices</i> for sin<br/>   You had no pleasure.<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_10_7">   <sup>7</sup>Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come—<br/>   In the volume of the book it is written of Me—<br/>   To do Your will, O God.’ ”<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_10_8"> <sup>8</sup>Previously saying, “Sacrifice and offering, burnt offerings, and <i>offerings</i> for sin You did not desire, nor had pleasure <i>in</i> <i>them</i>” (which are offered according to the law), </span>
<span class="verse he_10_9"><sup>9</sup>then He said, “Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God.” He takes away the first that He may establish the second. </span>
<span class="verse he_10_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 17:19; (Eph. 5:26; Heb. 2:11; 10:14, 29; 13:12)">⚓</a>By that will we have been sanctified <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 9:12)">⚓</a>through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once <i>for</i> <i>all.</i><br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Christ’s Death Perfects the Sanctified</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_10_11"> <sup>11</sup>And every priest stands <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 28:3">⚓</a>ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. </span>
<span class="verse he_10_12"><sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 3:1; Heb. 1:3">⚓</a>But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 110:1">⚓</a>at the right hand of God, </span>
<span class="verse he_10_13"><sup>13</sup>from that time waiting <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 110:1; Heb. 1:13">⚓</a>till His enemies are made His footstool. </span>
<span class="verse he_10_14"><sup>14</sup>For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_10_15"> <sup>15</sup>But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before,<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_10_16"> <sup>16</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 31:33, 34; Heb. 8:10">⚓</a>“This <i>is</i> the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,” </span>
<span class="verse he_10_17"><sup>17</sup><i>then</i> <i>He</i> <i>adds,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 31:34">⚓</a>“Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.” </span>
<span class="verse he_10_18"><sup>18</sup>Now where there is remission of these, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no longer an offering for sin.<br/></span>
