<span class="verse he_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 3:8">⚓</a>let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares <i>us,</i> and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 9:24; Gal. 2:2; Heb. 10:39">⚓</a>let us run <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 12:12; Heb. 10:36">⚓</a>with endurance the race that is set before us, </span>
<span class="verse he_12_2"><sup>2</sup>looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of <i>our</i> faith, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:26">⚓</a>who for the joy that was set before Him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 69:7, 19; Phil. 2:8; (Heb. 2:9)">⚓</a>endured the cross, despising the shame, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 110:1">⚓</a>has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Discipline of God</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_12_3"> <sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:24">⚓</a>For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 6:9; Heb. 12:5">⚓</a>lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls. </span>
<span class="verse he_12_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 10:13)">⚓</a>You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin. </span>
<span class="verse he_12_5"><sup>5</sup>And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 5:17; Prov. 3:11, 12">⚓</a>“My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord,<br/>   Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him;<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_12_6">   <sup>6</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 94:12; Rev. 3:19">⚓</a>whom the Lord loves He chastens,<br/>   And scourges every son whom He receives.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_12_7"> <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 8:5; 2 Sam. 7:14">⚓</a>If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 13:24; 19:18; 23:13">⚓</a>son is there whom a father does not chasten? </span>
<span class="verse he_12_8"><sup>8</sup>But if you are without chastening, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Pet. 5:9">⚓</a>of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons. </span>
<span class="verse he_12_9"><sup>9</sup>Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected <i>us,</i> and we paid <i>them</i> respect. Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Job 12:10)">⚓</a>the Father of spirits and live? </span>
<span class="verse he_12_10"><sup>10</sup>For they indeed for a few days chastened <i>us</i> as seemed <i>best</i> to them, but He for <i>our</i> profit, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 11:44">⚓</a>that <i>we</i> may be partakers of His holiness. </span>
<span class="verse he_12_11"><sup>11</sup>Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 32:17; 2 Tim. 4:8; James 3:17, 18">⚓</a>the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Renew Your Spiritual Vitality</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_12_12"> <sup>12</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 35:3">⚓</a>strengthen the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, </span>
<span class="verse he_12_13"><sup>13</sup>and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_12_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 34:14">⚓</a>Pursue peace with all <i>people,</i> and holiness, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 5:8; (Heb. 9:28)">⚓</a>without which no one will see the Lord: </span>
<span class="verse he_12_15"><sup>15</sup>looking carefully lest anyone <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Cor. 6:1; Gal. 5:4; Heb. 4:1">⚓</a>fall short of the grace of God; lest any <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 29:18">⚓</a>root of bitterness springing up cause trouble, and by this many become defiled; </span>
<span class="verse he_12_16"><sup>16</sup>lest there <i>be</i> any <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 6:13–18)">⚓</a>fornicator or profane person like Esau, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 25:33">⚓</a>who for one morsel of food sold his birthright. </span>
<span class="verse he_12_17"><sup>17</sup>For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 27:30–40">⚓</a>rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Glorious Company</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_12_18"> <sup>18</sup>For you have not come to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:12, 16; 20:18; Deut. 4:11; 5:22">⚓</a>the mountain that may be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness and darkness and tempest, </span>
<span class="verse he_12_19"><sup>19</sup>and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, so that those who heard <i>it</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:18–26; Deut. 5:25; 18:16">⚓</a>begged that the word should not be spoken to them anymore. </span>
<span class="verse he_12_20"><sup>20</sup>(For they could not endure what was commanded: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:12, 13">⚓</a>“And if so much as a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned or shot with an arrow.” </span>
<span class="verse he_12_21"><sup>21</sup>And so terrifying was the sight <i>that</i> Moses said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 9:19">⚓</a>“I am exceedingly afraid and trembling.”)<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_12_22"> <sup>22</sup>But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, </span>
<span class="verse he_12_23"><sup>23</sup>to the general assembly and church of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(James 1:18)">⚓</a>the firstborn <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:20">⚓</a><i>who</i> <i>are</i> registered in heaven, to God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:25; Ps. 50:6; 94:2">⚓</a>the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Phil. 3:12)">⚓</a>made perfect, </span>
<span class="verse he_12_24"><sup>24</sup>to Jesus <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Tim. 2:5; Heb. 8:6; 9:15">⚓</a>the Mediator of the new covenant, and to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:8">⚓</a>the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:10; Heb. 11:4">⚓</a>than <i>that</i> <i>of</i> Abel.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Hear the Heavenly Voice</h3></div>
<span class="verse he_12_25"> <sup>25</sup>See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 2:2, 3">⚓</a>if they did not escape who refused Him who spoke on earth, much more <i>shall</i> <i>we</i> <i>not</i> <i>escape</i> if we turn away from Him who <i>speaks</i> from heaven, </span>
<span class="verse he_12_26"><sup>26</sup>whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Hag. 2:6">⚓</a>“Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also heaven.” </span>
<span class="verse he_12_27"><sup>27</sup>Now this, “Yet once more,” indicates the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 34:4; 54:10; 65:17; Rom. 8:19, 21); 1 Cor. 7:31; Heb. 1:10">⚓</a>removal of those things that are being shaken, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.<br/></span>
<span class="verse he_12_28"> <sup>28</sup>Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 13:15, 21">⚓</a>serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. </span>
<span class="verse he_12_29"><sup>29</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 24:17">⚓</a>our God <i>is</i> a consuming fire.<br/></span>
