<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Beware of Personal Favoritism</h3></div>
<span class="verse gia_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 7:2; 1 Cor. 2:8">⚓</a><i>the</i> <i>Lord</i> of glory, with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:15">⚓</a>partiality. </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_2"><sup>2</sup>For if there should come into your assembly a man with gold rings, in fine apparel, and there should also come in a poor man in filthy clothes, </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_3"><sup>3</sup>and you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, “You sit here in a good place,” and say to the poor man, “You stand there,” or, “Sit here at my footstool,” </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_4"><sup>4</sup>have you not shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?<br/></span>
<span class="verse gia_2_5"> <sup>5</sup>Listen, my beloved brethren: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 34:19; John 7:48; 1 Cor. 1:27">⚓</a>Has God not chosen the poor of this world <i>to</i> <i>be</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 12:21; 1 Tim. 6:18; Rev. 2:9">⚓</a>rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:6">⚓</a>which He promised to those who love Him? </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_6"><sup>6</sup>But <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 11:22">⚓</a>you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 13:50">⚓</a>and drag you into the courts? </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_7"><sup>7</sup>Do they not blaspheme that noble name by which you are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 11:26; 1 Pet. 4:16">⚓</a>called?<br/></span>
<span class="verse gia_2_8"> <sup>8</sup>If you really fulfill <i>the</i> royal law according to the Scripture, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:18">⚓</a>“You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well; </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_9"><sup>9</sup>but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:15; Deut. 1:17">⚓</a>transgressors. </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_10"><sup>10</sup>For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 3:10">⚓</a>stumble in one <i>point,</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 27:26">⚓</a>he is guilty of all. </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_11"><sup>11</sup>For He who said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:14; Deut. 5:18">⚓</a>“Do not commit adultery,” also said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 20:13; Deut. 5:17">⚓</a>“Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery, but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_12"><sup>12</sup>So speak and so do as those who will be judged by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="James 1:25">⚓</a>the law of liberty. </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_13"><sup>13</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 22:6">⚓</a>judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 21:13; Matt. 18:32–35; (Luke 6:37)">⚓</a>no <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mic. 7:18; (Matt. 5:7)">⚓</a>mercy. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 12:8">⚓</a>Mercy triumphs over judgment.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Faith Without Works Is Dead</h3></div>
<span class="verse gia_2_14"> <sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 7:21–23, 26; 21:28–32">⚓</a>What <i>does</i> <i>it</i> profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_15"><sup>15</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 25:35; Luke 3:11">⚓</a>If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_16"><sup>16</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 John 3:17, 18)">⚓</a>one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what <i>does</i> <i>it</i> profit? </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_17"><sup>17</sup>Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gia_2_18"> <sup>18</sup>But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 1:6; 1 Thess. 1:3; Heb. 6:10">⚓</a>Show me your faith without your works, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Gal. 5:6); James 3:13">⚓</a>and I will show you my faith by my works. </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_19"><sup>19</sup>You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble! </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_20"><sup>20</sup>But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_21"><sup>21</sup>Was not Abraham our father justified by works <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 22:9, 10, 12, 16–18">⚓</a>when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_22"><sup>22</sup>Do you see <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 6:29); Heb. 11:17">⚓</a>that faith was working together with his works, and by <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:39">⚓</a>works faith was made perfect? </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_23"><sup>23</sup>And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3">⚓</a>“Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” And he was called <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 20:7; Is. 41:8">⚓</a>the friend of God. </span>
<span class="verse gia_2_24"><sup>24</sup>You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gia_2_25"> <sup>25</sup>Likewise, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 11:31">⚓</a>was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent <i>them</i> out another way?<br/></span>
<span class="verse gia_2_26"> <sup>26</sup>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.<br/></span>
