<span class="verse gia_5_2"><sup>2</sup>Your <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 17:11; Matt. 6:19">⚓</a>riches are corrupted, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 13:28">⚓</a>your garments are moth-eaten. </span>
<span class="verse gia_5_3"><sup>3</sup>Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 2:5">⚓</a>You have heaped up treasure in the last days. </span>
<span class="verse gia_5_4"><sup>4</sup>Indeed <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 19:13; Job 24:10; Jer. 22:13; Mal. 3:5">⚓</a>the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 2:23; Deut. 24:15; Job 31:38">⚓</a>the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. </span>

<span class="verse gia_5_6"><sup>6</sup>You have condemned, you have murdered the just; he does not resist you.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Be Patient and Persevering</h3></div>
<span class="verse gia_5_7"> <sup>7</sup>Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See <i>how</i> the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain. </span>
<span class="verse gia_5_8"><sup>8</sup>You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.<br/></span>
<span class="verse gia_5_9"> <sup>9</sup>Do not grumble against one another, brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold, the Judge is standing at the door! </span>
<span class="verse gia_5_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 5:12">⚓</a>My brethren, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of suffering and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 10:36">⚓</a>patience. </span>

<span class="verse gia_5_12"> <sup>12</sup>But above all, my brethren, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 5:34–37">⚓</a>do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath. But let your “Yes” be “Yes,” and <i>your</i> “No,” “No,” lest you fall into judgment.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Meeting Specific Needs</h3></div>
<span class="verse gia_5_13"> <sup>13</sup>Is anyone among you suffering? Let him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 50:14, 15">⚓</a>pray. Is anyone cheerful? <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 5:19">⚓</a>Let him sing psalms. </span>
<span class="verse gia_5_14"><sup>14</sup>Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Mark 6:13; 16:18">⚓</a>anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. </span>
<span class="verse gia_5_15"><sup>15</sup>And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 33:24">⚓</a>And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. </span>
<span class="verse gia_5_16"><sup>16</sup>Confess <i>your</i> trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 11:2">⚓</a>The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. </span>
<span class="verse gia_5_17"><sup>17</sup>Elijah was a man <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 14:15">⚓</a>with a nature like ours, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 17:1; 18:1">⚓</a>he prayed earnestly that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. </span>

<div class="title"><h3>Bring Back the Erring One</h3></div>
