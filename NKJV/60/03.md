<span class="verse 1phi_3_1"> <sup>1</sup>Wives, likewise, <i>be</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:16; 1 Cor. 14:34; Eph. 5:22; Col. 3:18">⚓</a>submissive to your own husbands, that even if some do not obey the word, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 7:16">⚓</a>they, without a word, may <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 18:15">⚓</a>be won by the conduct of their wives, </span>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Pet. 2:12; 3:6">⚓</a>when they observe your chaste conduct <i>accompanied</i> by fear. </span>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_3"><sup>3</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 3:18; 1 Tim. 2:9">⚓</a>Do not let your adornment be <i>merely</i> outward—arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on <i>fine</i> apparel— </span>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_4"><sup>4</sup>rather <i>let</i> <i>it</i> <i>be</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 2:29">⚓</a>the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible <i>beauty</i> of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God. </span>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_5"><sup>5</sup>For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands, </span>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_6"><sup>6</sup>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:12">⚓</a>calling him lord, whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>A Word to Husbands</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_7"> <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 7:3; (Eph. 5:25); Col. 3:19">⚓</a>Husbands, likewise, dwell with <i>them</i> with understanding, giving honor to the wife, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 12:23">⚓</a>as to the weaker vessel, and as <i>being</i> heirs together of the grace of life, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 42:8">⚓</a>that your prayers may not be hindered.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Called to Blessing</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_8"> <sup>8</sup>Finally, all <i>of</i> <i>you</i> <i>be</i> of one mind, having compassion for one another; love as brothers, <i>be</i> tenderhearted, <i>be</i> courteous; </span>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Prov. 17:13)">⚓</a>not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 5:44">⚓</a>blessing, knowing that you were called to this, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 25:34">⚓</a>that you may inherit a blessing. </span>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_10"><sup>10</sup>For<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 34:12–16">⚓</a>“He who would love life<br/>   And see good days,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="James 1:26">⚓</a>Let him refrain his tongue from evil,<br/>   And his lips from speaking deceit.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_11">   <sup>11</sup>Let him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 37:27">⚓</a>turn away from evil and do good;<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 12:18">⚓</a>Let him seek peace and pursue it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_12">   <sup>12</sup>For the eyes of the LORD<i>are</i> on the righteous,<br/>   <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 9:31">⚓</a>And His ears <i>are</i> <i>open</i> to their prayers;<br/>   But the face of the LORD<i>is</i> against those who do evil.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Suffering for Right and Wrong</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 16:7">⚓</a>And who <i>is</i> he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good? </span>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="James 1:12">⚓</a>But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, <i>you</i> <i>are</i> blessed. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 8:12">⚓</a>“And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.” </span>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_15"><sup>15</sup>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 119:46">⚓</a><i>be</i> ready to <i>give</i> a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Titus 3:7)">⚓</a>hope that is in you, with meekness and fear; </span>

<span class="verse 1phi_3_17"><sup>17</sup>For <i>it</i> <i>is</i> better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Christ’s Suffering and Ours</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_18"> <sup>18</sup>For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit, </span>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_19"><sup>19</sup>by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison, </span>
<span class="verse 1phi_3_20"><sup>20</sup>who formerly were disobedient, when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while <i>the</i> ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water. </span>

<span class="verse 1phi_3_22"><sup>22</sup>who has gone into heaven and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 110:1">⚓</a>is at the right hand of God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 8:38; Heb. 1:6">⚓</a>angels and authorities and powers having been made subject to Him.<br/></span>
