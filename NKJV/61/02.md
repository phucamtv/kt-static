<div class="title"><h1>2</h1><h3>Destructive Doctrines</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_1"> <sup>1</sup>But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 24:5, 24; 1 Tim. 4:1, 2">⚓</a>false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, <i>and</i> bring on themselves swift destruction. </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_2"><sup>2</sup>And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed. </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_3"><sup>3</sup>By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Doom of False Teachers</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_4"> <sup>4</sup>For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast <i>them</i> down to hell and delivered <i>them</i> into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment; </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_5"><sup>5</sup>and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, <i>one</i> <i>of</i> eight <i>people</i>, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly; </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_6"><sup>6</sup>and turning the cities of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:1–26; Jude 7">⚓</a>Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned <i>them</i> to destruction, making <i>them</i> an example to those who afterward would live ungodly; </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_7"><sup>7</sup>and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:16, 29">⚓</a>delivered righteous Lot, <i>who</i> <i>was</i> oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_8"><sup>8</sup>(for that righteous man, dwelling among them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 119:139">⚓</a>tormented <i>his</i> righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing <i>their</i> lawless deeds)— </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_9"><sup>9</sup><i>then</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 34:15–19; 1 Cor. 10:13; Rev. 3:10">⚓</a>the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment, </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_10"><sup>10</sup>and especially <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jude 4, 7, 8">⚓</a>those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:28; Jude 8">⚓</a><i>They</i> <i>are</i> presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries, </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_11"><sup>11</sup>whereas <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jude 9">⚓</a>angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Depravity of False Teachers</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_12"> <sup>12</sup>But these, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jude 10">⚓</a>like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of the things they do not understand, and will utterly perish in their own corruption, </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 3:19">⚓</a><i>and</i> will receive the wages of unrighteousness, as those who count it pleasure <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 13:13">⚓</a>to carouse in the daytime. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jude 12">⚓</a><i>They</i> <i>are</i> spots and blemishes, carousing in their own deceptions while <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 11:20, 21">⚓</a>they feast with you, </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_14"><sup>14</sup>having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jude 11">⚓</a>They have a heart trained in covetous practices, <i>and</i> <i>are</i> accursed children. </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_15"><sup>15</sup>They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 22:5, 7; Deut. 23:4; Neh. 13:2; Jude 11; Rev. 2:14">⚓</a>Balaam the <i>son</i> of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_16"><sup>16</sup>but he was rebuked for his iniquity: a dumb donkey speaking with a man’s voice restrained the madness of the prophet.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_17"> <sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jude 12, 13">⚓</a>These are wells without water, clouds carried by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Deceptions of False Teachers</h3></div>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_18"> <sup>18</sup>For when they speak great swelling <i>words</i> of emptiness, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, the ones who have actually escaped from those who live in error. </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_19"><sup>19</sup>While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:34; Rom. 6:16">⚓</a>for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage. </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_20"><sup>20</sup>For if, after they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 12:45">⚓</a>have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 11:26; (Heb. 6:4–6)">⚓</a>again entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning. </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_21"><sup>21</sup>For <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 12:47">⚓</a>it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known <i>it,</i> to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them. </span>
<span class="verse 2phi_2_22"><sup>22</sup>But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 26:11">⚓</a>“A dog returns to his own vomit,” and, “a sow, having washed, to her wallowing in the mire.”<br/></span>
