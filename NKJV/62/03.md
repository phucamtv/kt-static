Therefore the world does not know us, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 15:18, 21; 16:3">⚓</a>because it did not know Him. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_3_2"><sup>2</sup>Beloved, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 56:5; Rom. 8:15, 16)">⚓</a>now we are children of God; and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 8:18, 19, 23)">⚓</a>it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 8:29; 2 Pet. 1:4">⚓</a>we shall be like Him, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Ps. 16:11)">⚓</a>we shall see Him as He is. </span>

<div class="title"><h3>Sin and the Child of God</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1gi_3_4"> <sup>4</sup>Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 4:15; 1 John 5:17">⚓</a>sin is lawlessness. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_3_5"><sup>5</sup>And you know <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 John 1:2; 3:8">⚓</a>that He was manifested <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Is. 53:5, 6); John 1:29; (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 9:26)">⚓</a>to take away our sins, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Cor. 5:21); 1 John 2:29">⚓</a>in Him there is no sin. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_3_6"><sup>6</sup>Whoever abides in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 1gi_3_7"> <sup>7</sup>Little children, let no one deceive you. He who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous. </span>

<div class="title"><h3>The Imperative of Love</h3></div>
<span class="verse 1gi_3_10"> <sup>10</sup>In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor <i>is</i> he who does not love his brother. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_3_11"><sup>11</sup>For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 13:34; 15:12); 1 John 4:7, 11, 21; 2 John 5">⚓</a>that we should love one another, </span>

<span class="verse 1gi_3_20"><sup>20</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 4:4, 5)">⚓</a>For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_3_21"><sup>21</sup>Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 10:22; 1 John 2:28; 5:14)">⚓</a>we have confidence toward God. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_3_22"><sup>22</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 34:15; (John 15:7); 1 John 5:14, 15">⚓</a>whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 8:29; Heb. 13:21">⚓</a>and do those things that are pleasing in His sight. </span>
<span class="verse 1gi_3_23"><sup>23</sup>And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 22:39">⚓</a>and love one another, as He gave us commandment.<br/></span>
