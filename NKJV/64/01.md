<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>Greeting to Gaius</h3></div>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>The Elder,<br/> To the beloved Gaius, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 John 1">⚓</a>whom I love in truth:<br/></span>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_2"> <sup>2</sup>Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers. </span>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_3"><sup>3</sup>For I <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 John 4">⚓</a>rejoiced greatly when brethren came and testified of the truth <i>that</i> <i>is</i> in you, just as you walk in the truth. </span>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_4"><sup>4</sup>I have no greater <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Thess. 2:19, 20; 2 John 4">⚓</a>joy than to hear that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 4:15)">⚓</a>my children walk in truth.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Gaius Commended for Generosity</h3></div>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_5"> <sup>5</sup>Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do for the brethren and for strangers, </span>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_6"><sup>6</sup>who have borne witness of your love before the church. <i>If</i> you send them forward on their journey in a manner worthy of God, you will do well, </span>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_7"><sup>7</sup>because they went forth for His name’s sake, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 9:12, 15">⚓</a>taking nothing from the Gentiles. </span>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_8"><sup>8</sup>We therefore ought to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 10:40; Rom. 12:13; Heb. 13:2; 1 Pet. 4:9">⚓</a>receive such, that we may become fellow workers for the truth.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Diotrephes and Demetrius</h3></div>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_9"> <sup>9</sup>I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us. </span>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_10"><sup>10</sup>Therefore, if I come, I will call to mind his deeds which he does, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 10:8, 10">⚓</a>prating against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting <i>them</i> out of the church.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_11"> <sup>11</sup>Beloved, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 34:14; 37:27; Rom. 14:19; 1 Thess. 5:15; 1 Tim. 6:11; 2 Tim. 2:22">⚓</a>do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 John 2:29; 3:10)">⚓</a>He who does good is of God, but he who does evil has not seen <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 John 3:10)">⚓</a>God.<br/></span>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_12"> <sup>12</sup>Demetrius <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 6:3; 1 Tim. 3:7">⚓</a>has a <i>good</i> testimony from all, and from the truth itself. And we also bear witness, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 19:35; 21:24">⚓</a>and you know that our testimony is true.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Farewell Greeting</h3></div>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_13"> <sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 John 12">⚓</a>I had many things to write, but I do not wish to write to you with pen and ink; </span>
<span class="verse 3gi_1_14"><sup>14</sup>but I hope to see you shortly, and we shall speak face to face.<br/> Peace to you. Our friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.<br/></span>
