<div class="title"><h1>1</h1><h3>Greeting to the Called</h3></div>
<span class="verse giu_1_1"> <sup>1</sup>Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 1:13">⚓</a>brother of James,<br/> To those who are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 1:7">⚓</a>called, sanctified by God the Father, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 17:11, 12">⚓</a>preserved in Jesus Christ:<br/></span>
<span class="verse giu_1_2"> <sup>2</sup>Mercy, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Pet. 1:2; 2 Pet. 1:2">⚓</a>peace, and love be multiplied to you.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Contend for the Faith</h3></div>
<span class="verse giu_1_3"> <sup>3</sup>Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Titus 1:4">⚓</a>concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 1:27">⚓</a>you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. </span>
<span class="verse giu_1_4"><sup>4</sup>For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Old and New Apostates</h3></div>
<span class="verse giu_1_5"> <sup>5</sup>But I want to remind you, though you once knew this, that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:51; 1 Cor. 10:5–10; Heb. 3:16">⚓</a>the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. </span>
<span class="verse giu_1_6"><sup>6</sup>And the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day; </span>
<span class="verse giu_1_7"><sup>7</sup>as <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:24; 2 Pet. 2:6">⚓</a>Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giu_1_8"> <sup>8</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 2:10">⚓</a>Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 22:28">⚓</a>speak evil of dignitaries. </span>
<span class="verse giu_1_9"><sup>9</sup>Yet Michael the archangel, in contending with the devil, when he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a reviling accusation, but said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 3:2">⚓</a>“The Lord rebuke you!” </span>
<span class="verse giu_1_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 2:12">⚓</a>But these speak evil of whatever they do not know; and whatever they know naturally, like brute beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves. </span>
<span class="verse giu_1_11"><sup>11</sup>Woe to them! For they have gone in the way <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 4:3–8; Heb. 11:4; 1 John 3:12">⚓</a>of Cain, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 31:16; 2 Pet. 2:15; Rev. 2:14">⚓</a>have run greedily in the error of Balaam for profit, and perished <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Num. 16:1–3, 31–35">⚓</a>in the rebellion of Korah.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Apostates Depraved and Doomed</h3></div>
<span class="verse giu_1_12"> <sup>12</sup>These are spots in your love feasts, while they feast with you without fear, serving only themselves. They are clouds without water, carried about by the winds; late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots; </span>
<span class="verse giu_1_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 57:20">⚓</a>raging waves of the sea, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Phil. 3:19)">⚓</a>foaming up their own shame; wandering stars <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 2:17; Jude 6">⚓</a>for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giu_1_14"> <sup>14</sup>Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men also, saying, “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, </span>
<span class="verse giu_1_15"><sup>15</sup>to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Sam. 2:3">⚓</a>harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Apostates Predicted</h3></div>
<span class="verse giu_1_16"> <sup>16</sup>These are grumblers, complainers, walking according to their own lusts; and they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 2:18">⚓</a>mouth great swelling words, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Prov. 28:21">⚓</a>flattering people to gain advantage. </span>
<span class="verse giu_1_17"><sup>17</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 3:2">⚓</a>But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ: </span>
<span class="verse giu_1_18"><sup>18</sup>how they told you that <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Acts 20:29; (1 Tim. 4:1); 2 Tim. 3:1; 4:3; 2 Pet. 3:3">⚓</a>there would be mockers in the last time who would walk according to their own ungodly lusts. </span>
<span class="verse giu_1_19"><sup>19</sup>These are sensual persons, who cause divisions, not having the Spirit.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Maintain Your Life with God</h3></div>
<span class="verse giu_1_20"> <sup>20</sup>But you, beloved, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 2:7; 1 Thess. 5:11">⚓</a>building yourselves up on your most holy faith, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rom. 8:26)">⚓</a>praying in the Holy Spirit, </span>
<span class="verse giu_1_21"><sup>21</sup>keep yourselves in the love of God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Titus 2:13; Heb. 9:28; 2 Pet. 3:12">⚓</a>looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.<br/></span>
<span class="verse giu_1_22"> <sup>22</sup>And on some have compassion, making a distinction; </span>
<span class="verse giu_1_23"><sup>23</sup>but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 11:14">⚓</a>others save with fear, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Amos 4:11; Zech. 3:2; 1 Cor. 3:15">⚓</a>pulling them out of the fire, hating even <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Zech. 3:4, 5); Rev. 3:4">⚓</a>the garment defiled by the flesh.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Glory to God</h3></div>
<span class="verse giu_1_24">  <sup>24</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Eph. 3:20)">⚓</a>Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Col. 1:22">⚓</a>to present you faultless<br/>   Before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy,<br/></span>
<span class="verse giu_1_25">   <sup>25</sup>To God our Savior,<br/>   Who alone is wise,<br/>   Be glory and majesty,<br/>   Dominion and power,<br/>   Both now and forever.<br/>   Amen.<br/></span>
