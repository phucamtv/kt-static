<div class="title"><h1>5</h1><h3>The Lamb Takes the Scroll</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_5_1"> <sup>1</sup>And I saw in the right <i>hand</i> of Him who sat on the throne <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 2:9, 10">⚓</a>a scroll written inside and on the back, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 29:11; Dan. 12:4">⚓</a>sealed with seven seals. </span>
<span class="verse kh_5_2"><sup>2</sup>Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 4:11; 5:9">⚓</a>“Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loose its seals?” </span>
<span class="verse kh_5_3"><sup>3</sup>And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it.<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_5_4"> <sup>4</sup>So I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open and read the scroll, or to look at it. </span>
<span class="verse kh_5_5"><sup>5</sup>But one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 49:9">⚓</a>the Lion of the tribe of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 7:14">⚓</a>Judah, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 11:1, 10; Rom. 15:12; Rev. 22:16">⚓</a>the Root of David, has <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 3:21">⚓</a>prevailed to open the scroll <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 6:1">⚓</a>and to loose its seven seals.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_5_6"> <sup>6</sup>And I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 53:7; (John 1:29; 1 Pet. 1:19)">⚓</a>a Lamb as though it had been slain, having seven horns and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Zech. 3:9; 4:10">⚓</a>seven eyes, which are <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 1:4; 3:1; 4:5">⚓</a>the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth. </span>
<span class="verse kh_5_7"><sup>7</sup>Then He came and took the scroll out of the right hand <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 4:2">⚓</a>of Him who sat on the throne.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Worthy Is the Lamb</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_5_8"> <sup>8</sup>Now when He had taken the scroll, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 4:8–10; 19:4">⚓</a>the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 141:2; Rev. 8:3">⚓</a>prayers of the saints. </span>
<span class="verse kh_5_9"><sup>9</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 14:3">⚓</a>they sang a new song, saying:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 4:11">⚓</a>“You are worthy to take the scroll,<br/>   And to open its seals;<br/>   For You were slain,<br/>   And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 1:29">⚓</a>have redeemed us to God <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Heb. 9:12; 1 Pet. 1:18, 19)">⚓</a>by Your blood<br/>   Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_5_10">   <sup>10</sup>And have made us <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:6">⚓</a>kings and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 61:6">⚓</a>priests to our God;<br/>   And we shall reign on the earth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_5_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, </span>
<span class="verse kh_5_12"><sup>12</sup>saying with a loud voice:<br/>  “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain<br/>   To receive power and riches and wisdom,<br/>   And strength and honor and glory and blessing!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_5_13"> <sup>13</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Phil. 2:10; Rev. 5:3">⚓</a>every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying:<br/>  <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 29:11; Rom. 9:5; 1 Tim. 6:16; 1 Pet. 4:11">⚓</a>“Blessing and honor and glory and power<br/>   <i>Be</i> to Him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 4:2, 3; 6:16; 20:11">⚓</a>who sits on the throne,<br/>   And to the Lamb, forever and ever!”<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_5_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then the four living creatures said, “Amen!” And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped Him who lives forever and ever.<br/></span>
