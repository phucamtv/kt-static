<span class="verse kh_8_1"> <sup>1</sup>When<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 6:1">⚓</a> He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. </span>
<span class="verse kh_8_2"><sup>2</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 18:10); Luke 1:19">⚓</a>And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Chr. 29:25–28">⚓</a>and to them were given seven trumpets. </span>
<span class="verse kh_8_3"><sup>3</sup>Then another angel, having a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense, that he should offer <i>it</i> with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 5:8">⚓</a>the prayers of all the saints upon <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 30:1; Rev. 8:3">⚓</a>the golden altar which was before the throne. </span>
<span class="verse kh_8_4"><sup>4</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 141:2; Luke 1:10">⚓</a>the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angel’s hand. </span>
<span class="verse kh_8_5"><sup>5</sup>Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw <i>it</i> to the earth. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:16; Rev. 11:19; 16:18">⚓</a>there were noises, thunderings, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 4:5">⚓</a>lightnings, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Sam. 22:8; 1 Kin. 19:11; Acts 4:31">⚓</a>and an earthquake.<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_8_6"> <sup>6</sup>So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>First Trumpet: Vegetation Struck</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_8_7"> <sup>7</sup>The first angel sounded: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 9:23; Is. 28:2; Ezek. 38:22; Joel 2:30">⚓</a>And hail and fire followed, mingled with blood, and they were thrown <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 16:2">⚓</a>to the earth. And a third <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 2:13; Rev. 9:4, 15–18">⚓</a>of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Second Trumpet: The Seas Struck</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_8_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then the second angel sounded: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 51:25; Amos 7:4">⚓</a>And <i>something</i> like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 7:17; Rev. 11:6; 16:3">⚓</a>and a third of the sea <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 14:19">⚓</a>became blood. </span>
<span class="verse kh_8_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 16:3">⚓</a>And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Third Trumpet: The Waters Struck</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_8_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then the third angel sounded: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 14:12; Rev. 6:13; 9:1">⚓</a>And a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 14:7; 16:4">⚓</a>and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. </span>
<span class="verse kh_8_11"><sup>11</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ruth 1:20">⚓</a>The name of the star is Wormwood. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:23">⚓</a>A third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died from the water, because it was made bitter.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Fourth Trumpet: The Heavens Struck</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_8_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 13:10; Joel 2:31; Amos 8:9; Matt. 24:29; Rev. 6:12">⚓</a>Then the fourth angel sounded: And a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_8_13"> <sup>13</sup>And I looked, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 14:6; 19:17">⚓</a>and I heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 9:12; 11:14; 12:12">⚓</a>“Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!”<br/></span>
