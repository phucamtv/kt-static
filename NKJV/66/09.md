<div class="title"><h1>9</h1><h3>Fifth Trumpet: The Locusts from the Bottomless Pit</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_9_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then the fifth angel sounded: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:18; Rev. 8:10">⚓</a>And I saw a star fallen from heaven to the earth. To him was given the key to <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 8:31; Rev. 9:2, 11; 17:8">⚓</a>the bottomless pit. </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_2"><sup>2</sup>And he opened the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace. So the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Joel 2:2, 10">⚓</a>sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke of the pit. </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_3"><sup>3</sup>Then out of the smoke locusts came upon the earth. And to them was given power, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 10:4; Judg. 7:12">⚓</a>as the scorpions of the earth have power. </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_4"><sup>4</sup>They were commanded <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 6:6">⚓</a>not to harm <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 8:7">⚓</a>the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only those men who do not have <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 12:23; Ezek. 9:4; Rev. 7:2, 3">⚓</a>the seal of God on their foreheads. </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_5"><sup>5</sup>And they were not given <i>authority</i> to kill them, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rev. 9:10; 11:7)">⚓</a>but to torment them <i>for</i> five months. Their torment <i>was</i> like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man. </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_6"><sup>6</sup>In those days <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 3:21; 7:15; Is. 2:19; Jer. 8:3; Rev. 6:16">⚓</a>men will seek death and will not find it; they will desire to die, and death will flee from them.<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_9_7"> <sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Joel 2:4">⚓</a>The shape of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Nah. 3:17">⚓</a>On their heads were crowns of something like gold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:8">⚓</a>and their faces <i>were</i> like the faces of men. </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_8"><sup>8</sup>They had hair like women’s hair, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Joel 1:6">⚓</a>their teeth were like lions’ <i>teeth.</i></span>
<span class="verse kh_9_9"><sup>9</sup>And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings <i>was</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 47:3; Joel 2:5–7">⚓</a>like the sound of chariots with many horses running into battle. </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_10"><sup>10</sup>They had tails like scorpions, and there were stings in their tails. Their power <i>was</i> to hurt men five months. </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_11"><sup>11</sup>And they had as king over them <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 2:2">⚓</a>the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew <i>is</i> Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_9_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 8:13; 11:14">⚓</a>One woe is past. Behold, still two more woes are coming after these things.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Sixth Trumpet: The Angels from the Euphrates</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_9_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then the sixth angel sounded: And I heard a voice from the four horns of the <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 8:3">⚓</a>golden altar which is before God, </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_14"><sup>14</sup>saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 15:18; Deut. 1:7; Josh. 1:4; Rev. 16:12">⚓</a>at the great river Euphrates.” </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_15"><sup>15</sup>So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released to kill a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 8:7–9; 9:18">⚓</a>third of mankind. </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_16"><sup>16</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 68:17; Dan. 7:10">⚓</a>the number of the army <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 38:4">⚓</a>of the horsemen <i>was</i> two hundred million; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 7:4">⚓</a>I heard the number of them. </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_17"><sup>17</sup>And thus I saw the horses in the vision: those who sat on them had breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Chr. 12:8; Is. 5:28, 29">⚓</a>and the heads of the horses <i>were</i> like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and brimstone. </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_18"><sup>18</sup>By these three <i>plagues</i> a third of mankind was killed—by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which came out of their mouths. </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_19"><sup>19</sup>For their power is in their mouth and in their tails; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 9:15">⚓</a>for their tails <i>are</i> like serpents, having heads; and with them they do harm.<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_9_20"> <sup>20</sup>But the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 31:29">⚓</a>did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 17:7; Deut. 32:17; Ps. 106:37; 1 Cor. 10:20">⚓</a>demons, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 115:4–7; 135:15–17; Dan. 5:23">⚓</a>and idols of gold, silver, brass, stone, and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk. </span>
<span class="verse kh_9_21"><sup>21</sup>And they did not repent of their murders <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 21:8; 22:15">⚓</a>or their sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts.<br/></span>
