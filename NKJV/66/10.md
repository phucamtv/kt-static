<div class="title"><h1>10</h1><h3>The Mighty Angel with the Little Book</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_10_1"> <sup>1</sup>I saw still another mighty angel coming down from heaven, clothed with a cloud. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 1:26–28; Rev. 4:3">⚓</a>And a rainbow <i>was</i> on <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 17:2; Rev. 1:16">⚓</a>his head, his face <i>was</i> like the sun, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 1:15">⚓</a>his feet like pillars of fire. </span>
<span class="verse kh_10_2"><sup>2</sup>He had a little book open in his hand. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 95:5; Matt. 28:18">⚓</a>And he set his right foot on the sea and <i>his</i> left <i>foot</i> on the land, </span>
<span class="verse kh_10_3"><sup>3</sup>and cried with a loud voice, as <i>when</i> a lion roars. When he cried out, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 29:3–9; Rev. 4:5; 8:5">⚓</a>seven thunders uttered their voices. </span>
<span class="verse kh_10_4"><sup>4</sup>Now when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 8:26; 12:4, 9; Rev. 22:10">⚓</a>“Seal up the things which the seven thunders uttered, and do not write them.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_10_5"> <sup>5</sup>The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 6:8; Deut. 32:40; Dan. 12:7">⚓</a>raised up his hand to heaven </span>
<span class="verse kh_10_6"><sup>6</sup>and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 1:1; Ex. 20:11; Neh. 9:6; Rev. 4:11">⚓</a>who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 12:7; Rev. 16:17">⚓</a>that there should be delay no longer, </span>
<span class="verse kh_10_7"><sup>7</sup>but <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 11:15">⚓</a>in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>John Eats the Little Book</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_10_8"> <sup>8</sup>Then the voice which I heard from heaven spoke to me again and said, “Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the earth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_10_9"> <sup>9</sup>So I went to the angel and said to him, “Give me the little book.”<br/> And he said to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 15:16; Ezek. 2:8; 3:1–3">⚓</a>“Take and eat it; and it will make your stomach bitter, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_10_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 3:3">⚓</a>and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. But when I had eaten it, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 2:10">⚓</a>my stomach became bitter. </span>
<span class="verse kh_10_11"><sup>11</sup>And he said to me, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings.”<br/></span>
