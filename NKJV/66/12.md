<div class="title"><h1>12</h1><h3>The Woman, the Child, and the Dragon</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_12_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars. </span>
<span class="verse kh_12_2"><sup>2</sup>Then being with child, she cried out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 26:17; 66:6–9; Mic. 4:9; Gal. 4:19">⚓</a>in labor and in pain to give birth.<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_12_3"> <sup>3</sup>And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 13:1; 17:3, 7, 9">⚓</a>a great, fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads. </span>
<span class="verse kh_12_4"><sup>4</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 9:10, 19">⚓</a>His tail drew a third <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 8:7, 12">⚓</a>of the stars of heaven <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 8:10">⚓</a>and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 12:2">⚓</a>before the woman who was ready to give birth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 1:16; Matt. 2:16">⚓</a>to devour her Child as soon as it was born. </span>
<span class="verse kh_12_5"><sup>5</sup>She bore a male Child <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 2:9; Is. 7:14; 9:6; Rev. 2:27; 19:15">⚓</a>who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her Child was <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 24:51; Acts 1:9–11">⚓</a>caught up to God and His throne. </span>
<span class="verse kh_12_6"><sup>6</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 12:4, 14">⚓</a>the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 11:3; 13:5">⚓</a>one thousand two hundred and sixty days.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Satan Thrown Out of Heaven</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_12_7"> <sup>7</sup>And war broke out in heaven: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 10:13, 21; 12:1; Jude 9">⚓</a>Michael and his angels fought <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 20:2">⚓</a>with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, </span>
<span class="verse kh_12_8"><sup>8</sup>but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer. </span>
<span class="verse kh_12_9"><sup>9</sup>So <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 10:18; John 12:31">⚓</a>the great dragon was cast out, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 3:1, 4; 2 Cor. 11:3; Rev. 12:15; 20:2">⚓</a>that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 20:3">⚓</a>who deceives the whole world; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 9:1">⚓</a>he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_12_10"> <sup>10</sup>Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 11:15">⚓</a>“Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Job 1:9, 11; 2:5; Zech. 3:1">⚓</a>who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down. </span>
<span class="verse kh_12_11"><sup>11</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 16:20">⚓</a>they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Luke 14:26; (Rev. 2:10)">⚓</a>and they did not love their lives to the death. </span>
<span class="verse kh_12_12"><sup>12</sup>Therefore <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 96:11; Is. 44:23; Rev. 18:20">⚓</a>rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 8:13">⚓</a>Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 10:6">⚓</a>because he knows that he has a short time.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Woman Persecuted</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_12_13"> <sup>13</sup>Now when the dragon saw that he had been cast to the earth, he persecuted <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 12:5">⚓</a>the woman who gave birth to the male <i>Child.</i></span>
<span class="verse kh_12_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 19:4; Deut. 32:11; Is. 40:31">⚓</a>But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 12:6">⚓</a>that she might fly <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 17:3">⚓</a>into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:25; 12:7">⚓</a>for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent. </span>
<span class="verse kh_12_15"><sup>15</sup>So the serpent <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 59:19">⚓</a>spewed water out of his mouth like a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the flood. </span>
<span class="verse kh_12_16"><sup>16</sup>But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon had spewed out of his mouth. </span>
<span class="verse kh_12_17"><sup>17</sup>And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.<br/></span>
