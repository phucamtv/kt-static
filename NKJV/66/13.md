<div class="title"><h1>13</h1><h3>The Beast from the Sea</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_13_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:2, 7">⚓</a>a beast rising up out of the sea, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 12:3">⚓</a>having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:8; 11:36; Rev. 17:3">⚓</a>blasphemous name. </span>
<span class="verse kh_13_2"><sup>2</sup>Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like <i>the</i> <i>feet</i> <i>of</i> a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 12:3, 9; 13:4, 12">⚓</a>dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority. </span>
<span class="verse kh_13_3"><sup>3</sup>And I saw one of his heads <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 13:12, 14">⚓</a>as if it had been mortally wounded, and his deadly wound was healed. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 17:8">⚓</a>all the world marveled and followed the beast. </span>
<span class="verse kh_13_4"><sup>4</sup>So they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 15:11; Is. 46:5; Rev. 18:18">⚓</a>“Who <i>is</i> like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?”<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_13_5"> <sup>5</sup>And he was given <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:8, 11, 20, 25; 11:36; 2 Thess. 2:3">⚓</a>a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and he was given authority to continue for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 11:2">⚓</a>forty-two months. </span>
<span class="verse kh_13_6"><sup>6</sup>Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(John 1:14; Col. 2:9)">⚓</a>His tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven. </span>
<span class="verse kh_13_7"><sup>7</sup>It was granted to him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:21; Rev. 11:7">⚓</a>to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 11:18">⚓</a>authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation. </span>
<span class="verse kh_13_8"><sup>8</sup>All who dwell on the earth will worship him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ex. 32:32; (Rev. 20:12–15)">⚓</a>whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Matt. 25:34; Rev. 17:8">⚓</a>from the foundation of the world.<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_13_9"> <sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 2:7">⚓</a>If anyone has an ear, let him hear. </span>
<span class="verse kh_13_10"><sup>10</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 33:1; Jer. 15:2; 43:11">⚓</a>He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 9:6; Matt. 26:52; Rev. 11:18">⚓</a>he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 6:12; Rev. 14:12">⚓</a>Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Beast from the Earth</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_13_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then I saw another beast <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 11:7">⚓</a>coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and spoke like a dragon. </span>
<span class="verse kh_13_12"><sup>12</sup>And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 13:3, 4">⚓</a>whose deadly wound was healed. </span>
<span class="verse kh_13_13"><sup>13</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Deut. 13:1; Matt. 24:24; 2 Thess. 2:9; Rev. 16:14">⚓</a>He performs great signs, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Kin. 18:38; 2 Kin. 1:10; Luke 9:54; Rev. 11:5; 20:9">⚓</a>so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. </span>
<span class="verse kh_13_14"><sup>14</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 12:9">⚓</a>And he deceives those who dwell on the earth <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Thess. 2:9">⚓</a>by those signs which he was granted to do in the sight of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who was wounded by the sword <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Kin. 20:7">⚓</a>and lived. </span>
<span class="verse kh_13_15"><sup>15</sup>He was granted <i>power</i> to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 16:2">⚓</a>and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed. </span>
<span class="verse kh_13_16"><sup>16</sup>He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gal. 6:17; Rev. 7:3; 14:9; 20:4">⚓</a>to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, </span>
<span class="verse kh_13_17"><sup>17</sup>and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 14:9–11">⚓</a>the name of the beast, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 15:2">⚓</a>or the number of his name.<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_13_18"> <sup>18</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 17:9">⚓</a>Here is wisdom.
