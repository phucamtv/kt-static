<div class="title"><h1>14</h1><h3>The Lamb and the 144,000</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_14_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then I looked, and behold, a <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 5:6">⚓</a>Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 7:4; 14:3">⚓</a>one hundred <i>and</i> forty-four thousand, having His Father’s name <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 9:4; Rev. 7:3; 22:4">⚓</a>written on their foreheads. </span>
<span class="verse kh_14_2"><sup>2</sup>And I heard a voice from heaven, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 1:15; 19:6">⚓</a>like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder. And I heard the sound of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 5:8">⚓</a>harpists playing their harps. </span>
<span class="verse kh_14_3"><sup>3</sup>They sang as it were a new song before the throne, before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one could learn that song <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 5:9">⚓</a>except the hundred <i>and</i> forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth. </span>
<span class="verse kh_14_4"><sup>4</sup>These are the ones who were not defiled with women, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Matt. 19:12; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:27)">⚓</a>for they are virgins. These are the ones <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 3:4; 7:17">⚓</a>who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 5:9">⚓</a>were redeemed from <i>among</i> men, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 12:23; James 1:18">⚓</a><i>being</i> firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. </span>
<span class="verse kh_14_5"><sup>5</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 32:2; Zeph. 3:13; Mal. 2:6; John 1:47; 1 Pet. 2:22">⚓</a>in their mouth was found no deceit, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 5:27">⚓</a>they are without fault before the throne of God.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Proclamations of Three Angels</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_14_6"> <sup>6</sup>Then I saw another angel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 8:13">⚓</a>flying in the midst of heaven, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eph. 3:9">⚓</a>having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth—<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 13:7">⚓</a>to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people— </span>
<span class="verse kh_14_7"><sup>7</sup>saying with a loud voice, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 11:18">⚓</a>“Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Neh. 9:6">⚓</a>and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_14_8"> <sup>8</sup>And another angel followed, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 21:9; Jer. 51:8; Rev. 18:2">⚓</a>“Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 51:7; Rev. 17:2">⚓</a>she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_14_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 13:14, 15; 14:11">⚓</a>“If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives <i>his</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 13:16">⚓</a>mark on his forehead or on his hand, </span>
<span class="verse kh_14_10"><sup>10</sup>he himself <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 75:8">⚓</a>shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 18:6">⚓</a>poured out full strength into <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 16:19">⚓</a>the cup of His indignation. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 20:10">⚓</a>He shall be tormented with <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 19:24; Ezek. 38:22; 2 Thess. 1:7; Rev. 19:20">⚓</a>fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. </span>
<span class="verse kh_14_11"><sup>11</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 34:8–10; Rev. 18:9, 18; 19:3">⚓</a>the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_14_12"> <sup>12</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 13:10">⚓</a>Here is the patience of the saints; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 12:17">⚓</a>here <i>are</i> those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_14_13"> <sup>13</sup>Then I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, “Write: <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Eccl. 4:1, 2">⚓</a>‘Blessed <i>are</i> the dead <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="1 Cor. 15:18; (1 Thess. 4:16)">⚓</a>who die in the Lord from now on.’ ”<br/> “Yes,” says the Spirit, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Thess. 1:7; Heb. 4:9, 10; Rev. 6:11">⚓</a>“that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(1 Cor. 3:11–15; 15:58)">⚓</a>them.”<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Reaping the Earth’s Harvest</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_14_14"> <sup>14</sup>Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat <i>One</i> like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle. </span>
<span class="verse kh_14_15"><sup>15</sup>And another angel <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 16:17">⚓</a>came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Joel 3:13; Mark 4:29; Rev. 14:18">⚓</a>“Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 51:33; (Matt. 13:39–41)">⚓</a>of the earth is ripe.” </span>
<span class="verse kh_14_16"><sup>16</sup>So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Reaping the Grapes of Wrath</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_14_17"> <sup>17</sup>Then another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_14_18"> <sup>18</sup>And another angel came out from the altar, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 16:8">⚓</a>who had power over fire, and he cried with a loud cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Joel 3:13; Mark 4:29; Rev. 14:15">⚓</a>“Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe.” </span>
<span class="verse kh_14_19"><sup>19</sup>So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw <i>it</i> into <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 63:2; Rev. 19:15">⚓</a>the great winepress of the wrath of God. </span>
<span class="verse kh_14_20"><sup>20</sup>And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 63:3; Lam. 1:15; Rev. 19:15">⚓</a>the winepress was trampled <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Heb. 13:12; Rev. 11:8">⚓</a>outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 34:3">⚓</a>up to the horses’ bridles, for one thousand six hundred furlongs.<br/></span>
