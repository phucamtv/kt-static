<div class="title"><h1>18</h1><h3>The Fall of Babylon the Great</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_18_1"> <sup>1</sup>After<a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 17:1, 7">⚓</a> these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 43:2">⚓</a>and the earth was illuminated with his glory. </span>
<span class="verse kh_18_2"><sup>2</sup>And he cried mightily with a loud voice, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 13:19; 21:9; Jer. 51:8; Rev. 14:8">⚓</a>“Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 13:21; 34:11, 13–15; Jer. 50:39; 51:37; Zeph. 2:14">⚓</a>has become a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every foul spirit, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 14:23">⚓</a>a cage for every unclean and hated bird! </span>
<span class="verse kh_18_3"><sup>3</sup>For all the nations <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 51:7; Rev. 14:8">⚓</a>have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 47:15">⚓</a>and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the abundance of her luxury.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_18_4"> <sup>4</sup>And I heard another voice from heaven saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 48:20">⚓</a>“Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues. </span>
<span class="verse kh_18_5"><sup>5</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Gen. 18:20">⚓</a>For her sins have reached to heaven, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 16:19">⚓</a>God has remembered her iniquities. </span>
<span class="verse kh_18_6"><sup>6</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ps. 137:8; Jer. 50:15, 29">⚓</a>Render to her just as she rendered to you, and repay her double according to her works; <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 14:10">⚓</a>in the cup which she has mixed, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 16:19">⚓</a>mix double for her. </span>
<span class="verse kh_18_7"><sup>7</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 28:2–8">⚓</a>In the measure that she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, in the same measure give her torment and sorrow; for she says in her heart, ‘I sit <i>as</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 47:7, 8; Zeph. 2:15">⚓</a>queen, and am no widow, and will not see sorrow.’ </span>
<span class="verse kh_18_8"><sup>8</sup>Therefore her plagues will come <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 47:9; Jer. 50:31; Rev. 18:10">⚓</a>in one day—death and mourning and famine. And <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 17:16">⚓</a>she will be utterly burned with fire, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 50:34; Heb. 10:31; Rev. 11:17">⚓</a>for strong <i>is</i> the Lord God who judges her.<br/></span>

<div class="title"><h3>Finality of Babylon’s Fall</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_18_21"> <sup>21</sup>Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw <i>it</i> into the sea, saying, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Jer. 51:63, 64">⚓</a>“Thus with violence the great city Babylon shall be thrown down, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 12:8; 16:20">⚓</a>shall not be found anymore. </span>
