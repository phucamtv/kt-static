<div class="title"><h1>20</h1><h3>Satan Bound 1,000 Years</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_20_1"> <sup>1</sup>Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 1:18; 9:1">⚓</a>having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. </span>
<span class="verse kh_20_2"><sup>2</sup>He laid hold of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 24:22; 2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 6">⚓</a>the dragon, that serpent of old, who is <i>the</i> Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; </span>
<span class="verse kh_20_3"><sup>3</sup>and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 6:17; Matt. 27:66">⚓</a>set a seal on him, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 12:9; 20:8, 10">⚓</a>so that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years were finished. But after these things he must be released for a little while.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Saints Reign with Christ 1,000 Years</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_20_4"> <sup>4</sup>And I saw <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:9; Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:30">⚓</a>thrones, and they sat on them, and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:22; (1 Cor. 6:2, 3)">⚓</a>judgment was committed to them. Then <i>I</i> <i>saw</i><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 6:9">⚓</a>the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 13:12">⚓</a>who had not worshiped the beast <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 13:15">⚓</a>or his image, and had not received <i>his</i> mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="John 14:19">⚓</a>lived and <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rom. 8:17; 2 Tim. 2:12">⚓</a>reigned with Christ for a thousand years. </span>
<span class="verse kh_20_5"><sup>5</sup>But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This <i>is</i> the first resurrection. </span>
<span class="verse kh_20_6"><sup>6</sup>Blessed and holy <i>is</i> he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(Rev. 2:11; 20:14)">⚓</a>the second death has no power, but they shall be <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 61:6; 1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6">⚓</a>priests of God and of Christ, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 20:4">⚓</a>and shall reign with Him a thousand years.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>Satanic Rebellion Crushed</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_20_7"> <sup>7</sup>Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison </span>
<span class="verse kh_20_8"><sup>8</sup>and will go out <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 12:9; 20:3, 10">⚓</a>to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 38:2; 39:1, 6">⚓</a>Gog and Magog, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 16:14">⚓</a>to gather them together to battle, whose number <i>is</i> as the sand of the sea. </span>
<span class="verse kh_20_9"><sup>9</sup><a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 8:8; Ezek. 38:9, 16">⚓</a>They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. </span>
<span class="verse kh_20_10"><sup>10</sup>The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 19:20; 20:14, 15">⚓</a>where the beast and the false prophet <i>are.</i> And they <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 14:10">⚓</a>will be tormented day and night forever and ever.<br/></span>
<div class="title"><h3>The Great White Throne Judgment</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_20_11"> <sup>11</sup>Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="2 Pet. 3:7; Rev. 21:1">⚓</a>the earth and the heaven fled away. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 2:35; Rev. 12:8">⚓</a>And there was found no place for them. </span>
<span class="verse kh_20_12"><sup>12</sup>And I saw the dead, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 19:5">⚓</a>small and great, standing before God, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Dan. 7:10">⚓</a>and books were opened.
