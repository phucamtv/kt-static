<span class="verse kh_21_1"> <sup>1</sup>Now <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 65:17; 66:22; (2 Pet. 3:13)">⚓</a>I saw a new heaven and a new earth, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="(2 Pet. 3:10); Rev. 20:11">⚓</a>for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.

<span class="verse kh_21_2"><sup>2</sup>Then I, John, saw <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 52:1; (Gal. 4:26); Heb. 11:10">⚓</a>the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 54:5; 2 Cor. 11:2">⚓</a>as a bride adorned for her husband. </span>
<span class="verse kh_21_3"><sup>3</sup>And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Lev. 26:11; Ezek. 43:7; 2 Cor. 6:16">⚓</a>the tabernacle of God <i>is</i> with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people.

<span class="verse kh_21_5"> <sup>5</sup>Then <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 4:2, 9; 20:11">⚓</a>He who sat on the throne said, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 43:19; 2 Cor. 5:17">⚓</a>“Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 19:9; 22:6">⚓</a>these words are true and faithful.”<br/></span>
<span class="verse kh_21_6"> <sup>6</sup>And He said to me, <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 10:6; 16:17">⚓</a>“It is done! <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 1:8; 22:13">⚓</a>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Is. 12:3; 55:1; John 4:10; Rev. 7:17; 22:17">⚓</a>I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts. </span>

<div class="title"><h3>The New Jerusalem</h3></div>
<span class="verse kh_21_9"> <sup>9</sup>Then one of <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 15:1">⚓</a>the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came to me and talked with me, saying, “Come, I will show you <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 19:7; 21:2">⚓</a>the bride, the Lamb’s wife.” </span>
<span class="verse kh_21_10"><sup>10</sup>And he carried me away <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Rev. 1:10">⚓</a>in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me <a data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="bottom" title="Ezek. 48">⚓</a>the great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, </span>
